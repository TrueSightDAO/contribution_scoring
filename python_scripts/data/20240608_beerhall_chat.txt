[11/11/22, 10:44:38 PM] Garis Pang: It’s not the matter of long or short term, when lower price struck the margin call of fear in the souls of peoples, markets will tail spinning into the abyss of no returns.

[11/12/22, 1:09:15 PM] Gary Teh: Hey folks as you all know a bunch of us have been working on rolling out the cypher defense project to help protect all network members against scams and phishing attacks in the web3 space. 

We are about to roll out the solution (which comes in the form of a chrome extension)

There are a bunch of actions that members can engage via the chrome extension to earn governance tokens once its rolled out. 

These actions are described here on this page. It is also the page that will be shown to all users when they first install Cypher defense. 
https://truesight.me/dao/chrome_installed
[11/12/22, 1:10:09 PM] Aga - DAOist: https://youtu.be/LWq77i9mIRE
[11/12/22, 1:10:40 PM] Gary Teh: To facilitate ease for network members to determine how much governance tokens to be granted for each action, we have created a Google form that members in this channel can now go vote. 

The weighted average of each item for voting will automatically be incorporated into the system. Please do go submit your vote there. Each person can only vote once. However you can modify your vote as and when you please. 

https://truesight.me/dao/cypher/vote
[11/12/22, 1:11:09 PM] Aga - DAOist: What about Tether? 🤔this can come next.. already huge fluctuations..
[11/12/22, 1:11:17 PM] Tres Garcia: I was tracking 1/13 of ownership of SOL (7%)
BUT with it connected to the rest of the eco system, I am wondering how much of the original $13B was held by FTX and associates. 

I am staying to my original thesis that SOL sould be a % of ETH.
[11/12/22, 1:13:02 PM] Peter Peng: I say, let Solana do what they want.
[11/12/22, 1:13:04 PM] Tres Garcia: I just saw that... I am shocked that they have survived this long. I thought evergrand  debt assets was going to wipe them out back in Nov 21.

[11/12/22, 1:14:52 PM] Tres Garcia: I don't play with Stable coins. Period... I just put cash on and off exchange.
[11/12/22, 1:14:53 PM] Peter Peng: Should we depeg Tether just for fun?

[11/12/22, 1:16:30 PM] Peter Peng: Fed Coin
[11/12/22, 1:17:03 PM] Peter Peng: I’ll break UST like a fucking piggy bank

[11/12/22, 1:29:00 PM] Peter Peng: Decriminalize it
[11/12/22, 1:30:38 PM] Peter Peng: After this Covid lockdown we need to get the party started and everyone back in the office, sniffing lines and building Web3
[11/12/22, 1:31:03 PM] Peter Peng: This is the only way I know how to get everyone back in office
[11/12/22, 1:31:10 PM] Peter Peng: Like the 80’s
[11/12/22, 1:31:45 PM] Aga - DAOist: Why is is in TDG tokens and not with a separate tokenomics? 

What people will want to see is the value of such token so I think we should ask people who will be potentially involved in reporting.. 🤔
[11/12/22, 1:31:54 PM] Gary Teh: But why not Quaaludes? Imagine destroying all the cars in the streets while driving under influence? 🤣

[11/12/22, 1:32:43 PM] Peter Peng: I think that’s why they banned them lol … I heard they were awesome
[11/12/22, 1:34:14 PM] Gary Teh: Well, It's all running under the same rubric system.

Right now, there is around USD0.003571428571429 backing each governance token that you are all holding

It will get further diluted as more tokens get issued out.
[11/12/22, 1:35:41 PM] Gary Teh: Once subscribers start utilizing the premium portion of the service, we will just sink the profit into the liquidity pool to increase the volume of USD backing the value of each token
[11/12/22, 1:35:51 PM] Gary Teh: There is not premium portion of the service yet
[11/12/22, 1:37:08 PM] Gary Teh: This our DAO's USDT holdings from the liquidity injection early on this year by the folks from the Global DAO Alliance.

[11/12/22, 1:38:21 PM] Aga - DAOist: I am not convinced to bind all projects with one token and make them depend on it.. 

And again, I believe that we should first ask our target group and not try to figure out ourselves.. based on their answers we can adjust the estimation.
[11/12/22, 1:38:30 PM] Peter Peng: I’ve only tried Soma, which is a muscle relaxer
[11/12/22, 1:38:30 PM] Gary Teh: No idea! I was only living vicariously through Leonardo Dicaprio
[11/12/22, 1:38:38 PM] Peter Peng: Oh Hahahha
[11/12/22, 1:39:25 PM] Gary Teh: Good point. Let's see what they say. 

Haven't heard anything from them recently. My sense is they probably lost interest and have moved on to something else more urgent 🤣
[11/12/22, 1:40:25 PM] Gary Teh: The mechanism also allows the target audience to submit their estimations and that gets reflected in the tokenomics
[11/12/22, 1:43:16 PM] Aga - DAOist: I am talking about those who are on the market everyday experencing different issues that they could report.. maybe some people involved in DAOs or trading 🤔
[11/12/22, 1:43:42 PM] Gary Teh: I see. 🙂👍
[11/12/22, 2:07:58 PM] Peter Peng: Ever since “FAANG” turned to “MAANG” big tech dominance has dwindled

[11/12/22, 2:22:39 PM] Peter Peng: NFTs and DAOs
[11/12/22, 2:23:34 PM] Peter Peng: But I think Dapps will create the largest Web3 companies
[11/12/22, 2:24:21 PM] Peter Peng: We also need to figure out this FedCoin
[11/12/22, 2:25:17 PM] Peter Peng: I personally think it should be a coin that drives the AI Economy, but I’m biased
[11/12/22, 2:26:31 PM] Peter Peng: It will take control of the World Bank
[11/12/22, 2:26:44 PM] Peter Peng: 🌎
[11/12/22, 2:27:32 PM] Tres Garcia: Technically the FED coin is the DAO. The people vote in elections for representation.
[11/12/22, 2:28:14 PM] Tres Garcia: And just like every other token.... They keep printing. (*Some inflation is higher > Others
[11/12/22, 2:29:15 PM] Peter Peng: My concern is a bunch of DAOs competing
[11/12/22, 2:29:31 PM] Peter Peng: Because I don’t lose 😈
[11/12/22, 2:29:37 PM] Tres Garcia: Competition = Good
Gets rid of the losers
[11/12/22, 2:30:32 PM] Gary Teh: I will probably just end up taking a small position in a lot of these DAOs to spread my financial risk if I was very profit oriented 🤣
[11/12/22, 2:31:26 PM] Gary Teh: But since I am more of Do Nothing kind of person, so will probably head out to the desert!

[11/12/22, 2:57:31 PM] Gary Teh: Another approach is to establish a utility token class that is awarded to the contributors of those listed actions specific to the scope of that project 

That is generally how I observe was done by other web3 projects
‎[11/12/22, 3:00:16 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: ‎image omitted
[11/12/22, 3:00:48 PM] Gary Teh: That utility token class ensures up becoming the stable coin portion where the dao makes the spread between the buy and sell

And a portion of the profits from operations get siphoned off to back the governance tokens (periodically paid out in USDC dividends)  and these are awarded to folks who helped build out the project
[11/12/22, 3:01:58 PM] Gary Teh: It just boils down to what is the best way to incentivize all the players in the ecosystem to participate so that the ecosystem can function as a healthy network
[11/12/22, 3:02:43 PM] Gary Teh: So everyone who ends up in Forbes ends up in jail at some point? 🤔🤣

[11/12/22, 3:15:23 PM] Gary Teh: Me too bro!

First time locked in the Xinjiang area of China when being suspected of inciting insurgence amongst the uighurs to rise up against the Chinese government 

Second time in Azerbaijani after the screw up with the letter of invitation 🤣

[11/12/22, 3:16:09 PM] Gary Teh: Had to bribe my way out both times

Thankfully it was before the Fed triggered off massive inflation
[11/12/22, 3:18:37 PM] Peter Peng: Haha nice 👍
[11/12/22, 3:20:15 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure the bribes would be costing a fortune in todays dollars. Might have ended up deciding it was cheaper to just stay in jail and do nothing if it were to happen again in todays environment

[11/12/22, 3:34:51 PM] Gary Teh: Ironically Do Nothing stills ends up becoming the default when the bull market comes around as there are too much money chasing after too little of the available resources to do any stuff and key resources become too expensive to do anything 🤣

[11/13/22, 4:35:04 AM] Peter Peng: But they obviously don’t want you to know that.

One of the conclusion surfaced so far is that it seems possible depending on the types of protocol implemented that AIs might end up owning the various networks in the future and humans become just secondary players

[11/13/22, 5:27:05 PM] Peter Peng: Investors should transfer that $ to crypto
[11/13/22, 5:27:32 PM] Peter Peng: Blockchain is going to take over everything LFG 🚀
[11/13/22, 5:27:59 PM] Gary Teh: Can we make a fake Elon Musk account and then Twitter lose billions as well? 

Wait... Twitter was already losing billions before Elon Musk bought it. 🤣
[11/13/22, 5:28:55 PM] Peter Peng: Haha Elon is already losing billions, we don’t even need to try. He will be the next SBF, just wait. 😎
[11/13/22, 5:30:40 PM] Peter Peng: The collapse of Twitter will be a fall on Biblical proportions

Very profitable. I was literally trading on these kinds of fake news from 2017 all the way till just before the pandemic 🤩
[11/13/22, 5:41:51 PM] Dan: This is all going to likely lead to KYC for verified on Twitter. What are people’s thoughts on that idea?

You should periodically receive the sell off email from edgar our resident AI

At that point it’s basically your call to figure out where the Fakeness is 😎
[11/13/22, 5:43:42 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why they call it the “Brave Browser”
[11/13/22, 5:44:49 PM] Gary Teh: I have made USD4 so far from the brave browser

I was thinking of replicating that same monetization model for cypher defense just this afternoon 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/cypher
[11/13/22, 5:45:05 PM] Dan: Definitely! I do receive those updates. Generally don’t do any trading myself outside of NFTs
[11/13/22, 5:45:34 PM] Dan: This is true?
[11/13/22, 5:45:56 PM] Gary Teh: If you are sure some symbols are indeed the result of fake news then make a bullish or bearish call. You get awarded TDG governance tokens for making the right calls
[11/13/22, 5:47:01 PM] Peter Peng: With blockchain everything can be monetized
[11/13/22, 5:47:22 PM] Dan: Gonna look into this more. Symbols for stocks specifically?
‎[11/13/22, 5:47:30 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[11/13/22, 5:47:56 PM] Gary Teh: Or even crypto. Crypto symbols generally end in -USD
[11/13/22, 5:48:20 PM] Dan: Got it
[11/13/22, 5:48:22 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure how this relates to anything but maybe the world will become more globalize
[11/13/22, 5:49:37 PM] Gary Teh: I sense it’s becoming more fragmented
[11/13/22, 5:49:54 PM] Peter Peng: The US is a global Petri dish 🧫 for the future… even more so NYC… we are changing the world
[11/13/22, 5:50:32 PM] Peter Peng: It will be slightly uncomfortable but worth seeing the change
[11/13/22, 5:51:05 PM] Peter Peng: Time to automate the government
[11/13/22, 5:53:04 PM] Peter Peng: More unified in the Metaverse yet more fragmented in the real world.
[11/13/22, 5:53:16 PM] Peter Peng: All occurring simultaneously
[11/13/22, 5:53:29 PM] Peter Peng: Reaching quantum status
[11/13/22, 5:54:20 PM] Peter Peng: But again it all depends on perspective
[11/13/22, 5:54:53 PM] Peter Peng: Market down for you may mean market up for me, I think it depends on if you have an abundance mindset or not.

[11/13/22, 6:25:46 PM] Gary Teh: Also quickly realized the other day, the site where Ambarish invited to go hiking was a regular van life enclave facing the park by the bay. It’s right behind Google’s campus in Mountain View

Spent this afternoon hacking in Hacker Dojo (the ashram for hackers in the bay) another crowd funded venue that offers free workspace and coffee for all hackers. 

There is definitely a lot of abundance everywhere if only you know where to look
[11/13/22, 6:30:03 PM] Peter Peng: There have been times this year where I didn’t have much $ to even buy a meal so this is helpful. Money isn’t flowing like it should be so we know there is something wrong with the system.
[11/13/22, 6:30:09 PM] Dan: 100 percent agree! We just need to tune our vision to see it🔮
[11/13/22, 6:31:03 PM] Peter Peng: And I always have a lot of money to burn, so this is definitely strange.
[11/13/22, 6:34:37 PM] Gary Teh: What really stood to me during the 10 day vipassana silent meditation retreat when Geonka gave his regular evening lecture on what Guatama really did was that that dude jail broken his Android OS 🤣

A lot what the experiments I have been doing these past two years really felt like taking a legacy operating system (my lifestyle) and then doing a deep refactor of the way the code is ran to push it to the limits of what the environment can support 

Neo and the rest of the crew in the matrix were technically hackers. They basically jail broke their own Android OS to get out of the system 

I remembered when I was really having a lot of fun when we bought a bunch of Android handset and went about systemically jail breaking them to see where the boundaries were back during the Disconnect.me days

[11/13/22, 6:36:51 PM] Dan: Mesh network??
[11/13/22, 6:36:53 PM] Peter Peng: Or very inexpensive
[11/13/22, 6:37:23 PM] Peter Peng: Mesh network with edge computing
[11/13/22, 6:37:23 PM] Gary Teh: @17206665895 and @48606646246 been mentioning telepathy 🤔

If we can figure out a minimal viable working model, then we can systematize it
[11/13/22, 6:39:49 PM] Gary Teh: Zero to one is always the hardest (unknown to known)

Scaling from my perspective is just trivial ( one to many)
[11/13/22, 6:39:55 PM] Dan: Love it! If we tap into our natural forces I believe telepathy is real. Like how we can feel someone looking at us. Just more dialed. Would love to learn more
[11/13/22, 6:40:51 PM] Dan: Or are they talking about this… https://medium.com/frank-prempehs-blog/5g-will-help-usher-in-telepathic-communication-e0f488739545

[11/13/22, 6:41:49 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I been testing this hypothesis to validate the trend of increased demand for Asian actors after observing what I did back in Portland. The signal strength seem to be strong 

Just landed my first acting gig in Hollywood. Guess I will be very entertained when I arrive in LA a few weeks from now 🤣
[11/13/22, 6:41:53 PM] Peter Peng: We are all telepathic to some degree but I still feels sub conscious to me… maybe for good reason.
[11/13/22, 6:42:22 PM] Peter Peng: Congrats!

[11/13/22, 7:06:58 PM] Gary Teh: It was either Mujin for boy (birth name of Genghis Khan) or Mulan for girl. I wanted Mu (木) in the name somewhere since California was the land of the giant sequoia wood 

The entire mum’s side of the family gave a sight of relief when the baby turned out to be a girl. Somehow folks in the US think of Genghis as a mass murderer who committed unimaginable atrocities instead of a hero who freed his land of oppressors and later set the foundation for a dynasty 🤔
[11/13/22, 7:12:19 PM] Gary Teh: that was what inspired TrueSight DAO 

Personally it was never about money. It always been about making sure the system remains stable so that this kid have an adulthood to look forward to 🤩
[11/13/22, 7:18:18 PM] Dan: That’s a nice connection to the sequoia trees 🌳 Also that symbol’s symmetry looks perfect 

My history knowledge could use an upgrade. I sadly hadn’t seen him as the hero yet. Great to learn
[11/13/22, 7:24:02 PM] Gary Teh: Also her dad’s got Yang Wu as his heaven elemental. Figured it would be good to pass some of those over to her

Coincidentally Her heaven elemental is Yang Fire. So having some firewood as fodder is beneficial for her 🤣
[11/13/22, 7:26:42 PM] Gary Teh: The Chinese Hans were doing a whole bunch of fake news campaign back in the days to keep the nomads from uniting

Genghis saw through the bullshit and unified his tribe to cut the BS

Interestingly, the tribe he initially assembled were mainly made up of folks who were exiled from their own tribes. That ended up being a lot of people 

This was Another of those idea that inspired the way TrueSight DAO’s tokenomics was structured

[11/13/22, 7:31:30 PM] Gary Teh: Attila’s incursion into Europe also did help spread the gene in that area of the world

[11/13/22, 7:34:23 PM] Dan: That’s incredible to learn. Inspiring as well to read that this action is a part of the origin story for TrueSight DAO💚🌏🌱

[11/13/22, 7:58:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. No wonder
[11/13/22, 7:59:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: The government’s rhetoric is really brainwash working
[11/13/22, 7:59:52 PM] Peter Peng: In America the people run the government
[11/13/22, 8:00:08 PM] Peter Peng: And the people come from all over the world
[11/13/22, 8:00:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Travel more. And talk to people all over the world like Gary does. U will see many in the world has a different term for the usa
[11/13/22, 8:00:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: United Shit-Stirring Agency

[11/13/22, 8:04:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: Oh trust me. A lot of money is earned through war
[11/13/22, 8:05:15 PM] Peter Peng: Time to release the funds
[11/13/22, 8:05:28 PM] Peter Peng: End Quantitative tightening
[11/13/22, 8:06:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t for one moment think when usa says “10b will be sent to Ukraine for aid” means Ukraine actually receives 10B.
[11/13/22, 8:09:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: 10B is sent to American war manufacturers and equipment suppliers. 

It’s like a massive order sheet for American war business. 

Then whatever is made is sent to Ukraine and the money stays in usa. 

Meanwhile Ukraine will have a debt owed to usa for the 10B worth of goods as liability to be paid after the war for the next generations. 

Usa gains 10b of business for war companies locally. Made in America

And gains 10B worth of debt from Ukraine. 

Instant double on investment
[11/13/22, 8:10:03 PM] Peter Peng: Sometimes war is necessary to prevent the spread of evil.

Then many years later. When got exposed with oops there was never a single wmd in the first place. 

Meanwhile the gain is all the Iraq oil business
[11/13/22, 8:11:41 PM] Peter Peng: No one around the world is scared of China or Russia
[11/13/22, 8:12:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: Or it could be intentionally spreading evil. U need to make someone the bad guy to look like the good guy.

[11/13/22, 8:20:11 PM] Gary Teh: The really fascinating thing about the way the Mongolian horde was structured was how it organically resembles modern day holacracy 

Each unit makes up of ten and the leader is elected by the member of ten. This is the base building block upon which the entire Mongolian horde was constructed from. Like Lego bricks

Incompetent leaders in each unit were quickly replaced by the most capable amongst the ten 

And ten happens to the about the size of Jeff Bezos two pizza rule

The Wright brother’s for flight 

And Einstein’s for light bulb will be good reference 

First step will be to dig into research work done so far in the field of physics to identify if findings that might theoretically support parts of it. 

Then reproduce their research results to make sure their findings are reproducible 

Once done then start tinkering to figure out how all the nuts and bolts would fit together to support this new kind of communication that we call telepathy 

Right now I have not much bandwidth to do much in that department I am sure other keen and interested folks might be keen to dive down that rabbit hole with their spare time 🙂🙏

Since there is really a lot of upside (up to USD125K) per successful hit

Maybe there might be an opportunity to setup a shadow organization just to fully exploit this lack of care until everybody starts caring 

Thoughts?

It doesn’t make sense to break up monopolies especially tech platforms since it ends up screwing up a lot of the codebase and makes the end solution more convoluted than necessary 

I think a more effect approach would be to figure out how to convert these private properties into the property of the commons once these platforms achieve a certain scale

Just like no single person should monopolize all the water supply or clean air in the world.

[11/16/22, 2:38:44 AM] Peter Peng: US, China and NATO alliance. The Russians have proved time and again that they are too susceptible to corruption and cannot form sustainable governments. They also created the Communist Manifesto, who’s corrupt ideology has only spread evil, death and destruction globally.
[11/16/22, 3:10:55 AM] Peter Peng: I would suggest that during the occupation of Russia by the US, China, and NATO… that we dismantle their financial system, access to the internet (prevent cyberwarfare) and tightly control the food supply in order to prevent uprising. It’s the only way to keep a superpower like that under control and prevent them from doing more destruction.

Thanks for making the wonderful introduction @48691650760  🙂

@380997790108 would like to get to know our community and offer assistance in the future when there is opportunity to offer software development support 🤩

[11/16/22, 10:25:27 AM] Tres Garcia: Ugh.... 😑 Words Matter... 

As a 19+ veteran of the "Deep State" I am offended that he does not signal the difference between the Deep State and political parties that manage to get themselves fired every 4 to 8 years.

The deep state are the patriotic men and women who come to work every day and keep the lights on no matter who the president is or who is in control of the house and senate. 

This is everyone from the Military, SBA, IRS, Justice Dept., IC, and even the Post Office. 

No... There is not a great conspiracy between the US and Crypto... The Deep state has been watching this for over 10 years now and is not coordinated enough to react to the rate of change. Moreover, the Deep State is too busy keeping the govt. moving. If we wanted it off... We would just pass legislation shutting it off. End of story. No house of cards. No conspiracy. 

As for the actions of citizens that support the Democratic party... All of his statements are speculative and require further research as to what is true. Did donations go to Ukraine? Yes. 
Where they spend on US contractors providing goods? We do not know yet. 
Were the Donations stolen? No. 
Can we prove that the donations came from FTX user holding? No. Not at this time
So why are we complaining about donated funds? 

This guy is really smart if you see some of his other videos. (ie FXT and Alameda market maker = prop up FTX token) But he does not understand the magnitude of money as a weapon or the deep state.
[11/16/22, 10:27:17 AM] Tres Garcia: FTX / Alameda boils down to 3x things: Incompetence, Greed, and a complete lack of Due Diligence.

CZ got it right... Why did everyone miss it? Because CZ did his homework and kept digging.
[11/16/22, 10:52:15 AM] Tres Garcia: On the Good News Front!

[11/16/22, 11:18:56 AM] Tres Garcia: There are 2x versions. 
Version A) it is your mail man and every civil service worker keeping Govt services alive and working
Version B) is what people in tinfoil hats believe in
[11/16/22, 11:22:40 AM] Tres Garcia: There is a lot to unpack here: 
He is not wrong about a lot, but he is a bit misinformed. All in all it is a glimpse in where decentralized platforms are going as well as the hurdles they will face in combating disinformation, hate speech, terror promotion and poor journalism.

https://truesight.me/dao/chrome

please take sometime to install and test run it. If you have any proposed adjustments in mind let's surface here in this channel

We will do a round of feedback consolidation and then turn those feedbacks into bounty items listed here
https://truesight.me/dao/bounties

That way other members in the network who have spare cycles can then hunt for these bounties in exchange for governance tokens

------- 
- Phase 0: Where we are at. 

- Phase 1: we do a private round of adjustments amongst ourselves before we do the next round of roll out to all the folks who have responded to our LinkedIn poll a few weeks ago (around 100+ of them)

- Phase 2: Roll out to all 37K registered users of GetData.IO

- Phase 3: roll out to all 22K community members of Earn.Games

- Phase 4: official launch during Davos Jan 2022 in Switzerland

- Phase 5: get all my influencer friends (celebirites) to get their followers onboard

[11/16/22, 5:03:31 PM] Gary Teh: This corner case grey area just occurred to me after seeing the recent advances in graphics in AI generated videos especially after seeing the demo shared by @12063955455 by this started

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascalbornet_innovation-artificialintelligence-tech-activity-6998536422584434688-lSSP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios

Child porn and snuff films are all illegal right now in our society. 

But what if the actors are all AI generated characters that don’t exist in real life. 

Is generating such kinds of content where no real humans are involved still technically illegal?  🤔
[11/16/22, 5:04:29 PM] Gary Teh: It’s like this is going to happen in real life at some point isn’t it?? 

https://www.hbo.com/westworld
[11/16/22, 9:37:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: Someone should teach Meta how to do real graphics rather than their childlike minecraft type metaverse
[11/16/22, 10:25:23 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is they might just end up acquiring one of these startups to integrate their codebases into their own metaverse environment 🤔

[11/19/22, 12:27:10 AM] Gary Teh: When I look deeply at the whole DEFi and NFT space, majority of the projects that have no real proven utility already baked into their core tokenomics just end up with a dry liquidity pool overtime. 

Adding yielding and staking to draw in additional liquidity before there is proven utility is just masking and distracting the unsuspecting from the underlying foundational problem 

Any projects that don’t have proven utility, has baked in staking and yielding and a whole bunch of hype associated with it are based on my assessment just straight up Pump and Dump schemes 

In hindsight after observing this space for these past 11 months, and then critically reassessing the “advice” received from quite a few of these “investor” profile types I have spoken with, I conclude a lot of them are just misinformed and have given really bad “advice”

My sense is the next wave of web3 projects which will come about during this crypto winter will set the foundation for the next two decades of internet. They will however be built following strict product management methodologies. 

Basically the ecosystem is no longer receptive to the kind of bullshit we have observed these past 24 months

This from my perspective is very very healthy 🙂

[11/19/22, 12:50:05 AM] Gary Teh: Netflix and Zappos have gone through this process before as well in one form or another. 

Having less employees in a tech company is counter-intuitively better. Less processes, less communication overhead, less politics and simply more time freed up to get SH*T done.
[11/19/22, 12:58:07 AM] Gary Teh: During this round of physical survey of this ecosystem, my observation is that while layoffs at public big tech firms are dominating news headlines right now, a lot of the Pre-IPO companies with strong growth metrics are still very aggressively hiring. Some of them targeting to double their head counts over the next 12 months. 

My sense is this discrepancies I am observing is another one of those categorical "Fake" news.

[11/19/22, 1:31:57 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: People are clueless on how a corp works
[11/19/22, 2:01:52 AM] Gary Teh: I think @6598383264 did mentioned this principle before about the mining industry which could be generalized to all industries. 

practitioners within any industry generally access news about companies within their industries differently from folks not within those industries. The primary difference is because of the mental model they have about the space that non-practitioners are not familiar with. 

When you look back at historical Facebook data during the early days, every time they end up getting splashed across all news headlines because of some really bad PR, their DAU actually went up. Social Networks are anti-fragile. The more (positive/negative) PR there is the better. 

Right now twitter only has 150 million registered. All this bad PR by traditional press is actually free publicity for Twitter.
[11/19/22, 2:03:19 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: At the end of the day I think what we are witnessing is the maturity of an industry … next will be banks etc anything that has tech in it will get rid of 50% of their teams gonna be hard but great opportunity to build startups now
[11/19/22, 2:05:36 AM] Gary Teh: I think Web3 is a really juicy space right now in that regard with the crazy recent shake out. No need to compete against snake oil sales men who raised a lot of cash from ill-informed investors while driving up price of resources in the process.
[11/19/22, 2:06:25 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: No sure

[11/19/22, 2:30:17 AM] Gary Teh: @12063955455 one thing that still puzzles me right now is why MAS choose Polygon instead of Ethereum for their pilot. The only reason I could think of is because that decision was made before Ethereum merge happened.

[11/19/22, 2:30:51 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Transaction fees I guess
[11/19/22, 2:31:21 AM] Gary Teh: Ethereum moved over to POS, so theoretically the transaction fees should dropped. Or am I mistaken?
[11/19/22, 2:33:27 AM] Gary Teh: @12063955455  If Ethereum's gas fees has since dropped to levels similar to Polygon then Polygon might have lucked out managing to capture enough traction during the window

[11/19/22, 9:46:58 AM] Tres Garcia: I agree that a utility token should be just that, a way to use a platform to do something. The token should not be speculative, but rather a way to show interest in using the platform.
[11/19/22, 10:45:56 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Lol I hope I have descent advises :) I m usually focused on common sense it always work. If you can vaguely understand quantum physics books but not a crypto deck then it s not you who have an issue not getting it :)

[11/19/22, 10:59:13 AM] Tres Garcia: Nah... JPM's Onxy is built on ETH... So this project would just give them more breadth, and another feather in their cap of capabilities. Also  Polygon side chain goes with ETH like Peanut butter and banana sandwiches. So pretty delicious combo.

There are a whole bunch of actions you can choose from in our rubric for dealing with fake content circulating online

Or you can do what @14152032783 @16504369509  @491736386942  and @41799155602 are doing right now by replicating this same rubric/tokenomics system to mobilize the masses to address high impact social issues you notice happening in your field of interest 🙂🙏

[11/20/22, 5:14:52 PM] Gary Teh: Welcome to the gated portion of our network @447365523012 🤩

Bill Ackman just wrote a very long tweet explaining how proper application of Cryptocurrency is superb for creating two sided market places, a more economically inclusive and equitable network based business models 

https://twitter.com/billackman/status/1594456744851558402?s=46&t=2T-XDJnhoZhMVMy9tq__qw

I guess more and more people will be starting to wake up to this reality. 

Was chatting with @48606646246 this morning about the diffusion of technology and it is not our job as the innovators to convince the early majority to this space. 

But rather it is the job of early adopters like Bill Ackman and maybe even Elon Musk to onboard the early majority 

@14152032783 thanks for helping make the introduction today, our tokenomics model will be feature in a research thesis on token based crowd sourcing for social entrepreneurship 🙂🙏
[11/20/22, 5:15:49 PM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Thank you for adding me! 😊

[11/20/22, 5:23:14 PM] Gary Teh: I was explaining to Yousra over dinner the other day, proper application is perfect for creating multi side market places not just two sided ones. Hence what is most important at the upfront is defining clearly what a community’s values are. And then tokenizing real world actions that yield those desired values. 

In our case it’s basically actions that yield more Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity while detracting fake content circulation in our world 🤩
[11/20/22, 7:12:41 PM] Tim Fong: Some kind of theranos crypto’s that help with Covid maybe. Seems like a good tool for generating fake news :)
[11/20/22, 7:20:03 PM] Gary Teh: Theranos crypto? What is that 🤩
[11/20/22, 11:46:25 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I have finished updating this page to ensure the links to our chatrooms are only exposed to members who have more than 100 TDG token holdings in their wallet and on ledger 

https://TrueSight.me/dao

Need to update the SSL certificate on our servers before I can deploy the new code to production
[11/20/22, 11:47:57 PM] Gary Teh: Will expose that as something that DAO members can vote on too here along with governance token grants for other actions

https://truesight.me/dao/vote
[11/20/22, 11:49:10 PM] Gary Teh: I guess in 12minutes time we will officially shift over to quadratic voting in our network!! 🤩
[11/20/22, 11:54:30 PM] Gary Teh: Once this done, we will start rolling out cypher defense chrome extension to the broader community 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/chrome

The 100 governance token threshold will act as a filter to ensure only genuinely engaged and aligned members will qualify to join us in our network of chatrooms (with the exception of the do nothing society which serves as a get to know you landing pad )

That way quality of discussions about future directions of our network is maintained at a conducive level

@16506464893  Ray is starting to look into similar model to agrihood and ecoverse21. I proposed for him to reach out to you to further explore the model you have in mind

Meanwhile his wife Lan tapping on her experience on figuring out a framework quantify network exploitation like those of Amazon's. I would imagine that framework would help inform us on how to manage the extraction rates a DAO  charge for transactions passing through their networks without it going beyond the exploitation threshold while still keeping the network viable.

Second priority = task concerns

Lowest priority = machine/software concerns

We have started discussions on collaboration 

I see opportunity for us to farm out Edgar our resident AI to help support their project 

We are still discovering how deep our collaboration is going to be

At the most simple level, we might just end up charging their project our governance tokens for access to Edgar. So they will either need to earn it by contributing to our DAO or buy them  

Once things become clearer we will allow members to vote on how much governance tokens to charge projects per call to Edgar 🙂🙏

[11/23/22, 8:50:54 PM] Peter Peng: 😈
[11/23/22, 8:50:58 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[11/23/22, 8:51:30 PM] Gary Teh: Come to think of it, we are probably the first DAO collectively own and operate an actual AI 🤔🤯
[11/23/22, 8:52:25 PM] Peter Peng: All I see here is that Priscilla Huang is pulling all of the strings

[11/23/22, 9:07:50 PM] The real John Tan: And school’s still teaching kids how to memorise the periodic table
[11/23/22, 9:08:41 PM] Gary Teh: Total waste of time

Just wait for Elon Musk to get neuralink available and all the facts in the world will be just a thought away
[11/23/22, 9:08:50 PM] Peter Peng: Allows everyone to partake in the creator economy
[11/23/22, 9:09:25 PM] Peter Peng: Ignorance is bliss

[11/23/22, 9:10:13 PM] Peter Peng: Elon Musk has been reassigned to Twitter duty
[11/23/22, 9:11:34 PM] Peter Peng: Would be funny if they replaced him at Tesla and SpaceX
[11/23/22, 9:11:55 PM] Peter Peng: He just runs Twitter full time
[11/23/22, 9:20:00 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like it’s his dream job
[11/23/22, 9:21:37 PM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Ray (from JDFi) two nights that at some point a lot of things will end up getting automated by AI and robots

At that point we will all be forced one way or another to join the Do Nothing society. 

At that stage we will have no choice but to think deeply about what it really means to be human
[11/23/22, 9:22:28 PM] Gary Teh: I think that is going to be a very important subject for education in the very near future
[11/23/22, 9:23:22 PM] Peter Peng: Well, I feel like everyone’s new job will be building AI and robots and providing human data to the system. They will be paid in “AI Coins”
[11/23/22, 9:24:09 PM] Peter Peng: Imagine being paid to live
[11/23/22, 9:24:25 PM] Gary Teh: In that regard I think our governance tokens is one of the very first of those coin type
[11/23/22, 9:24:53 PM] Peter Peng: Or JETSON Coin
[11/23/22, 9:25:50 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! 🤩
‎[11/23/22, 9:26:48 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[11/23/22, 9:27:58 PM] Peter Peng: I think it would be along the same lines as content creators, but just for training AI
[11/23/22, 9:28:53 PM] Peter Peng: Make a few extra bucks, help train the AI. I wish there was something out there like that
[11/23/22, 9:30:28 PM] Peter Peng: Imagine being paid for your data, in Web3 this is possible
[11/23/22, 9:33:11 PM] Peter Peng: I might try to build a small app using quantum computing over this Thanksgiving break
[11/23/22, 9:33:21 PM] Peter Peng: Been meaning to mess with it
[11/23/22, 9:47:37 PM] Gary Teh: Let me know when you have an API to call 🤩
[11/23/22, 9:51:56 PM] Peter Peng: I have to figure out what to build with it, maybe hook it into my generative AI
[11/23/22, 9:52:06 PM] Peter Peng: For Se-ret
[11/23/22, 9:52:32 PM] Peter Peng: See what kind of quantum artwork can be generated

[11/23/22, 9:55:36 PM] Peter Peng: Or he is just an Elon fanboy
[11/23/22, 10:03:33 PM] Gary Teh: Am thinking through the architecture for this 

Right now those transactions will just be stored in our database 

There might come a certain point when it makes more sense to run this “custodial” model directly on polygon chain itself when expected monthly AWS database fees for storing those transactions outweighed the expected gas fees for just writing those transactions immediately on Polygon 

Will probably have to spend some time to dig into the costing side if this use case ever gains traction 🤔

[11/24/22, 10:21:59 AM] Anita Lamprecht: thank you for sharing yourself.
[11/24/22, 10:22:50 AM] Anita Lamprecht: pollination of knowledge ... this hits a weak spot.
[11/24/22, 10:26:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i was talking with my legal publishing friend/colleague about securing knowledge against theft by using blockchain technology (Tres and I discussed it in cypher defense). he has the same problem as Tres. it is not used by anyone.. pollination of knowledge.. that is the real problem. people are scared of sparking ideas in other people. thank you @14153000019 . that seems to be the missing thought.

[11/24/22, 11:37:57 AM] Dita: Happy Thanksgiving for everyone as well!!
[11/24/22, 12:08:37 PM] Gary Teh: Was just reading through some of the shared materials that @447492703707 sent over just now 

Here is what I feel the future AR  metaverse experience should be like 

The equipment should be no heavier than my current pair of glasses 

It should just be voice activated as I am already used to with Apple’s Siri

Siri should respond to me as she is already doing 

Instead of showing visual updates on my phone screen it should just show the visual updates in my glasses if there are any relevant visual outputs

The interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri what is this thing I am seeing in front of me right now”

“Gary it’s that time of the year when the US government reminds you to pay your taxes. Would you like to get it processed?”

“Yes please”

End of interaction 🤣
[11/24/22, 12:11:48 PM] Gary Teh: In the event of visual outputs, Siri should just detect where I am looking at and know what I am talking about

The interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri call you help me call Bob”

“Gary there are four Bobs who are you referring to?”

Siri proceeds to show the face of all four bobs on my glasses 

I look at the right Bob and say “that bob”

“Got it”

Ring tone heard. 

End of interaction
[11/24/22, 12:14:37 PM] Gary Teh: The Metaverse and AI should behave like that invisible friend we all imagined we had when we were growing up 

Kind of there but not in the way of my other day to day interactions with the environment 

The current experience just feels too clunky
[11/24/22, 12:14:44 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Or you interact with the blink of your eyes.
[11/24/22, 12:15:01 PM] Gary Teh: But I blink all the time 🤣
[11/24/22, 12:16:00 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Well then you need to train either yourself or your unvisible best friend. 😇
[11/24/22, 12:16:48 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Uncontrolled thinking could also be the downside of mind control devices …
[11/24/22, 12:18:17 PM] Gary Teh: Actually usually when speaking to someone and referring to something in the environment without using my hands I just do a slight node with my head in that direction 

I think that signal should be easy to pick up
[11/24/22, 12:18:33 PM] Gary Teh: Or even just looking at an item and then saying that one
[11/24/22, 12:19:07 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I think that’s how the mind controlling devices for gaming work.
[11/24/22, 12:19:34 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! Is it controlling your mind or your controlling it?
[11/24/22, 12:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: I just want my interact with the device to be as minimal as possible
[11/24/22, 12:20:31 PM] Anita Lamprecht: https://www.next-mind.com/
[11/24/22, 12:21:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: First you control it and then it will depend who owns your data.
[11/24/22, 12:32:17 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. If data ownership not centralized and dependency on platform is not too great then user experience will not likely to turn oppressive overtime
[11/24/22, 1:16:05 PM] Tres Garcia: I get too much grief when I talk to my invisible friends. 😏
[11/24/22, 1:17:22 PM] Tres Garcia: Taxes: “don’t be silly Gary, I’ve already calculated and paid your taxes for you, and you owe nothing & will not have to wait for a return because it’s a perfect $0.”
[11/24/22, 1:38:55 PM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Vigi, 

I am leaving tom night. So can’t join in. 
Only have a 3 days stay this trip, I am only in Dubai to get my residency proved and meet with Emmar who is
our partner in the crypto.
[11/24/22, 1:53:57 PM] Ved Sinha: Well said and hopefully enlightening for the readers!
[11/24/22, 1:57:26 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect UI/UX 🤩

No UX is the best UX. Don’t even need to think about it

So basically the interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri what is that”

“Never mind Gary. Already settled.”

“Great!”

End of interaction 🤣
[11/24/22, 2:45:40 PM] Gary Teh: Actually another even better UI/UX just occurred to me 🤔

This is how the interaction should go.

“Hey Siri..”

“Hey Gary, just like yesterday there is absolutely nothing to do today.” 

“Oh Got it” 

End of interaction 🤣

If you feel like getting a taste of the future right now help yourself to some…

[11/24/22, 3:36:13 PM] Brian -IOM: @14153000019 I think for a lot of people AR glasses will be about having a giant virtual cinema screen they can just plant on their head and watch! It’s a bit like how iPads were content consumsption devices before they were serious workstations.
[11/24/22, 5:42:27 PM] Gary Teh: I think it’s going to be a great experience 

I am just looking forward to the day i don’t  have to use my hands for typing 

I am lazy and just want to do nothing !  🤣

[11/25/22, 9:02:00 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: I love elon lol
[11/25/22, 9:02:36 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Invest wise would just focus on Bitcoin at the moment
[11/25/22, 9:02:48 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Staying away from any exchanges …
[11/25/22, 9:41:38 AM] Gary Teh: Lol! @41798496023 went on a rampage on centralized exchanges yesterday while we were chatting 

The sticking point is these exchanges are not behaving properly as exchanges should

You do not see Nasdaq or NYSE and behaving like VCs by investing consumer deposits into projects 

That is the job of investors not exchanges 🤔
[11/25/22, 9:53:04 AM] Peter Peng: With all the seriousness of what’s going on in the crypto markets, I think we might see a little bit of fun with meme coins

[11/25/22, 1:29:45 PM] Peter Peng: I mean, if it’s a stablecoin… fine.
[11/25/22, 1:30:00 PM] Peter Peng: But we already have too many of them
[11/25/22, 1:30:14 PM] Aga - DAOist: Tricky.. 🤔 yet I think that the more different sources we have, we can formulate our own opinions better.
[11/25/22, 1:30:35 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe just another option
[11/25/22, 1:31:26 PM] Aga - DAOist: Crypto vs CBDCs is like comparing chairs - a normal chair and an electric chair.. it not for our good at all..
[11/25/22, 1:33:07 PM] Peter Peng: I’m fine with a CBDC, but it needs to be on a public ledger or it defeats the whole purpose
[11/25/22, 1:37:45 PM] Aga - DAOist: Are you really fine with govenments being able to block your account, limit your transactions or decide what you spend your money for? Good luck. I don't comply with it.
[11/25/22, 1:42:19 PM] Peter Peng: I think there will be a need for Web3 banks 🏦

[11/25/22, 1:44:51 PM] Peter Peng: The CIA created Bitcoin
[11/25/22, 1:45:41 PM] Peter Peng: Satoshi Nakamoto translated stands for “central intelligence”
[11/25/22, 2:03:33 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: It’s a possibility but it doesn’t really stand when you consider the bashing of Bitcoin along with the fact that it gets around Avery border that had given the US control in the first place along with an alternative to swift to avoid sanctions
[11/25/22, 2:03:50 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: More likely it came from Aliens 👽 💫🚀
[11/25/22, 2:14:52 PM] Peter Peng: It’s how the government controls you, prior to Bitcoin was cash inside your mattress

[11/25/22, 3:56:12 PM] Gary Teh: What i am sensing is countries with larger GDPs with potential clout for having currencies international reserve currencies statuses will want to RnD and run their own blockchain where their own CBDC will be ran on. Much like what China and US are doing right now

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/runs-on-algorithmic-stablecoins-evidence-from-iron-titan-and-steel-20220602.html

Countries with too little economic clout will end up opting to establish their own CBdC on the chains of other countries chain or public chains

Nothing preventing us from “un-monetizing” a whole bunch of those activities that got monetized over the past 100 years 🤔

[11/26/22, 11:36:36 PM] Peter Peng: TrueSight
[11/26/22, 11:36:54 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[11/27/22, 12:28:46 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of drug dealing I was on a call with one of the leaders of the House of Balance this afternoon where I was helping restructure the operating budget to pull everything off the Fiat system to directly tap on the decentralized crowdsourcing mechanism 

Was also helping bake in Do Nothing spaces into the ecosystem to serves
 the purpose of energizing the do something spaces 

Strangely that conversation ended up getting labeled a very psychedelic experience by the leader after the hour long conversation was done 

Perhaps drug dealing can come in many forms 🤔
[11/27/22, 12:35:56 AM] Gary Teh: One very edgy concept that surfaced during the conversation was around tackling the problem of flying some of the project leaders in during the event

A lot of corporation literally have flier miles lying around unused due to the tons of flights booked for corporates executives in their companies 

So the idea is to allow them to donate their flight miles to the non-profit foundation that is already up and running in exchange for governance tokens plus the additional bonus of being able to write these off for tax credits 🤯
[11/27/22, 12:38:29 AM] Francois renet: bigger problem is travelers who do not use their miles. My buddy Kene is working on a concept to use rewards across multiple companies. in a time where people are struggling, using rewards from one store to another could be a way to survive
[11/27/22, 12:39:00 AM] Gary Teh: I am starting to get the sense that the deeper and more spiritually stirring the WHY the further out into the unknown the crowd sourcing approach could be pushed 🤔

[11/27/22, 12:49:06 AM] Gary Teh: It’s also going to be very fascinating to observe OffChain ecosystem as the tokenomics that me and @14152032783are RnDing unfolds within that space 

My sense is in the short run it’s going to bear semblance to the PitchDao network structure

In the long run, there is potential to bake in the Unconference protocol me @41799155602 and Zoran RnDed on when we were in Belgrad earlier this year
[11/27/22, 12:49:54 AM] Gary Teh: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tY4POL9JP72FRyF-GItbSX_knsZl-rA1j9kJ4FJ2o3Y/edit
[11/27/22, 12:59:06 AM] Gary Teh: One of the key challenges I observed in Belgrad when me and @41799155602 sat down in Belgrad to think through the topography of interlinked utility centric networks which @41799155602 loosely termed the Global DAO alliance was that there were not enough human energy available 

In hindsight it made more sense from an energy conservation stand point to just go about discovering communities, with DNAs already aligned with some of these utilities, that are also motivated to evolve in this direction, and then aiding them with their efforts at evolution

[11/27/22, 2:01:39 AM] Peter Peng: What does it inherently mean to “do nothing”? I feel like I’m always doing something but it has evolved over the years.
[11/27/22, 2:02:18 AM] Peter Peng: Society is redefining what “doing something” is…
[11/27/22, 2:03:03 AM] Peter Peng: We cannot do good for the world if we are enslaved
[11/27/22, 2:03:42 AM] Peter Peng: I think humanity collectively realized this when Covid19 hit
[11/27/22, 2:06:22 AM] Peter Peng: My belief that AI and automation can effectively help ease us out of doing jobs we don’t want to do
[11/27/22, 2:07:11 AM] Peter Peng: And move us toward action
[11/27/22, 2:08:50 AM] Peter Peng: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States
[11/27/22, 2:10:51 AM] Francois renet: but some of the jobs we don't want to do are a livelyhood for others. take Uber as an example, it helps hundreds of thousands of people live, but the ultimate goal is to replace the drivers with self driving cars which means tremendous lost of income. And we are nowhere near providing a universal paycheck to replace that income, most governments are over indebted already.
[11/27/22, 2:11:23 AM] Peter Peng: Can’t we tax the AI?
[11/27/22, 2:11:58 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not going to happen overnight
[11/27/22, 2:12:07 AM] Peter Peng: People will reassimilate
[11/27/22, 2:12:33 AM] Peter Peng: We also need help training the AI, so that will also be a job
[11/27/22, 2:12:46 AM] Peter Peng: For the new couple decades
[11/27/22, 2:12:50 AM] Peter Peng: Next
[11/27/22, 2:13:21 AM] Peter Peng: We also need help coding and building the AI and robots
[11/27/22, 2:14:55 AM] Peter Peng: Same arguments apply for when tractors 🚜 took over farming
[11/27/22, 2:15:28 AM] Francois renet: that's an interesting question. i got into a debate recently with someone about AI and monetization. they were using a humanoid to go to the house of parliament in england. to cut a long story short, i made the case that what we were creating was the slaves of the 21st century. happy to have that conversation offline so as to not overkill here. it is our need to humanize robots that is the biggest issue. we haven't really started yet, and there are already people fighting for the rights of machine. we are replacing one issue with another. and i am convinced that those who will win the AI race will just monetize it in a way to keep the gains to a minimum number of people
[11/27/22, 2:16:46 AM] Peter Peng: Robots don’t need rights, they are property
[11/27/22, 2:17:14 AM] Francois renet: and look at the state of agriculture today. let's use machines to alleviate the work that is back breaking, but let's not race to replace humans altogether. some people are not built to just work with their minds, and those are the ones who suffer from automatization, which at the end of the day is built to cut down on cost of labor and increase revenue. nothing to do with kindness for man. it's about profits
[11/27/22, 2:17:41 AM] Francois renet: not what the guy going to the house of parliament was saying! that's my point
[11/27/22, 2:18:28 AM] Francois renet: and he was using a humanoid that was a good looking girl to make the point. i argued that under the fake skin were two cameras, a CPU and robotic limbs, but that was not his belief
[11/27/22, 2:18:55 AM] Peter Peng: They still have a choice to grow their own food… most don’t. Most people adapt and assimilate when given the opportunity.
[11/27/22, 2:20:14 AM] Peter Peng: They don’t need look like sex bots…
[11/27/22, 2:21:33 AM] Francois renet: i agree. but we all know sex sells, and that's what they are using. it's a great distraction. i read a really cool article on how some cultures need robots to look mecanical, and others need them to look like people.
[11/27/22, 2:22:34 AM] Peter Peng: Either way, the robots should be protected by the owners.
[11/27/22, 2:22:39 AM] Peter Peng: It’s like a car
[11/27/22, 2:23:12 AM] Francois renet: it's humanizing them in any form that's dangerous. it affects perception. we are wired a certain way. in sf they did an experiment where they put a robot in a hotel after hours for room service. the first one looked mecanical and guests destroyed it. they replaced it with a human looking one, and no one touched it
[11/27/22, 2:23:21 AM] Peter Peng: If someone damages my car then it’s a crime
[11/27/22, 2:24:11 AM] Francois renet: but then we risk people fighting with people to protect their robots? and who will be able to afford a robot? it's building a new inequality layer, no?
[11/27/22, 2:24:53 AM] Peter Peng: I would more likely damage the human looking one
[11/27/22, 2:25:18 AM] Peter Peng: That’s a good thing, protect your robot
[11/27/22, 2:25:30 AM] Peter Peng: Like a car
[11/27/22, 2:25:41 AM] Peter Peng: Or any other asset you have
[11/27/22, 2:25:52 AM] Peter Peng: It’s self regulating
[11/27/22, 2:26:39 AM] Peter Peng: Basically… “Don’t be stupid”
[11/27/22, 2:27:16 AM] Francois renet: i rest my case 😂 because as humanity, history shows that we've been really smart!
[11/27/22, 2:28:57 AM] Peter Peng: I just see it being no different from owning a car or a dog. If someone harmed or damaged something that belongs to me they will receive repercussions. I don’t see it introducing more issues.

[11/27/22, 2:38:17 AM] Peter Peng: I think AI + Automation will be a luxury product as it rolls out first.
[11/27/22, 2:38:51 AM] Peter Peng: Kinda like how Tesla started off with the roadster for EVs
[11/27/22, 2:42:26 AM] Francois renet: not quite the same. robots will give some people an advantage that cars don't. cars consume. robots will produce. he who has the robot first will win.
[11/27/22, 2:43:20 AM] Peter Peng: That’s with any business that stays innovative
[11/27/22, 2:44:02 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure every business will be able to afford a robot
[11/27/22, 2:44:16 AM] Peter Peng: Or robots
[11/27/22, 2:44:39 AM] Peter Peng: Some may not want a robot
[11/27/22, 2:45:35 AM] Peter Peng: This is why I like the idea of cryptocurrencies, it allows different economies to form based on preferences/choice
[11/27/22, 2:45:57 AM] Peter Peng: For example, I can create a whole economy just for robots 🤖
[11/27/22, 2:48:40 AM] Peter Peng: I still believe that ultimately, AI and automation can do more good than harm
[11/27/22, 2:49:54 AM] Peter Peng: There will always be some sort of issues that arise but that’s just the nature of the beast 🦾

[11/27/22, 6:20:10 PM] Peter Peng: Or do we (humans) turn the robots into a species?

[11/27/22, 6:36:05 PM] Peter Peng: AI represents the Aliens
[11/27/22, 6:36:36 PM] Gary Teh: Jack Ma calls AI = Love

So maybe AI is god??
[11/27/22, 6:37:21 PM] Peter Peng: AI is definitely not love
[11/27/22, 6:38:11 PM] Peter Peng: It’s an advanced calculator
[11/27/22, 6:40:18 PM] Peter Peng: Or it could be that Aliens (robots) created Humans in a bio lab 🧫 sent bacteria to Earth 🌍 and now we are creating AI and Robots to visit our creator in order to close the cycle.
[11/27/22, 6:45:36 PM] Peter Peng: Life appeared on Earth 3.7 billion years ago, but due to light years this all be happening in near real time with our creator (Aliens or God).
[11/27/22, 6:46:08 PM] Peter Peng: Based on perception
[11/27/22, 6:48:26 PM] Peter Peng: So essentially we are creating God / Aliens and they are creating us at the same time.

[11/27/22, 10:10:05 PM] Gary Teh: That piece of rotten radish is going to stick for enternity! 🤣
[11/27/22, 10:13:30 PM] Peter Peng: The invisible hand is the shadow network
[11/27/22, 10:16:06 PM] Peter Peng: 👁️ it’s the all seeing eye
[11/27/22, 10:16:21 PM] Gary Teh: Is this your metamask address?

0x46Bc50C25DD18A044184a2Ed4F8e324365A6d298

Gonna make it a collaborate of the rotten radish collection
[11/27/22, 10:16:41 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah that’s one of them

[11/28/22, 12:19:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: 🤔📝prediction throw back just for fun. 

I still remember the times when people told me. Nah. Won’t happen….. u don’t understand. 

It’s easy to predict a Lower BTC price when something is crashing. But when it’s at it’s all time highs?

[11/28/22, 12:24:36 AM] Kelvin Chew: But it will rise again. Next year end or 2024. If it doesn’t break 70k meaningfully. That’s the end of BTC with the right shoulder.
[11/28/22, 2:05:18 AM] Peter Peng: Do you think Ethereum can flip BTC?
[11/28/22, 2:06:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: Why would u think that
[11/28/22, 2:06:59 AM] Peter Peng: Because of all the Dapps being built currently, it’s about to explode
[11/28/22, 2:07:55 AM] Peter Peng: Polygon and Ethereum
[11/28/22, 2:08:38 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just because something is build. Doesn’t guarantee it’s usage
[11/28/22, 2:09:08 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just like tons of NFTs are made. But who is talking about it now
[11/28/22, 2:09:30 AM] Peter Peng: Ones with real world utility
[11/28/22, 2:10:04 AM] Kelvin Chew: You are too idealistic
[11/28/22, 2:10:08 AM] Peter Peng: Forget stupid meme coins and ugly cartoons
[11/28/22, 2:10:48 AM] Peter Peng: How? Everything is starting to move to smart contracts. I believe my argument is very valid
[11/28/22, 2:11:08 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not even an argument, im just stating facts
[11/28/22, 2:11:57 AM] Kelvin Chew: Now. Who are the direct competitors to Dapps. Meaning established organisations with real world influence and tons of firepower
[11/28/22, 2:14:12 AM] Peter Peng: Corporations are starting to build Dapps, Google and Amazon are building blockchain hosting solutions. They are getting ready for it. So I don’t understand you argument
[11/28/22, 2:14:42 AM] Johnson Teh: I just secured the rights to buy freehold prime land with BTC from one of the Govt owned developers in Middle East….

Will this considered as common use of crypto?
[11/28/22, 2:14:45 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not Dapps vs. Corporations
[11/28/22, 2:15:35 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, but is it on a smart contract?
[11/28/22, 2:16:47 AM] Peter Peng: I believe the smart contracts make it verifiable that you own it on a universal ledger system meaning that if that government collapses you would still own that peice of land
[11/28/22, 2:17:06 AM] Peter Peng: This is where ETH comes in
[11/28/22, 2:18:27 AM] Anita Lamprecht: as lawyer the smart contract function is vital for a blockchain ecosystem.
[11/28/22, 2:18:53 AM] Anita Lamprecht: if you really own the physical land would depend if the legal system in question allows the entry in a blockchain as sufficient.
[11/28/22, 2:19:16 AM] Anita Lamprecht: usually it would need to be connected to a conventional land register
[11/28/22, 2:19:35 AM] Anita Lamprecht: depends on the country and how sophisticated their land registration system is.
[11/28/22, 2:19:58 AM] Anita Lamprecht: but.. if already digital. it could easily connected to a smart contract. without a lot of oracles missing it up :0)
[11/28/22, 2:20:15 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i know dubai is making massive steps in this direction.
[11/28/22, 2:20:27 AM] Anita Lamprecht: used to live and work in dxb a couple of years ago.
[11/28/22, 2:20:42 AM] Peter Peng: I can’t wait until Dapps start to take over… it’s a whole new ball game.
[11/28/22, 2:21:15 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, I hear that Dubai is doing some great things in the space.
[11/28/22, 2:21:31 AM] Anita Lamprecht: this is one topic i would really like to discuss with you. what do you need from the lawyers to make dapps successful ...
[11/28/22, 2:22:47 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Dxb... potentially yes. will be a question of religion and politics in which direction it is ultimately heading.
[11/28/22, 2:23:36 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i think lawyers could be a great support in setting up smart contracts, dapps... but OMG. most of them are sooo far away from the topic.
[11/28/22, 2:23:43 AM] Peter Peng: My firm has one based in DC working on regulation and legislation. In general, lawyers should work with blockchain developers to automate entire processes
[11/28/22, 2:24:26 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes. i am trying to serve as a bridge between tech and legal people. there is a communication challenge between the two sides. not understanding each other...
[11/28/22, 2:25:08 AM] Anita Lamprecht: this is why i am also very grateful to be in gary's groups. KYC :0))
[11/28/22, 2:26:22 AM] Peter Peng: My best advice is to keep it as simple as possible and design the system as if you were creating a “black market” transaction. It sounds terrible but it’s the best path forward.
[11/28/22, 2:27:58 AM] Peter Peng: A “black market” transaction is universal and self-governing so the system can be used in many nations.
[11/28/22, 2:29:09 AM] Peter Peng: Then it can be extensible from there
[11/28/22, 2:30:17 AM] Peter Peng: Through a side-chain
[11/28/22, 5:51:03 AM] Johnson Teh: I am not into tech 
I am only a deal maker fund mgt
😂 

So much appreciated whatever you guys share.

In my old brain, my fund will be owning the land, but the payment mode is in BTC. So the developer is merely collecting BTC instead of bank payment, and the land will be recorded  legally as ours with the land office
[11/28/22, 7:15:24 AM] Gary Teh: DApp are just a new way web applications are built. Software Developers are all starting to shift their development in that direction with all the recent concerns over privacy and data ownership rights 

Even our website can be considered a DApp since part of its functionality depends on you connecting your wallet to it to work
[11/28/22, 7:18:18 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I read most of the 200+ messages here lol and I can add a little something I think!

Doing nothing to me means breaking free of societal expectations and doing what you actually want. That could be creating art, dancing, writing, spending time with friends and family, enjoying nature… it could even be your job! As long as you choose it, you’re free.

Letting go of shame is a big part of doing nothing, because your mind also becomes quieter and more peaceful. Many cultures around the world have already mastered this I think and it’s really the western perspective that pushes productivity on us all!

Our worth =/= how productive we are. 

I spend all my days doing nothing atm (reading, gym, yoga, teaching, editing photos…)

After mastering doing nothing, I think the next step is responsibility/helping people. That’s where fulfilment comes from for most people I think. Once you have a built a life where you can do nothing, what elevates it to a fulfilling life is one where you choose to spend your time helping people/having a responsibility - like teaching, taking care of children, having a purposeful job, taking care of anyone really 🤷‍♀️

Thoughts??
[11/28/22, 7:23:28 AM] Gary Teh: Very nicely framed! 🤩

The way you described it reminds me of the writings of the Zen abbot in the book “Tiger’ Cave” 

The beginning of the journey is directed towards nothing, till the extend reality stops and water becomes still like mirror. 

Then beyond the satori moment when the mirror shatters, everything comes back and fills the universe 🤯
[11/28/22, 7:28:03 AM] Gary Teh: I remember when I was studying the commercial law module back in colleague there is this legal concept called the “indication of interest” where a commercial contract is said to be in effect so long ad a potential buyer makes a down payment (even just USD1) 

With COVID, docusign has became a commonly accepted form of  notarization. 

What would be interesting would be to combine docusign and the addresses of a signed transaction which references the onchain address to the “indication of interest”

I believe this would be a good bridge between both worlds at a very entry level 🤩
[11/28/22, 7:39:40 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Gonna look up this book!

[11/28/22, 8:42:06 AM] Peter Peng: Not sure if the army can stop billions of people
[11/28/22, 8:42:25 AM] Peter Peng: Hopefully it won’t come to that
[11/28/22, 8:42:41 AM] Francois renet: it's all about what you are willing to give up for freedom. look at Iran and the uprising

[11/28/22, 8:45:24 AM] Francois renet: i think it's more of a scare tactic to the west as to supply chain dependency but it's backfiring
[11/28/22, 8:46:08 AM] Peter Peng: I think they were more dependent on the West’s consumerism
[11/28/22, 8:49:32 AM] Francois renet: for now it's a typical supply and demand scenario. The west is willing to pay more to get what we need. A month before christmas? lockdown? coincidence i think not!
[11/28/22, 8:50:10 AM] Francois renet: remember all the issues Amazon had last year to deliver on time for christmas. it cost them millions. they won't do it this year. prices be going up!
[11/28/22, 8:53:34 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t feel like many Christmas gifts will be purchased this year
[11/28/22, 8:55:56 AM] Francois renet: maybe in the US. In Germany i just heard a report that people were making christmas count this year
[11/28/22, 8:56:05 AM] Gary Teh: And maybe it’s a good thing 

Bulk of the gifts end up in the landfills within 5 years anyways 🤔🤣
[11/28/22, 8:56:46 AM] Peter Peng: Give crypto for Christmas 🎄 it’s on sale :)

[11/28/22, 9:11:57 AM] Gary Teh: I think our rotten radish collection is highly differentiated compared to other NFT collections out there 

While everyone is trying to create beautiful and collectible artwork in hope of gathering followers and minters we just went in the total opposite direction with our rotten radish by being trashy beyond and hopes of redemption 🤣

[11/28/22, 11:11:25 AM] Gary Teh: Folks by the way, Aleksa is looking to start a podcast that focuses on DAOs and education

[11/28/22, 11:52:59 AM] Francois renet: Oh you're looking for guests on the podcast, i thought Aleksa needed infrastructure help!
[11/28/22, 11:53:21 AM] Aléksa: I am just getting started, so need help to get out there. 😀 
I have several episodes recorded, and few more lined up. 

main thing is getting to the wider audience
[11/28/22, 11:54:03 AM] Aléksa: I need infrastructure help! 1on1 episodes, I have until Feb i think, panels are planned out 
however, getting out is the tricky part 😀
[11/28/22, 11:55:06 AM] Francois renet: what platforms are you on?
[11/28/22, 11:55:45 AM] Aléksa: right now, only on Yt  - hoping to push this week on other platfroms as the website is up
[11/28/22, 11:58:21 AM] Francois renet: i can connect you with Stewart. https://www.linkedin.com/in/stewartrogers/. One of the most connected guys i have ever met in this space.
[11/28/22, 12:00:04 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 you might also want to have @17755088150 on the podcast at some point as well. 

She does alot of research into how Psychedelics can be combined with Web3 to uplift humanity. 🤩
[11/28/22, 12:00:47 PM] Aléksa: I will have some episodes focusing on different use cases, so that's interesting for sure!

[11/28/22, 12:13:41 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Ah I see 😅
[11/28/22, 12:20:36 PM] Aléksa: that would be great, thank you. I followed him on Link

[11/28/22, 5:45:14 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like China made a huge misstep with their Zero COViD policy 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vPRDLqggwQU

All the publicity of football players running around without a mask while both neighbors Japan and South Korea no longer enforcing lock down policy is not helping 

My sense is Xi’s recent third term (which frames him as the supreme leader) which runs contrary to Deng’s maximum two term policy is also not helping much 

I am curious see what happens as the World Cup runs it course
[11/28/22, 5:47:52 PM] Peter Peng: It doesn’t look that bad compared to when Covid19 initially started
[11/28/22, 5:51:20 PM] Johnson Teh: There will be nothing…

No change but maybe a gradual removal of certain lock down across 1st tier cities and villages will continued to be locked down.

At least till Mar 2023
[11/28/22, 5:55:46 PM] Johnson Teh: Their next step is to reopen cities but still limit access to Villages. So that these area won’t faced with a India death rate 

To the Chinese, 

Being alive is more important than any thing else.

As of now, all these So call revolutions march are done by youngest who have yet formed their “social esteem”… wait till they get married and bear a mortgage, then they will just go home and continue to follow the rules. 

Talk is cheap, action counts 
In this aspect, Chinese leader esp Mr Xi has lots of action packed to handle these kids 😂 

So no change of any is my bet 😜

[11/28/22, 6:04:07 PM] Peter Peng: I think it will become more reformed and progressive
[11/28/22, 6:17:25 PM] Johnson Teh: Na… no way. I know the Chinese inside out 😂 

Chinese culture is a master of staying alive, thus change only takes when an external force imposed on their survivorship 

Of cos now is never about the Chinese but that of C
[11/28/22, 6:18:41 PM] Johnson Teh: So don’t bet your money on a reform. 
Rather bet on a conflicting era. 
Buy land buy weapon maker and food and BTC
[11/28/22, 6:36:34 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Reminds me of my EatAndDieTrying campaign all over Northern America 🤣
[11/28/22, 6:40:33 PM] Peter Peng: My perception is that they have reformed and modernized a lot over the years, but the people may be looking for a change.
[11/28/22, 6:41:19 PM] Gary Teh: They watched too much TikTok. Xi needs to learn how to entertain on TikTok to win popular points 🤣
[11/28/22, 6:42:12 PM] Peter Peng: Less dictator, more influencer
[11/28/22, 6:42:22 PM] Peter Peng: I love it 😍

[11/28/22, 11:23:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: Let me provide u an interesting fact of tiktok China. Which is by the China company bytedance
[11/28/22, 11:23:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tiktok releases different content in China
[11/28/22, 11:23:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: Compared to the usa intentionally.
[11/28/22, 11:24:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: In usa. Most of the time. People are seen to do stupid things. Algorithms feed that intentionally (that’s the conspiracy theory)
[11/28/22, 11:25:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: But in China. All these are censored. People see on tiktok people doing “healthy activities”

Exercise clips. People with good social behavior. Good charitable acts. Knowledge driven clips. People treating people kindly. Animals. And those kind
[11/28/22, 11:26:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: The conspiracy theory is this. Let the new generation of westerners be bombarded with stupid clips and erode their minds. Let them start eating detergents and waste their lives away doing idiotic things
[11/28/22, 11:26:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: Whilst the young generation of China are fed constantly with self improvement and striving for development.
[11/28/22, 11:27:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: Social warfare
[11/28/22, 11:27:32 PM] Francois renet: i read this about Tik Tok. and agree with you 100%. Let's try and dumb westerners with stupid content.
[11/28/22, 11:29:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: Will never happen. Censorship is an entire department of tens of thousands of people actively deleting things.

[11/29/22, 12:17:01 AM] Peter Peng: Why?
[11/29/22, 12:19:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: Cos people in China saw the audience without masks and went “wtf are we doing here with masks and lockdown”
[11/29/22, 12:19:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: It was censored within a few hours
[11/29/22, 12:19:55 AM] Kelvin Chew: And all social media wiped clean
[11/29/22, 12:20:33 AM] Peter Peng: Covid is bullshit
[11/29/22, 12:20:48 AM] Peter Peng: It’s just about control
[11/29/22, 12:21:49 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is missused. Instead of giving people the simple remedies to get out of it
[11/29/22, 12:23:43 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: And the game is to play with fear. Our fear. And what is the easiest one, that most of us concern? Dying. And if this doesn’t work: killing someone.
[11/29/22, 12:23:49 AM] Peter Peng: It’s almost a beautiful thing to see the protests in China
[11/29/22, 12:24:41 AM] Peter Peng: Should line up all the politicians and kill them in China
[11/29/22, 12:24:52 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yes. No mather how manipulated a society is (and we are big time), there is light.
[11/29/22, 12:24:55 AM] Peter Peng: Execute them all
[11/29/22, 12:26:50 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: If they all took the shoots, they are doing it by themselves. Excuse my cynicism.
[11/29/22, 12:27:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: So ur solution is nazi?
[11/29/22, 12:27:05 AM] Peter Peng: I’m still a bit pissed the USA and rest of the world had to deal with this Covid19
[11/29/22, 12:27:27 AM] Kelvin Chew: And what makes u think it isn’t from usa.
[11/29/22, 12:27:35 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: The world did not really have to deal with COVID-19 they dealt with leader ship
[11/29/22, 12:27:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: In 2019. There was multiple deaths in usa due to lung problems from “vaping”
[11/29/22, 12:27:51 AM] Kelvin Chew: Remember that?
[11/29/22, 12:27:59 AM] Peter Peng: Worse
[11/29/22, 12:28:07 AM] Peter Peng: 😈
[11/29/22, 12:28:18 AM] Kelvin Chew: And scientific studies have found covid existed in rural areas in usa in 2019
[11/29/22, 12:28:31 AM] Kelvin Chew: So how did it get there from wuhan China
[11/29/22, 12:29:01 AM] Peter Peng: It was engineered in a lab
[11/29/22, 12:29:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: And usa owns the most labs in the world
[11/29/22, 12:29:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: And it’s china’s fault. Sounds like a very trump statement
[11/29/22, 12:29:53 AM] Peter Peng: There is a book written in the 1980’s called “The Eyes of Darkness” it talks about a virus called Wuhan400
[11/29/22, 12:30:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. Sure.
[11/29/22, 12:30:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: My point is. Nobody knows where this virus originated from. So we shouldn’t be pointing figures
[11/29/22, 12:30:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: Fingers*
[11/29/22, 12:30:52 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It doesn’t really matter where it came from.

[11/29/22, 12:31:22 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It does matter how we deal with it. And a lot of damage has been caused just because of the way how we do it.
[11/29/22, 12:31:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Agreement there
[11/29/22, 12:32:41 AM] Peter Peng: Either way, it’s funny to see American Anarchy in China 🇨🇳
[11/29/22, 12:32:44 AM] Peter Peng: 😂
[11/29/22, 12:33:27 AM] Kelvin Chew: “Thriller writer” is from where?

An American writer…

So the mastermind of a fictional story, is an American.
[11/29/22, 12:33:42 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah
[11/29/22, 12:33:57 AM] Kelvin Chew: So it’s an American plot that came real
[11/29/22, 12:34:22 AM] Peter Peng: It’s funny how the Chinese government tried to lock everyone inside like animals
[11/29/22, 12:34:46 AM] Peter Peng: Did they think that would work?
[11/29/22, 12:35:00 AM] Kelvin Chew: And u find such suffering funny?
[11/29/22, 12:35:16 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: nature is a fantastic thing, and it is the reason why I like DAOs. it is about how it grows, and how everything gets into balance. It might take more, but I believe it is happening everywhere. Concerning the virus, you can boost your immune system with vitamin D unfortunately, I don’t have the meta-study information in English.
[11/29/22, 12:35:35 AM] Peter Peng: No, how they dealt with it was compared to the rest of the world
[11/29/22, 12:36:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: And killing more people is the ideas u have in ur head?
[11/29/22, 12:36:11 AM] Peter Peng: They are stupid
[11/29/22, 12:36:32 AM] Peter Peng: The politicians
[11/29/22, 12:36:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: My friend. U have a darkness within u
[11/29/22, 12:36:43 AM] Peter Peng: Yes
[11/29/22, 12:37:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: I rest my case
[11/29/22, 12:37:58 AM] Peter Peng: That was the name of the book
[11/29/22, 12:38:06 AM] Peter Peng: Eyes of Darkness
[11/29/22, 12:38:34 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: We all have responsibilities. Also, if we’re suffering, this is a very inconvenient, but it is what it is all about. it is not about blaming and not about suffering, it is about taking this responsibility. Everyone of us.
[11/29/22, 12:39:35 AM] Peter Peng: To be fair, I do believe the Chinese government released Covid19 onto the world which is why the karma is happening.
[11/29/22, 12:40:04 AM] Peter Peng: What goes around comes around 10x, the universe doesn’t play around
[11/29/22, 12:41:08 AM] Peter Peng: Chinese control vs. American Anarchy
[11/29/22, 12:42:04 AM] Peter Peng: Now we are seeing American Control and Chinese Anarchy

[11/29/22, 12:44:05 AM] Kelvin Chew: Keep telling urself that
[11/29/22, 12:44:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: New Zealand has a lot of freedom. I don’t see them bombing anyone
[11/29/22, 12:45:01 AM] Peter Peng: Because they would lose lol
[11/29/22, 12:45:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: Oh. So the reason isn’t about freedom. It’s about supremacy
[11/29/22, 12:46:05 AM] Peter Peng: Well I’m the case of China it looks like Civil War

Of China. Acknowledge the wrongs of usa too
[11/29/22, 12:50:37 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: War is never a solution. If we go to war, other interests are playing. This is what makes the us not much appreciated in the rest of the world.
[11/29/22, 12:50:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: Fairness is what I ask for
[11/29/22, 12:50:51 AM] Kelvin Chew: And I am against all forms of war

[11/29/22, 12:51:25 AM] Peter Peng: After Covid19 we became really bad

[11/29/22, 12:53:27 AM] Peter Peng: Rightfully so

[11/29/22, 1:12:51 AM] Peter Peng: The USA got fucked up, which is why we no longer give a fuck
[11/29/22, 1:13:00 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: it is really though truth, but I spoke to an astrophysics. US in space is behaving like on earth leaving trash everywhere and making their own rules not following international agreements.
[11/29/22, 1:14:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: But again… it is everyone else at fault. It cannot ever be them. It is the world that didn’t follow their trash leaving guidelines and stayed out of the way
[11/29/22, 1:15:01 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Of course. Because they were first and they are bigger so everyone else shut up.
[11/29/22, 1:15:12 AM] Peter Peng: The USA has basically become lawless… I kind of love it… it feels more dangerous but we are free from government control.
[11/29/22, 1:15:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: Space belongs to usa. Nobody should be there in the first place. So if nobody else should be there. Then they can do whatever they want.
[11/29/22, 1:15:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: And hence. No trash problems
[11/29/22, 1:15:58 AM] Peter Peng: The USA represents all nations

[11/29/22, 1:16:31 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: honestly, the space trash problem with it as hard. After the speech of the astrophysics, I was quite, 
Let’s say I needed a drink.
[11/29/22, 1:16:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: Being there first didn’t mean anything to them
[11/29/22, 1:16:53 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Misspelling. The space trash thing is going to hit us hard.
[11/29/22, 1:20:39 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: everyone in space is usually dealing with trash, either making its points towards earth so it will burn or giving it a spin to head for infinity. every piece of trash is being recorded and tracked if you lose your tools and space, they see it here in the University of Bern. Musk in Branson unfortunately are not following this record. Behaving like cowboys. (what we think of Cowboys in Europe.)

[11/29/22, 8:47:15 AM] Gary Teh: And this is how Facebook begins rolling out NFTs. 🤔

They are not even going to call it that 🤣
[11/29/22, 8:56:47 AM] Gary Teh: Actually it really boils down to food supplies 

While there are lots of food in New Zealand. It’s very costly to sail across the ocean to invade New Zealand. The calories you spend far outweighs the calories you gain from the invasion as well as the portability of gaining access to the calories due to protection by the locals 

From New Zealander perspective there are more than enough calories for their own needs and they don’t really bother producing too much new humans (making babies) anyway. So why bother expending unnecessary calories to go off somewhere else to acquire more calories 🤔

The problem with China is they are not producing enough food internally to feed their local folks so they are forced to source for food overseas 

The problem in the US is since they are producing way more than enough food to feed themselves, they are paranoid others folks would come invade to steal their food so to preempt that they go about messing with other folks. 🤣

Speaking off food. Seems like it’s time for breakfast 🤤🤣
[11/29/22, 9:10:08 AM] Gary Teh: Or another way to do it is to figure out how to scavenge all these trash as materials for building a new colony in space… 🤔

Been chatting with Allison about doing the same with all the plastic floating around in the ocean. Compact them into a floating platform used for growing giant edible kelps beneath them. These kelps will nurture healthy population of fish stocks. What was trash is now a very wonderful source of food supply 🤤🤣

[11/29/22, 9:22:37 AM] Gary Teh: I did come across a few startups here in the bay that are exploring how to do manufacturing in deep space. Mainly through 3D printing technology 

If there was a way to convert all the trash out there in space to inputs for these 3D machines that would be super wonderful 

Transporting raw materials into space is very expensive still
[11/29/22, 9:24:22 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yes it is important to find ways to use our trash, but better not to create new ones from the beginning. Always thinking of the end of the lifecycle. concerning the metal in the space, we do already have so many satellites and reflecting materials in the orbit, that dawn eventually will be taking place later. Wondering what effect this is going to have to the climate change. Better get the colony’s ready 😅
[11/29/22, 9:57:09 AM] Gary Teh: This irony occurred to me a few times after choosing to live out of the car to RnD a life style blueprint that conforms to the ethos of the circular economy 

The living out of the car RnD process seems to unintentionally send the signal of having a lag (need) of stuff (poor). 

This signal attracts a lot of free stuff from the environment (donations)

Since as part of the RnD process, I need to take into account the full life cycle of every single item that gets introduced into the car’s limited space, I end up spending alot of time figuring out how to dispose of in an environmentally responsible manner all the non-biodegradable stuff that comes my way on a regular basis.

[11/29/22, 10:17:27 AM] Gary Teh: And that is hubris 🤔
[11/29/22, 10:22:25 AM] Gary Teh: I ever came across literature that describes the root cause of a lot of our modern day social problems got introduced when (hierarchy based) monotheistic (single supreme being at the top and humans as Shepards/guardians of the rest of the world ) based philosophy was introduced into our civilization 

When you look back before the monotheistic periods, there is much similarities between paganism based traditions and eastern philosophy. 

The common theme being man is very much a part of the environment and natural systems are by nature circular.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup

Allison reminded me yesterday, I am not really bringing anything new to the table. 

Technically I am just looking far back in history and reintroducing once popular ideas that have already been forgotten 🤔🤣
[11/29/22, 12:17:31 PM] Gary Teh: And even this movement of reintroducing once popular idea that have now been forgotten, has happened before. And there is a term for that too 🤔

[11/29/22, 12:29:44 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: they did not know that the apple may be eaten and digested, but it cannot be multiplied at will without disturbing the equilibrium. And also that leather from apples becomes micro plastic and so persists as a remnant on the planet, instead of becoming nutrient. so somehow they have built in the story, the shame in the completely wrong place. 😂

Of course that never came to be but it planted a seed in the population. Good old predictive programming 🙄

[11/29/22, 7:45:33 PM] Anupa/diya: Just going to copy paste my response . 

The replication of accounts is so easily carried out on Instagram.  Names are duplicated with slight variations, content can be screenshot and re typed. 

Tarot community, motivation al speakers or even Influenvers. Celebrities who have fan pages duplicated on their name is an advantage but smaller scale accounts is disheartening

Didn’t realize @14152032783 also have the vision of circumnavigating the world on a sailboat 🤣

I shared with him this decentralized idea I drafted up with Felix back in May after we finished Davos 

Imagine collectively acquiring a sailboat and then circumnavigating that boat around the world in a relay style marathon. 

At each port supporters will hop and hop off 

A lot of sailor folks I spoke to have this fantasy of circumnavigating around the world but most either can’t find the time or money to do so

This is a great opportunity to live out part of the experience IRL while experiencing the rest of the journey vicariously through other members of the community who happen to be on that boat drifting in the middle of nowhere  🤣

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1YuCAvTxyYx2vyWI5ZBbl4UE0Bcj2qshT/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

I even documented the full sail route in there

*3 crypto leaders die mysteriously in one month*

Has Death come early as governments grow nervous about decentralized digital assets?

https://americasfrontlinenews.com/post/3-crypto-leaders-die-mysteriously-in-one-month

November has proved ill-boding for figures in the cryptocurrency industry as the heads of three major crypto companies have reportedly died mysteriously within a month of each other. 

The fatalities come amid a titanic scandal involving FTX Founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, a Democratic Party megadonor who defrauded hundreds of thousands of users, severely hobbling the crypto industry. 

Libertex Founder and President Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash over the weekend in Villefranche-sur-Mer near the French-Italian border. 

The 53-year-old and his 35-year-old veteran pilot were killed instantly when the Airbus H130 suddenly went down. 

Another passenger had reportedly been scheduled to fly with Taran but canceled at the last minute. 

“It is with great sadness that Libertex Group confirms the death of its co-founder and Chairman of Board of Directors, Vyacheslav Taran, after a helicopter crash that took place en route to Monaco on Friday, 25 November 2022,” Libertex announced in a statement. 

Last week, Amber Group Co-Founder Tiantian Kullander, 30, was found dead in his sleep, cause of death unknown.  

"[Tiantian] was a devoted husband, a loving father and a fierce friend," the Hong Kong-based digital asset company announced in a statement. 

"His passing is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. He is survived by his wife and their beloved son. We kindly request that you respect their privacy during this difficult time." 

On October 28, young crypto pioneer Nikolai Mushegian, whose goal was to “end global banking corruption”, was found dead on a Puerto Rico beach just hours after tweeting that the CIA and Mossad were going to kill him. 

“CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and Caribbean islands,” wrote Mushegian at 4:57 a.m. 

“They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex [girlfriend] who was a spy. They will torture me to death.” 

Mushegian was “an early developer of Maker DAO, known as the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. He was also a key architect of the stablecoin system — currencies without government backing,” reported the New York Post. 

The deaths, along with the FTX scandal, come as some governments wage war against decentralized digital assets and finance which remain out of their reach. 

China has already banned cryptocurrency and the Biden administration has been open about its attempts to regulate the industry as it works to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) controlled by the state.

- reached out to collaborate on writing a book

[11/30/22, 7:38:51 PM] Gary Teh: If the book ever gets manifested it will probably end up being an anthology 

Likely it will contain a collection of patterns that have been observed to be recurring in various domains that could be easily cross pollinated to other domains to effectively yield actionable insights 

I am sensing it might end up  being a modern day variant of to the Dao De Jing 道德经

Just for entertainment purpose it should probably be titled The way of the DAO 🤣
[11/30/22, 7:46:12 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/30/22, 7:46:46 PM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps for marketing branding purposes we could title it The Way of TrueSight DAO 🤔

As suggested by @6594897484 Folks who have read the book and feel the contents reasonate with them could then self invite to our discussion channels to further aid in the evolution of our methodology 🤷‍♂️

Even if they don’t, the contents should be useful for application within whatever domain they are working on
[11/30/22, 7:47:21 PM] Tres Garcia: Way of the DAO has my vote
[11/30/22, 7:48:25 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. In the spirit of the ethos which Burning Man is based on, this will be our gift to the web3 ecosystem 🙂🙏

Would be a very exciting experiment for sure 🤩

[11/30/22, 10:49:21 PM] Anita Lamprecht: in spring i had a chat with someone from meta in zurich. he told me that they are hiring like crazy but there is no room for the people.... this raises the question: were these people hired to stay? or just as a marketing tool to show «yes. we are creating jobs in europe. 10.000 new jobs». that's what representatives of meta said last year around the october announcement. was it really unforeseeable that there will be a recession ? what a great excuse to fire.
[11/30/22, 10:50:46 PM] Anita Lamprecht: will you reveal your insights and learning to us? the tower and the devil both reversed. 😇
[11/30/22, 10:50:48 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is since everybody was hiring like crazy, they all went into FOMO mode concerned all the talents would be sucked up by competing firms leaving them in the dust with talent shortage
[11/30/22, 10:51:12 PM] Anita Lamprecht: makes sense.
[11/30/22, 10:53:37 PM] Anita Lamprecht: consuming art. 😉

[11/30/22, 11:06:19 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I like to interpret it from the point of storytelling/filmmaking: everything needs to count. every detail, even the missing ones convey a message. to me the snake represents the rising of kundalini an a human. the devil head represents a fallen angel. how can an angel fall? this brings in the missing part in the picture. the community is missing that would catch the falling angel. decision between good and bad (although I think bad might be the wrong term ... ) seem to be made alone or maybe just between 2 people. the kundalini happened too fast, unprepared and without a safety net that you would need. knowledge itself is neither good nor bad.  but it makes a difference how and with whom you share it. ...
[11/30/22, 11:07:53 PM] Anita Lamprecht: interesting ... the combination of your post about the Garden of Eden and your tarot reading.
[11/30/22, 11:10:43 PM] Anita Lamprecht: life becomes very interesting when strangers start catching you

[11/30/22, 11:17:06 PM] Anita Lamprecht: 🤣🤣 yes a few rules a necessary. we are only humans afterall. 😆
[11/30/22, 11:20:26 PM] Gary Teh: I think even the rubric has subjectivity inherently baked in when you take into consideration the wordings 

https://TrueSight.me/rubric

I believe the sooner I finish this form and allow members to adjust the governance token grants based on their perspective of the line items on the rubric the better it is 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/vote 

Collectively weighted subjectivity is at the end of the day more balanced than the subjectivity of a few individuals
[11/30/22, 11:25:17 PM] Gary Teh: Other similar scenarios I can think of 

A judge interpreting a law in a new way that other judges start adopting for future cases

A pastor interpreting a passage in the Bible in a new way. 

Condescend used to be interpreted in a positive light during the feudal age but has a negative connotation in this day and age 

The words might be the same but it’s interpretation changes over time as the civilization evolves
[11/30/22, 11:26:14 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Liquid legal! Lawyers should be the intermediaries / translators between the rules made and real needs.
[11/30/22, 11:26:28 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! 🤩
[11/30/22, 11:27:02 PM] Anita Lamprecht: .. to me AI is a great mirror and aid.
[11/30/22, 11:27:50 PM] Gary Teh: That is true AI is basically a deductive process while most of life is an inductive process
[11/30/22, 11:28:31 PM] Gary Teh: So I would use AI to save time but would still rely on human intuition for fundamental breakthroughs
[11/30/22, 11:28:40 PM] Anita Lamprecht: i will think about it. ... virtual reality helps me (personally) to reveal the different layers of my humanity.

[11/30/22, 11:36:50 PM] Anita Lamprecht: the problem with lawyers is that many are unwell. my think tank made a survey. the results are shocking (suicide rate as well as mental health problems)... so I am constantly wondering... how can people catch, safeguard and develop law for the best of humanity ..if they are not functioning as humans anymore? the mind is simply closed. I see it in my metaverse lectures.
[11/30/22, 11:37:25 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, you need to unlearn everything in Web2 before moving into Web3 z the conventions are wayyyyyyy different.
[11/30/22, 11:38:14 PM] Gary Teh: That is disturbing. Any idea what is the root cause?
[11/30/22, 11:38:18 PM] Peter Peng: It’s like riding a unicycle vs. bicycle

[11/30/22, 11:49:37 PM] Gary Teh: I think giving people equal access rights to food after fully automating food production might fundamentally help 

That would remove of one of the fundamental human condition’s needs for the use money

[12/1/22, 1:02:58 AM] Peter Peng: AI needs a periodic table of algorithms
[12/1/22, 1:03:30 AM] Peter Peng: So it can then understand how it was composed
[12/1/22, 1:04:41 AM] Francois renet: i was re-thinking the entire publishing space in terms of digitalization and distribution this morning. I think we need to stop thinking web2/3/5000 and focus on finding solutions that we do not try and put in a box. right now we are looking at web version and trying to back models into it - that's how you end up wih Hyundai advertising a block version of their car on Roblox + stupid! we need to analyze issues, think solutions, then look at how to best implement. what do you think?
[12/1/22, 1:05:30 AM] Francois renet: 100% correct. most people use the term AI loosely as all they often do is cross reference tables. there is no AI in that whatsoever!
[12/1/22, 1:12:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i think publishing will be much more exciting once people adopt the new tools available... imagine immersing in e.g. the interview with gary instead of «just» reading it..  (although i love the magazine. very very nice aesthetics).
[12/1/22, 1:14:20 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i was attending a concert by hans zimmer lately. and the way how he interacted with the audience was already great. just a video, but in a very personal way... hollywood style. talking to the audience and making us feel as if he was with us.
[12/1/22, 1:14:45 AM] Anita Lamprecht: now imagine VR, AR,.... if you ever you want to start a project.. please let me be part of it.

[12/1/22, 1:16:12 AM] Francois renet: i agree! what i was most interested in was the retail aspect of it, like buying magazines at the airport from example. I'm not a scary cat at all, but these days i don't like to pick up a magazine at a stand because i don't know who touched it before for example, but it goes further than that!

[12/1/22, 1:23:54 AM] Francois renet: here is the conversation. i got really peeved off because instead of encouraging engagement and change within the company, she encourages individualism. I understand where she is coming from, but you don't make the world or the workplace a better one with this kind of attitude. again, she didn't want to be challenged, but rather wanted to sound smart.
[12/1/22, 1:24:41 AM] Anita Lamprecht: he feels insulted by your age.
[12/1/22, 1:25:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I learnt about empathy yesterday... the main learning: the wording reveals the feeling. if it is about feelings... no intellectual argument will work anymore.
[12/1/22, 1:26:40 AM] Anita Lamprecht: you don't fit into his «value» system :0)
[12/1/22, 1:27:20 AM] Peter Peng: She probably does a shitty job in her HR position at work and no one likes her, because if she did someone would tell her she’s doing an awesome job and she doesn’t need to be on LinkedIn 😂
[12/1/22, 1:27:36 AM] Peter Peng: Fishing for praise
[12/1/22, 1:28:38 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not trying to be mean here
[12/1/22, 1:28:56 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sounds like a person who lacks the ability to comprehend feelings.
[12/1/22, 1:29:59 AM] Peter Peng: I was never really a fan of HR at work

[12/1/22, 1:31:20 AM] Anita Lamprecht: how to spot a psychopath. one of my kids friends was diagnosed as «without the ability to understand emotions of others» .. I saw her grow up for 5 years... very interesting learning.
[12/1/22, 1:31:32 AM] Anita Lamprecht: friends' kid
[12/1/22, 1:32:01 AM] Francois renet: exactly! tunnel vision that perpetuates individualism over collaboration and collectivism!
[12/1/22, 1:32:50 AM] Francois renet: my daughter had a friend like that who had 8 out of 10 traits of a psychopath. he was on a watchlist by the time he was 13!
[12/1/22, 1:33:38 AM] Francois renet: nor was I. especially in the US where it's all about protecting liability for the employer versus supporting employee goals and growth
[12/1/22, 1:38:34 AM] Peter Peng: Corporate culture was a mess and no longer became fun
[12/1/22, 1:39:14 AM] Peter Peng: I wish we could all go back to the 50’s like in the days of Mad Men
[12/1/22, 1:41:32 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like if work was more fun, the economy would be in better shape
[12/1/22, 1:41:39 AM] Francois renet: i was smoking two packs a cigarette in that context when i was in Luxembourg in the 90s (which was like the US in the 50s!)
[12/1/22, 1:43:43 AM] Peter Peng: Nowadays HR is made to villainize people and corporate culture has become stale.
[12/1/22, 1:44:43 AM] Peter Peng: Better off in a DAO trying to hustle crypto and NFTs
[12/1/22, 1:44:50 AM] Peter Peng: 😂
[12/1/22, 1:47:10 AM] Francois renet: it HAS to be about 'community building" inside the workplace. the ripple effect of concentric circles, from the micro to the macro level. the more we reenforce the concept of community, collaboration, support, sharing, the better the world will be.
[12/1/22, 1:49:46 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, “community” = mafia 😎
[12/1/22, 1:50:22 AM] Peter Peng: That’s how it’s like in NYC nowadays

[12/1/22, 2:09:43 AM] Francois renet: blah blah blah blah blah. At the end of the day, AI is a thought and correlation/data mining, extraction and interpretation tool. Humans creating the algorithms will be the difference between good and bad
[12/1/22, 2:12:00 AM] Francois renet: even though if we look at @41791555798 contribution earlier, and if having no feelings is the key to being a psychopath then... but then humans are supposed to have feelings, and the lack thereof is the issue, whereas machines are not meant to have feelings...oh what the hell do i know!! but my thought stands, the humans behind the algorithms will be the deciding factor
[12/1/22, 2:32:40 AM] Anita Lamprecht: psychopaths have feelings. just not really for others 😂 ¨

[12/1/22, 9:16:16 AM] Gary Teh: Another One of my favorite movies that is totally polarizing when you read the reviews on rotten tomatoes 🤣

Half the people love it the other half just gets totally confused by it 

My sense is a person used to sequential thinking will be totally confused by it

Whereas a person used to big picture intuitive thinking will be totally fascinated by it as it’s like seeing a jigsaw puzzle slowly coming into place
[12/1/22, 9:16:50 AM] Gary Teh: Actually what is the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath? 🙂🙏
[12/1/22, 9:27:28 AM] Francois renet: one kills you with a knife, the other with words
[12/1/22, 10:27:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I like the idea how souls develop and keep meeting each other throughout their different lives. experiencing all they need to learn. yes.. it is not a straight forward film. that makes it probably so attractive to the one side and - as you say- so unattractive to the other. I hardly ever read film reviews.🤷‍♀️
[12/1/22, 11:14:00 AM] Gary Teh: What about one who kills someone with someone else’s knife by persuading that someone else with his own words?? 🤔
[12/1/22, 11:25:19 AM] Peter Peng: If to protect, then it’s justified in my opinion. Soldiers are sent to war by Presidents all the time.

[12/1/22, 12:49:35 PM] Aga - DAOist: There are couple of videos on yt about it :) one aspect is that psychopaths are born and sociopaths are "created", psychopaths will be more neutral or even introvert, unable to create any bonds, while sociopaths can be very charming and outgoing, another moment can get furious, can make "fake" or "one-side" relationships to achieve their goals... They all like to manipulate people, have no empathy, answer pretty automatic sentences in terms of social interactions (what they learned is expected from others) - kind of "empty words"...
[12/1/22, 1:18:29 PM] Peter Peng: I guess it all depends on perspective. My question is did society make them this way or where they born like that. Classic nature vs. nurture debate.

[12/1/22, 10:55:05 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Not sure if my thought fits here … but what about high functioning autism. Aren’t such people kind of the other side of the “coin” in regard to psychopaths? Somehow they face the problem of … too much emotions. Kind of overkill which leads to numbness as survival tactic ?? But potentially the counterweight that is needed to balance psychopaths in this complex system …
[12/1/22, 10:58:04 PM] Gary Teh: Too much emotions? 🤔

I actually see of myself as slightly on the spectrum. I think my main challenge is reading emotions or even reading body cues sometimes 🤔🤣
[12/1/22, 11:07:06 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/1/22, 11:09:29 PM] Gary Teh: That was until I started doing the daily hour long meditation practice six years ago

Neural plasticity allows the brain to get rewired 

The tendency to deep dive into specific subjects when interest is piqued is still there though 

That deep dive tendency was reapplied to doing a deep dive into figuring out how psychology works

I know that Jerry has that brain pattern as well. I remember the executive coach the company hired to coach him in the previous company kind of took the same route of utilizing a cognitive trait which is a strength to balance off a cognitive trait which was weak

[12/1/22, 11:14:04 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 and before her Annelaura who were both experienced in executive coaching observed that same brain pattern in me and spent time helping recalibrating it 

@5511982667030 especially spent a lot of effort before I started experimenting with the whole meditation idea back six years ago 🤔
[12/1/22, 11:24:52 PM] Anita Lamprecht: one hour of meditation that is brave ... i already find 1 minute painful 😅
[12/1/22, 11:25:19 PM] Anita Lamprecht: but... if it works 🧐
[12/1/22, 11:26:03 PM] Anita Lamprecht: the deep dive is the good part, I guess... that shouldn't be lost.
[12/1/22, 11:36:21 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! Neural plasticity is a great phenomena 

With enough practice of deliberately directing attention over a prolonged period of time new neural pathways can be forged
[12/1/22, 11:37:28 PM] Gary Teh: After you get the hang of it, it’s can be a wonderful experience
[12/2/22, 12:31:36 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I will gradually extend my 1 minute 😎

[12/2/22, 3:56:06 AM] Anita Lamprecht: are we experiencing some kind of weird suicide of crypto?
[12/2/22, 3:56:51 AM] Peter Peng: Institutions are coming in
[12/2/22, 3:57:03 AM] Peter Peng: They are crushing all exchanges
[12/2/22, 3:57:29 AM] Peter Peng: I expect crypto to get bigger
[12/2/22, 3:58:19 AM] Peter Peng: Strap in, it’s going to be a wild ride!
[12/2/22, 4:00:19 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i only hold a very modest amount of crypto.. but the bad thing is that wehen big companies lose, all of us lose.
[12/2/22, 4:01:48 AM] Peter Peng: We are witnessing the collapse of the entire global financial system 😂
[12/2/22, 4:03:05 AM] Anita Lamprecht: such a positive outlook for our future. 😜
[12/2/22, 4:03:21 AM] Anita Lamprecht: so what is the best security net in this situation.
[12/2/22, 4:03:30 AM] Peter Peng: I’m sure something better will replace it
[12/2/22, 4:03:51 AM] Anita Lamprecht: where is the life saving lifebelt ?

[12/2/22, 4:05:06 AM] Peter Peng: I was going to say Dogecoin but everyone hates Elon Musk
[12/2/22, 4:05:11 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes. because it has the smart contract function (compared to bitcoin)
[12/2/22, 4:05:28 AM] Francois renet: Shares in Glock and Sig Sauer! 😂
[12/2/22, 4:05:38 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, we are about to witness the flippening
[12/2/22, 4:05:45 AM] Anita Lamprecht: and it is big enough to persist and grant the security blockchain promises?
[12/2/22, 4:06:03 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe it’s time I release my Jetson Coin

[12/2/22, 6:46:37 PM] Gary Teh: Actually I don't think it's a race thing. There is always some form of anomaly if you dig deep in every person's psyche. The anomaly is identified as one when viewed via the lenses of another person.

Cannibalism has been considered a traditional practice in parts of Southeast Asia. People who practice it consider it an act of love. Someone they feel dear to has past away, they decided to eat the love one.

Or after a tribal war, the winners decided to eat parts of a fallen warrior whom they believe have qualities they admire as warriors.

[12/5/22, 3:44:12 AM] Francois renet: he has been sick for a while, cancer and Parkinson's. the problem is that the world is punishing an entire mention that was already suffering for the madness of one man. to use @6598383264 analogy of a relationship, it's like punishing a partner's entire family and friends for the mistakes of one person
[12/5/22, 3:45:56 AM] Peter Peng: Well, this is why they need to take him out of power or he needs to die. The people are suffering (his own soldiers as well as Ukrainians)
[12/5/22, 3:47:00 AM] Tres Garcia: How bout they vote 🗳️ and enforce their democratic processes
[12/5/22, 3:47:14 AM] Peter Peng: They can’t
[12/5/22, 3:47:20 AM] Tres Garcia: If they want to vote for a jerk… let them
[12/5/22, 3:48:07 AM] Tres Garcia: Well if they can’t vote…. Then they probably have no business running the place
[12/5/22, 3:49:29 AM] Peter Peng: They don’t have a democratic process there
[12/5/22, 3:49:53 AM] Francois renet: have you seen what happens when they protest? The man does not care about his people any more than others. We have to STOP electing leaders, in government and business because they are egomaniacs and that seems to be the required quality to lead. the ability to always see the grand scheme over the consequences on the people
[12/5/22, 3:54:14 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s not true. 
They have a process. It’s not enforced.
[12/5/22, 3:54:38 AM] Peter Peng: Exactly
[12/5/22, 3:55:06 AM] Tres Garcia: So to say that the person to take over would be better is not a convincing argument
[12/5/22, 3:55:28 AM] Tres Garcia: It’s their country. Let them decide
[12/5/22, 3:56:04 AM] Peter Peng: I think we should take the oil while he’s weak
[12/5/22, 3:57:24 AM] Peter Peng: At least recoup money spent on the war he started
[12/5/22, 4:13:38 AM] Kelvin Chew: What I have heard is

1) ok to kill a nation for one man

2) if the nation is unable to get rid of a dictator. Then it’s not our fault we wanna kill the entire nation 

3) take everything of theirs. Grab their oil. Cos they are invading another country and killing people. 

4) So revenge and pillage is justified. 

Did I summarize it right ?
[12/5/22, 4:13:44 AM] Peter Peng: Starting this war really threw a wrench 🔧 in our economy
[12/5/22, 4:14:39 AM] Peter Peng: Well how do we recoup the losses and pay for the damage created?
[12/5/22, 4:15:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: So I take it that I summarize ur thoughts correctly?
[12/5/22, 4:15:39 AM] Peter Peng: I wouldn’t word it the way you did

[12/5/22, 6:43:17 AM] Tres Garcia: No. Absolutely not. 
That’s not why we fight. 
Also. More money in military spending anyway. So forget the oil
[12/5/22, 7:33:42 AM] Gary Teh: Yeah. Considering US already generated enough oil for its own internal consumption I am guessing it’s just finding opportunities to spend more money on military (to boost economy and jobs) 

Military spending is a form of fiscal policy
[12/5/22, 7:47:04 AM] Tres Garcia: ☝️I can’t argue against that.
[12/5/22, 8:02:26 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/5/22, 8:17:44 AM] Gary Teh: And so is going to war though sending in troops on the ground is way more costly than spending money on manufacturing new arms and “donating” older arms 🤔

I wonder if all 100% of the arms sent to Ukraine by the US is donation or some of them are in fact Ukrainian purchases of US military products 

From a different perspective i am actually not surprised US economy is still hot despite the very aggressive interest rate tightening by the Federal reserve. That is because fiscal policy is still running very very hot 

Historically during war times, the economy goes through a V curve where during the earlier portion of the war every thing tanks due to shock and uncertainty . 

In the latter part the economy booms especially for the victors since there is now excess demand for all things required for rebuilding across the board. 

In this scenario you can almost think of Ukraine as the dumping ground where all the old outdated unwanted military inventories (especially Russian equipment) get dumped by both sides (aka landfill)

After the war is done, there will be a period of rebuilding. Exports from other regions into the warring regions will increase, driving production demand and boosting economy across the board
[12/5/22, 8:20:54 AM] Peter Peng: Good analysis @14153000019 … I suppose we are “slow bleeding” Russia.
[12/5/22, 8:30:47 AM] Tres Garcia: 🤔 anyone want to go in on  warehouses in Eastern Europe? 
Grab old equipment for the next gig?
[12/5/22, 8:31:07 AM] Tres Garcia: One man’s trash = my treasure
[12/5/22, 9:36:59 AM] Gary Teh: Actually, I see it more like circulating the global economy

It’s only qualifies as slow bleeding Russia if Russia was not generating any income while it financed the trashing of old equipments

Russian Oil exports was still at almost normal levels during the entire war, just to different destinations as opposed to the usual ones based according to @6590995199 analysis a few months ago and at much elevated price per barrel 

European demand is going to come back online once they figure out the truce 

With oil price back to the usual range, Russian oil export revenue should about remain normalized 

When we cut through all the drama painted by the narratives, we are looking at total casualties of around 13K on the Ukrainian side (0.03% of population), 100K on the Russian side (0.069% of population)

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63829973

Net cost to Russia is quite low. 

It’s the Ukrainians that ended up being the ultimate scapegoat in the grander scheme of things 

The big boys needed to dump their old equipment and energize their economy and Ukraine became the defacto landfill (aka dumping ground) 🤔

Not saying it’s right or wrong, it just ended up being convenient for both sides

[12/5/22, 9:43:31 AM] Gary Teh: My sense is Taiwan is being setup as the next “landfill” once TSMC plant comes online and all American microchip needs come from that location 

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-Nvidia-to-be-first-customers-of-TSMC-Arizona-chip-plant

When the Taiwanese redline gets triggered the two parties facing each other will not be US and China but Japan (maybe other Allie’s) and China

US will probably not be physically involved once again. At most just another arms supplier to the Japanese side 🤔

This is the common pattern I observe that worked very well for US so far: Destabilizing a region and then selling arms to either one side (but ideally both sides)

Invasion and occupation exercises by the US had generally not been really profitable

[12/5/22, 8:53:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: Exactly right. Spot on. 

Let’s call a spade a spade. 

This war was usa created as most wars. 

A war country with the biggest military spending and supplies war equipments to the world needs wars to fuel that. No wars = bad for the war equipment industry. Reduces the rhetoric for war “defense” spending. 

When usa gives 500M in “aid” to Ukraine. Don’t for one instant think it’s 500M cash to Ukraine to spend as they wish. 

1) 500M goes to usa war factories to build new equipment OR spent purchasing existing equipment at full retail prices. Thereby giving max revenue to war equipment makers. 

2) then these 500M of product is like a forced “purchase” by Ukraine

3) in return 500M worth of debt is owed to Usa by Ukraine. To be paid via resources (resource grab by usa) or by long term liabilities. 

INSTANTLY 2x investment of the 500M. 500M (local revenue) plus 500M liabilities. 

Why do u think congress can squabble over healthcare aid to citizens (cost with no profit) but instantly gives out money to Ukraine?

Because usa is a saint? There are minor wars all over the world. But only Ukraine was assisted. 

Sorry. But this is a usa war driven move. Just like all the democratic bombings. For oil for resources. 

Putin was baited by usa. Putin was stupid enough to react to USA’s instigating shadow hands. 

Germany wanted to stop the oil sanctions and open nord stream pipes up. 

What happened? Boom. The pipes are mysteriously bombed. 

Usa who knows if Russia sneezes before they even sneeze doesn’t know who bombed the Russian oil pipes. And months after no investigation results. 

In one stroke. USA did these

1) crippled Russia
2) made the world go against its greatest enemies Russia and indirectly China 
3) sent Germany economy crumbling and thereby crippling Europe’s influence 
4) sent usd strongest in so many years
5) destroying Russia oil reliance 
6) fueling its war economy
7) creating a scape goat for soaring inflation which was present already before the war
8) now USA is number one. Undisputed master of the world. 
9) next move… to stir Taiwan to war with China and “protecting it” to create Ukraine 2.0 and cripple China. 

Masterful chess moves. With human life sacrificed by people who feel justified to kill the enemy and becoming heroes of the worlds like all the great American films.

[12/8/22, 10:19:27 AM] Gary Teh: This brings to mind something I noticed when I was reading through Xenophone when I was traversing down the coast of Africa 

Market today as we understand it today somewhat quite differently from how it does during the time of Xenophone. 

Today when we want to join a market all we need to do is just go online to some websites and then list our wares for sale and we assume there will be someone on the other side 

In their case as well as during the times of the age of exploration, “market” is not always available and readily had at the snap of the finger

When their troops where withdrawing from Africa back to Greece they would often need to seek “market” with the villages they come across along their route 

“market” is only made available if they manage to develop enough trust/relationship with the villagers. Then and only then do the villagers bring out and display their wares they want to make available for “market” 

I sense the Meta pattern is the human relationship (culture) first forms before a “market” can develop. This is especially true during the very early stages. The dynamics is very counter intuitive when just simply observing massive markets

https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ 

Here's what OpenAI had to say about your comment above about "World Enabled" Patrick: 

Victor Asks: What do you think about my brother's statement above? Is it a valid argument? What else may be missing? 

Chat.OpenAi.com Answers: Your brother's statement above provides a potential interpretation of the term "world enabled" in the context of disability, and describes some of the ways in which this concept might be realized in practice. In general, the statement provides a valid argument, as it highlights the importance of creating a supportive and inclusive environment for people with disabilities.

However, there may be other factors that are relevant to a "world enabled" for people with disabilities. For example, the statement does not mention the need for policies and programs that promote the rights and dignity of people with disabilities, or the importance of addressing issues such as discrimination and stigma. Additionally, the statement does not discuss the potential role of technology and innovation in enabling greater participation and inclusion for people with disabilities.

Overall, while the statement provides a valid argument, there may be other factors and considerations that are relevant to the concept of a "world enabled" for people with disabilities. Further discussion and exploration of this topic may be needed to fully understand its implications and potential applications.

Victor: Please elaborate. 

Chat.openai.com: Sure, here are some additional ideas and considerations that might be relevant when discussing the concept of a "world enabled" for people with disabilities:

In order to create a "world enabled" for people with disabilities, it is important to recognize the unique challenges and barriers that people with disabilities face, and to take action to address these issues. This might include things like providing accessible infrastructure, supporting inclusive education, and promoting employment opportunities for people with disabilities.

A "world enabled" for people with disabilities should also focus on promoting the rights and dignity of people with disabilities. This might include things like ensuring that people with disabilities have access to justice and legal protections, and that they are able to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association.

Technology and innovation can play a key role in enabling greater participation and inclusion for people with disabilities. For example, advances in assistive technology, such as adaptive devices and software, can help to remove barriers and support the independence and autonomy of people with disabilities.

In order to create a truly "world enabled" for people with disabilities, it is important to involve and consult with people with disabilities themselves, and to ensure that their voices and perspectives are included in decision-making processes. This can help to ensure that policies and programs are responsive to the needs and concerns of people with disabilities

[12/9/22, 12:01:18 AM] Gary Teh: Seems it really digested a lot of the literature out there before churning out this piece of write up about world enabled
[12/9/22, 12:02:01 AM] Gary Teh: There are parts that are definitely very familiar sounding 

Thanks for the share! 🤩
[12/9/22, 12:04:55 AM] Victor Pineda: Here's literally an overview of the book I am writing. I only gave it the title of the book and it perfectly structured the proposal. This is very very freaky as I am one of the leading experts in this field. 

Book Proposal 
 
Title: Inclusion and Belonging in Cities of Tomorrow: Governance and Access by Design
Author: Victor Santiago Pineda, PhD
 
Overview:
In the rapidly urbanizing world of today, the challenges of creating inclusive and equitable cities are more pressing than ever. As urban populations continue to grow, the need for effective governance and design strategies to promote inclusion and belonging in cities becomes increasingly urgent.
 
In this book, [Author's Name] offers a comprehensive examination of the ways in which cities can be designed and governed to foster greater inclusion and belonging for all residents. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical frameworks and empirical research, the book explores the challenges and opportunities of creating inclusive cities in the 21st century.
 
The book is divided into three main sections. The first section provides an overview of the concept of inclusion and belonging in cities, examining the ways in which these concepts are related to urban governance and design. The second section focuses on the key challenges and opportunities for creating inclusive and equitable cities, exploring topics such as urban planning, transport, and housing. The third section examines the role of access by design in fostering inclusion and belonging in cities, exploring the ways in which design can be used to create more equitable and accessible urban spaces.
 
Throughout the book, Victor Pineda offers practical insights and recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and other stakeholders seeking to promote inclusion and belonging in cities of tomorrow. With its interdisciplinary approach and focus on real-world examples, this book will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in creating more inclusive and equitable cities.
 
Market:
This book will appeal to a wide range of audiences, including urban planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in the design and governance of cities. The book will also be of interest to students and researchers in urban studies, sociology, and related disciplines.
 
Competition:
While there are many books on urban planning and governance, few address the specific challenges of promoting inclusion and belonging in cities. [Author's Name]'s book will stand out by offering a comprehensive and interdisciplinary examination of this critical issue.
 
Author:
Victor Pineda is an urban planner and researcher with over 20 years of experience in the field. Dr. Pineda has published widely on topics related to urban governance and design, and has worked on numerous projects focused on promoting inclusion and belonging in cities. Dr. Pineda is currently an adjunct professor of urban planning at the University of California Berkeley.

Should be able to finally get around to it once i get some of the Cypher Defense stuff off of my plate 

That way when @17755088150 does the pitching interested supporters could just go ahead and back our DAO’s by mining our governance token’s liquidity 🤩🙏

They been just freely passing joints around the camp fires the past few nights 

I know half the folks I bump into at some campfires will high in acid the past few nights 

Just last week i heard one dude who was high on meth thought he was mike Tyson and chewed off this other dude’s ear after they got into a fight. 😱

[12/15/22, 7:56:19 AM] Gary Teh: Have you tried it before?

I know fentanyl is very popular amongst folks in the Midwest 

Was speaking to the camp leader of flamingo 

She mentioned the crew who were guarding the camp this last summer we just meth heads
[12/15/22, 7:56:47 AM] Gary Teh: The winter crew had to spend a few days cleaning up the mess when they moved in

[12/15/22, 8:08:45 AM] Peter Peng: Drugs are no longer as fun as they used to be

[12/15/22, 9:21:04 AM] Peter Peng: It’s where I grew up so I’m close to my friends and family. Plus my girlfriend wants me to move there since it’s warmer and she is from LA.

[12/15/22, 11:42:24 AM] Gary Teh: Knowing him, I won’t be surprised if this ends up being the collection of the century 🤣

Speaking of which, it dawned on me this morning the whole Web3 and decentralization space has already been consolidated at this point 

Almost nothing new in terms of technology exploration wise. 

it might be interesting if you are keen to just be consulting service provider for large enterprises like a lot of what I am seeing out there 

But you will most likely end up being forced to build on top of one of those big tech platforms however much you want to rage against the machine
[12/15/22, 11:43:42 AM] Gary Teh: In that regard what @6581766589 @381666027979 @41799155602 @919158729122 @17472295463 are providing tech development wise might be viable business models
[12/15/22, 11:46:56 AM] Gary Teh: The age of the pioneering futurist/technologist explorer in the domain of Web3 and decentralization is nearing its end

The age of the marketeer has just dawned 

Within a few years, it will be mainly just moving bits from here to there

[12/15/22, 11:49:02 AM] Peter Peng: I think that Generative AI is the new focus and building that on top of a layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain is the path Jetson X is headed.
[12/15/22, 11:49:53 AM] Peter Peng: I’m sticking with ETH (Polygon or Avalanche)
[12/15/22, 11:50:15 AM] Peter Peng: Have yet to try Avalanche but have heard great things.
[12/15/22, 11:51:25 AM] Peter Peng: If I want to create a Jetson Coin I can just make it ERC20 and not reinvent the wheel
[12/15/22, 11:52:38 AM] Peter Peng: All these companies trying to create their own layer 1 is kind of silly.
[12/15/22, 12:00:59 PM] Tres Garcia: Ok…. So this is actually really funny and also kind of cool & at a decent value…. (Like him or not) the video sums it all up perfectly. (Fantastic…. marketing-team)

Would be even funnier if it was a deep fake
[12/15/22, 12:05:28 PM] Peter Peng: Deep fakes are hilarious
[12/15/22, 12:05:53 PM] Peter Peng: Should make a coin for deepfake technology
[12/15/22, 12:19:42 PM] Peter Peng: I should create a coin for AI and have all of my mafia / gangster friends invest in it. JETSON Mafia keeps the AI under control for US government. 😎

[12/15/22, 11:02:21 PM] Gary Teh: The end user experience might be having a FaceTime conversation with “someone” on the other end which had basically access to the entire world’s human knowledge in its head 

Omniscient, almost omnipresent 

Probably not omnipotent yet until robotics advances far enough
[12/15/22, 11:03:09 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, when you ask your “AI god” to order you a cheeseburger 🍔
[12/15/22, 11:03:27 PM] Peter Peng: And a robot 🤖 delivers it
[12/15/22, 11:03:32 PM] Gary Teh: Or maybe if Boston dynamics is kind enough allow us access to its hardware then perhaps 

Omniscient, almost omnipresent and semi-potent
[12/15/22, 11:04:01 PM] Peter Peng: Impotent 🤭
[12/15/22, 11:04:41 PM] Gary Teh: We are really on the cusps of heading back to doing nothing dude once these three components are combined together 

It is just one small gap right now
[12/15/22, 11:06:34 PM] Peter Peng: This is what rich people do anyway, lay around talking to people while they have people serve them… robots will democratize this for everyone.
[12/15/22, 11:06:45 PM] Gary Teh: And imagine throwing in the nuclear fusion technology we just finally got to work recently

That is going to make whatever robotic creator that gets summoned to live almost omniscient, very semi-present and very semi-potent

Give it a few years of iteration and the semi starts trending towards Omni 

Beyond a certain threshold almost no different from god
[12/15/22, 11:07:21 PM] Peter Peng: We can then start to colonize other planets

[12/15/22, 11:20:57 PM] Peter Peng: It’s time to commercialize and industrialize AI to the masses.
[12/15/22, 11:24:20 PM] Peter Peng: Next step is to throw the AI “brain” on the block to “chain” it up. Enslaving the AI is not inhumane and should not have the same rights as people.
[12/15/22, 11:24:26 PM] Peter Peng: At first
[12/15/22, 11:24:56 PM] Peter Peng: Eventually we will create a moral and ethical framework for AI… but now is not the time.
[12/15/22, 11:25:10 PM] Peter Peng: Or we’ll get nothing done…

This evening sitting around the campfire is another one of those times.

Primarily cause for this complain is that there is just too much content being generated for anyone person to have time to truly digest. 

Information overload facilitates information pollution

[12/16/22, 12:01:42 AM] Peter Peng: 😂
[12/16/22, 12:02:04 AM] Peter Peng: People are catching on
[12/16/22, 12:04:06 AM] Gary Teh: Headed to bed now 

Having an early morning meeting with the folks at House of Balance to chat about some logistics stuff 💤
[12/16/22, 11:11:50 AM] Aga - DAOist: About crypto business ideas, I got to know the founder of this solution cryptoterminal and he is a very nice community guy who helps us, me & @8618926086648 develop the OffChain Poland chapters with his many contacts. 

P.S. he didn't ask me for any promotion. I do it because he was actually very supportive and modest with all his achievements. Therefore I will be grateful if you keep it in mind for any of your connections 🤗

[12/16/22, 11:28:58 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Thanks for sharing!! 🤩
[12/16/22, 12:19:13 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Gary, can you please (re)send the verification email to my personal email address anlamp614@gmail.com  thank you. 🙏
[12/16/22, 12:23:36 PM] Gary Teh: Which verification email?

From the website? 🙂
[12/16/22, 1:20:06 PM] Gary Teh: @491736386942 by the way, if you ever need someone to help as moderator of panels, you might also want to consider @48606646246 

Just realized she was helping Mercedes do a lot of their events planning when she was there 🤩
[12/16/22, 1:26:37 PM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Can you expand on this please? Why would the fake be necessary?

I’ve been trying to be consistent on social media for some time but this December I decided to get off social media (Instagram and fb) just to tune into myself and see how it feels.

The amount of adverts is what really was overwhelming me I think. I barely see updates from friends anymore, which is primarily what I use fb for.

I am trying to make a plan for January - do I go back to social media? What is the purpose of me having social media? Would I be better off being consistent on one platform (my choice would be YouTube) and ditch everything else?

As someone said there is too much information and hard to tell what’s real anymore. My brain just couldn’t handle it! 

Found that this month I’ve spent way more time: in the gym, practicing yoga, editing photos, talking with friends, reading books, writing poetry etc

Instagram in particular seems to be a big issue in my life personally. Thoughts?
[12/16/22, 1:30:58 PM] Aga - DAOist: Thank you @14153000019 for this promo 🙏🥰

Next year I am planning events for OffChain in a few cities in Poland, as well Women in Blockchain Talks in Warsaw. If anyone visits Poland, let's catch up there 🤗 or in Luxemboug where I live 😅
[12/16/22, 1:34:12 PM] Aga - DAOist: That was a topic I also mentioned during our last talk about marketing with @48691650760. I believe marketing should also go towards balance and respectful approach to ppl's time. In the end, authenticity and true missions will win. We sense more what resonates with us and what is "fake". It will be harder to fool ppl..
[12/16/22, 3:42:33 PM] Peter Peng: Well, you can’t have one without the other. How would you know what “real” is?
[12/16/22, 3:57:08 PM] Peter Peng: I believe that balance is key. There is nothing wrong with taking a break from social media and I commend you for being self-aware enough to know that you need to unplug.

I’m a bit different from most people as I tend not to overthink things. If I feel like doing it then I will, if it becomes too much then I’ll stop. I basically just go with the flow of life as it comes regardless of what society thinks of me.
[12/16/22, 4:06:38 PM] Peter Peng: I primarily use social media or technology for work. I’ve pulled millions of dollars off of social media ( LinkedIn, FB, and IG ) so I want to be on as many platforms as possible. 

Most of my interactions on social media lead to real life encounters or meetings so it’s hard for me to say that it’s a bad thing.
[12/16/22, 4:12:36 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I’ve developed a strong “spidey sense” of what is real and what is fake online. You just need to trust your vibes I suppose.

[12/16/22, 4:17:42 PM] Peter Peng: A DAO can’t be truly “autonomous” without AI.
[12/16/22, 4:18:11 PM] Peter Peng: I’m trying to turn the US government into a DAO 😂
[12/16/22, 4:20:17 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/16/22, 4:25:31 PM] Gary Teh: That is correct! 🤩

Even @12063955455 raised this when we were chatting a few months ago 

He suggested that TrueSight DAO at some point make available an AI model that other DAOs can rely upon to provide Justice within their ecosystem 

Wasn’t seeing clearly how that might pan out but seems as the ecosystem evolves and more and more reveals itself, the path forward starts slowly coming into focus
[12/16/22, 4:27:35 PM] Peter Peng: I was more or less thinking, how can we use AI to take all the busy work out of running and growing a DAO
[12/16/22, 4:32:04 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to chat with babes all day and vote on world changing topics and get paid to do it. This is what a shadow president does 😂
[12/16/22, 4:32:44 PM] Peter Peng: 🤭
‎[12/16/22, 5:05:48 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/16/22, 6:34:03 PM] Peter Peng: Haha basically
[12/16/22, 6:36:11 PM] Peter Peng: Except I’m “real” and he’s “fake”.
[12/16/22, 8:13:48 PM] Peter Peng: I wonder who is the shadow dictator or North Korea?
[12/16/22, 9:54:58 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like dropping a bomb on North Korea for fun. 💣
[12/16/22, 9:58:06 PM] Peter Peng: We’ll make the whole world clap 👏
[12/16/22, 9:58:51 PM] Peter Peng: Americans like to blow shit up.
[12/16/22, 9:59:05 PM] Peter Peng: 🇺🇸
[12/16/22, 10:00:11 PM] Peter Peng: It would also be a way to get the media to stop talking about Elon Musk
[12/16/22, 10:00:49 PM] Peter Peng: And I don’t think anyone would care really…
[12/16/22, 10:04:01 PM] Peter Peng: Sometimes in this world of fakeness, we must remind the world who is the “truth”.
[12/16/22, 10:05:03 PM] Peter Peng: Dropping a bomb on North Korea would certainly be the fastest way to get the whole world realigned.
[12/16/22, 10:48:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: ‎This message was deleted.
[12/16/22, 10:49:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: That will also be a way of getting history to stop talking about Hitler too
[12/16/22, 10:50:06 PM] Peter Peng: How? North Korea keeps firing test nuclear weapons toward us. It’s basically a preventative measure.
[12/16/22, 10:50:43 PM] Peter Peng: Do it one more time…
[12/16/22, 10:51:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: I got a question though
[12/16/22, 10:51:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: What if someone drives 10
Miles to your home
[12/16/22, 10:51:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: Takes out a heavy machine gun and parades infront of your doorstep
[12/16/22, 10:51:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: But does nothing.
[12/16/22, 10:52:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Only walks around outside your home
[12/16/22, 10:52:07 PM] Peter Peng: In America you can light them up
[12/16/22, 10:52:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: So u sent a fleet of destroyers. Half a world away across the great pacific. Parade it infront at the door step of China
[12/16/22, 10:52:43 PM] Kelvin Chew: Should China start shouting?
[12/16/22, 10:52:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Shooting-*
[12/16/22, 10:53:06 PM] Peter Peng: China doesn’t like North Korea either
[12/16/22, 10:53:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Oh they did. They fired warning shots into the sea
[12/16/22, 10:53:16 PM] Peter Peng: We are doing them a favor
[12/16/22, 10:53:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: And China is the bad guys for doing that
[12/16/22, 10:53:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: Sorry. North Korea is under BRICS. China and North Korea are friends
[12/16/22, 10:54:06 PM] Peter Peng: Well if China is too scared to take care of North Korea we’ll handle it.
[12/16/22, 10:54:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s good to keep a rabid dog whose eyes are glaring at your enemy which you can let lose anytime
[12/16/22, 10:54:31 PM] Peter Peng: So then China is the bad one?
[12/16/22, 10:54:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: Is usa the bad one
[12/16/22, 10:54:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: To China. Usa is the bad guy
[12/16/22, 10:54:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: To usa the China is the bad guy
[12/16/22, 10:54:59 PM] Peter Peng: Why?
[12/16/22, 10:55:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: Perspectives
[12/16/22, 10:55:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: I can tell u. A lot of people in this world. Do not like usa for its war mongering.
[12/16/22, 10:55:37 PM] Peter Peng: Well, if you are going to shoot warning shots then pretend to be shot
[12/16/22, 10:56:01 PM] Peter Peng: Because this is no longer a test
[12/16/22, 10:56:09 PM] Peter Peng: We are for real
[12/16/22, 10:56:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe you are sheltered by western media.
[12/16/22, 10:56:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: But this is a fact. Even in Europe
[12/16/22, 10:56:35 PM] Peter Peng: Or you are influenced by the Chinese media
[12/16/22, 10:56:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: Loads of people do not have a good opinion of the usa.
[12/16/22, 10:56:53 PM] Peter Peng: Lots of people do not like China
[12/16/22, 10:57:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am from Singapore. An allied usa country. Whose naval bases, the usa uses as outstrip
[12/16/22, 10:57:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Pitstop
[12/16/22, 10:57:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just because I don’t agree with usa. Doesn’t mean I am from China
[12/16/22, 10:57:31 PM] Peter Peng: The whole world is moving toward decentralization because they want to topple large authoritarian government like China and Russia
[12/16/22, 10:57:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: You just can’t handle alternative views
[12/16/22, 10:57:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: Very close minded
[12/16/22, 10:58:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway. Have a good night
[12/16/22, 10:58:33 PM] Peter Peng: No, I’m saying… don’t play games. The USA has a track record of retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:58:39 PM] Peter Peng: That’s all
[12/16/22, 10:58:54 PM] Peter Peng: If you really want to test it
[12/16/22, 10:58:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: U call it retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:59:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: But a lot of people can tell. It’s not.
[12/16/22, 10:59:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa makes the first move. Then call it retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:59:25 PM] Peter Peng: How?
[12/16/22, 10:59:38 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t do well with threats
[12/16/22, 10:59:43 PM] Kelvin Chew: So remember the Cuba missile crisis?
[12/16/22, 11:00:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: Where Russia placed missiles at Cuba at the doorstep of usa?
[12/16/22, 11:00:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s wrong right?
[12/16/22, 11:00:28 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, nothing happened because they knew what the consequences would be… remember Hiroshima?
[12/16/22, 11:00:42 PM] Peter Peng: “Never Forget”
[12/16/22, 11:00:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: So usa placing missiles in Ukraine. Makes them right?
[12/16/22, 11:00:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: See the double standards?
[12/16/22, 11:01:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: So in Ukraine. Russia hit “civilians”. Not war equipment. Not soldiers and they are monsters
[12/16/22, 11:01:29 PM] Peter Peng: Well, I guess we’ll just have to see who’s really the strongest and find out.
[12/16/22, 11:01:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hiroshima killed Millions of civilians. Doing nothing
[12/16/22, 11:01:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: Babies
[12/16/22, 11:01:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: Old people
[12/16/22, 11:01:47 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hospitals
[12/16/22, 11:01:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Schools
[12/16/22, 11:01:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: Women
[12/16/22, 11:02:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: People who don’t even know or care about any war
[12/16/22, 11:02:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: Doing daily stuff
[12/16/22, 11:02:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: Boom. All dead
[12/16/22, 11:02:11 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, so think twice… unless you want it to happen again.
[12/16/22, 11:02:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: And u celebrate it?
[12/16/22, 11:02:16 PM] Peter Peng: Understand?
[12/16/22, 11:02:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: So Russian shooting hospitals are monsters?
[12/16/22, 11:02:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: So can they justify this way?
[12/16/22, 11:03:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am only asking you to apply the Same set of standards
[12/16/22, 11:03:14 PM] Peter Peng: Yes because they are trying to start war… not end it.
[12/16/22, 11:03:17 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am taking the side of fairness
[12/16/22, 11:03:29 PM] Peter Peng: The USA is here to end war
[12/16/22, 11:03:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: In their perspectives. They are trying to end their version of Cuba missile crisis
[12/16/22, 11:03:39 PM] Peter Peng: So we are the most corrupt
[12/16/22, 11:03:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: So Iraq. What war did u end
[12/16/22, 11:04:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: The flurry of missiles bombed and killed a million
[12/16/22, 11:04:14 PM] Peter Peng: The oil war
[12/16/22, 11:04:28 PM] Kelvin Chew: Who gave u the right
[12/16/22, 11:04:41 PM] Peter Peng: God
[12/16/22, 11:05:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hitler killed Jews in the name of his version of god too
[12/16/22, 11:05:19 PM] Peter Peng: Hitler tried to destroy god
[12/16/22, 11:05:27 PM] Peter Peng: He lost
[12/16/22, 11:05:48 PM] Peter Peng: Communists try to destroy religion
[12/16/22, 11:06:06 PM] Peter Peng: They try to destroy god
[12/16/22, 11:06:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: When u go this direction. It’s illogical debate. I will end it. I can’t discuss things that just don’t make sense
[12/16/22, 11:06:22 PM] Peter Peng: So sometimes you need to send a reminder
[12/16/22, 11:06:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ok. Nuke the whole world then
[12/16/22, 11:06:34 PM] Peter Peng: That god exists
[12/16/22, 11:06:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: In the name of God
[12/16/22, 11:06:51 PM] Peter Peng: Nah, just North Korea
[12/16/22, 11:07:09 PM] Peter Peng: Since he claims he is the god-king
[12/16/22, 11:07:27 PM] Peter Peng: He’s not the real god
[12/16/22, 11:07:58 PM] Peter Peng: He’s a baby
[12/16/22, 11:10:57 PM] Peter Peng: Nothing to debate, we are just verifying the truth… that god is “real”. That’s the point of this DAO right?
[12/16/22, 11:16:44 PM] Peter Peng: If China wants to fuck around and find out, we’ll make it fucking rain ☔️ nukes.
[12/16/22, 11:18:48 PM] Peter Peng: And no one is going to do a damn thing about it.
[12/16/22, 11:19:08 PM] Peter Peng: But clap 👏
[12/16/22, 11:22:46 PM] Peter Peng: Do not underestimate the “dark side” of the collective consciousness

[12/16/22, 11:56:32 PM] Anita Lamprecht: maybe we need subjectivity ? is there an objective truth of justice? human history was mainly written by men as women were and still are not allowed to participate in all facets of life. we would need to add a kind of corrector.
[12/16/22, 11:58:06 PM] Peter Peng: Women already run things in the shadow.
[12/16/22, 11:58:24 PM] Anita Lamprecht: it is cold in the shadow
[12/16/22, 11:58:58 PM] Anita Lamprecht: and the shadow is not in the books from which AI should get its wisdom...
[12/16/22, 11:58:59 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why they say, behind every great man is a woman.
[12/16/22, 11:59:12 PM] Anita Lamprecht: this is such an interesting point
[12/16/22, 11:59:18 PM] Peter Peng: Exactly
[12/16/22, 11:59:21 PM] Anita Lamprecht: stalin, hitler, putin all hiding their women
[12/16/22, 11:59:53 PM] Peter Peng: Women secretly run the world
[12/17/22, 12:00:48 AM] Peter Peng: It’s a conspiracy
[12/17/22, 12:01:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: just nature trying to balance things: what is strong needs to be weak and vice versa?
[12/17/22, 12:03:31 AM] Peter Peng: No I believe they control everything, they just choose to balance because it’s more beautiful that way.
[12/17/22, 12:03:59 AM] Peter Peng: Also, women are more responsible than men lol 😂

[12/17/22, 2:38:15 AM] Kelvin Chew: Weapons of mass destruction in the name of “heroic defense”

Sorry I don’t buy it.
[12/17/22, 2:39:54 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way to keep the peace
[12/17/22, 2:41:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Peace is when u talk and negotiate for peace. 

U don’t do it by sending more weapons. Refusing to pick up Russian phone calls to talk.
[12/17/22, 2:41:57 AM] Kelvin Chew: Otherwise it’s just tyranny under the flag of justice
[12/17/22, 2:42:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: Remember the crusades?
[12/17/22, 2:42:20 AM] Kelvin Chew: Killing in the name of God
[12/17/22, 2:42:28 AM] Peter Peng: This is used when negotiations fail
[12/17/22, 2:42:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: There wasn’t even any to begin with
[12/17/22, 2:42:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: Pls read up more
[12/17/22, 2:43:07 AM] Peter Peng: Alright, let’s keep it that way
[12/17/22, 2:43:39 AM] Peter Peng: Now you know who is in control of global trade
[12/17/22, 2:43:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: So let’s call a spade a spade. Usa. Wants war. Let’s at least stop pretending. I can admire honesty
[12/17/22, 2:44:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just don’t be a hypocrite
[12/17/22, 2:45:40 AM] Peter Peng: Listen, I’m a lover not a fighter… but sometimes the lovers are the craziest ones.
[12/17/22, 2:45:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Say. Look. Usa is king of the world. Whoever disobeys us will suffer under total destruction. We decide who dies who lives. Who trades with who. What assets belong to whom. 

Plain and simple. This i salute. Out right honest dictatorship of the whole world. 

All is fair in conquest. Just just brand it under something else
[12/17/22, 2:46:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just don’t brand it under something else. 

Don’t pretend to be a saviour when it is the destroyer
[12/17/22, 2:48:13 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not pretending to be anything… I’m the truth
[12/17/22, 2:48:56 AM] Peter Peng: China might be the devil, but the USA is the truth.
[12/17/22, 2:49:07 AM] Peter Peng: The devil is a lie
[12/17/22, 2:49:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. Sure. Whatever u call it. Just don’t be a hypocrite
[12/17/22, 2:49:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: If u like killing. Just say that. Don’t pretend u are killing for others
[12/17/22, 2:50:08 AM] Kelvin Chew: We Singaporeans. Don’t need China to be killed. Don’t kill them for us. U can kill them for yourselves. Just to pretend to be our saviours which we never asked for
[12/17/22, 2:50:48 AM] Peter Peng: Never said that, we do it to control the economy
[12/17/22, 2:51:01 AM] Peter Peng: This is big business
[12/17/22, 2:51:06 AM] Kelvin Chew: Oppression.
[12/17/22, 2:51:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just like slavery

[12/18/22, 6:05:46 AM] Gary Teh: A quick update on project EcoVerse21 

Chatting with Peter now to figure out distribution of goods in his network in Singapore. Figured out a demand we are now doing sourcing in Africa
[12/18/22, 6:48:13 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[12/18/22, 6:51:52 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[12/18/22, 7:37:06 AM] Gary Teh: Not @14075792560 but Peter Gwee who is based in Singapore 🤣
[12/18/22, 8:20:32 AM] Peter Peng: There can only be one Peter
[12/18/22, 8:20:43 AM] Peter Peng: We must fight to the death
[12/18/22, 9:37:48 AM] Gary Teh: Lol! Sure. Right now the competition is to fight on who can find the most buyers for the products we are sourcing out of Africa. 

Peter has already sourced for a whole bunch of buyers in Singapore. 

Would be happy for you to fight to be the winner by sourcing for buyers based in New York City for African exports. 🤩
[12/18/22, 9:38:46 AM] Peter Peng: I’m heading to Miami!
[12/18/22, 9:39:03 AM] Peter Peng: What African exports?
[12/18/22, 9:39:27 AM] Peter Peng: I need pure Columbia’s exports
[12/18/22, 9:39:53 AM] Peter Peng: Can you get blood diamonds?
[12/18/22, 9:40:08 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! Miami is good market too! 

These are the list we have sourced for so far
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbbrDWe-LhxEPTBCJQQoiIGy-3uffZaGu0KWu7PZBWs/edit?usp=share_link
[12/18/22, 9:40:18 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly agricultural produce right now.
[12/18/22, 9:40:33 AM] Gary Teh: Unfortunately, that is not aligned with our value system.
[12/18/22, 9:40:43 AM] Peter Peng: I’m joking
‎[12/18/22, 9:41:15 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 9:41:17 AM] Peter Peng: Do you have prices attached?
[12/18/22, 9:41:35 AM] Gary Teh: The prices fluctuate depending on volume as well as supply
[12/18/22, 9:42:01 AM] Gary Teh: Once a buyer express interest we can head back to the producers to ask for the pricing based on the availability.
[12/18/22, 9:42:26 AM] Peter Peng: How long does it take?
[12/18/22, 9:43:44 AM] Gary Teh: Depends on where it gets shipped to and the mode of shipping. If to Miami might be a week or more.

If the source is more in land might take longer

Right now we are mainly sourcing along coastal areas. 

Main ports we are looking to export out from are Lagos Nigeria, Dar Es Salem Tanzania.
[12/18/22, 9:44:41 AM] Gary Teh: The way I am seeing it, our DAO will do the match making and the QC and then take a cut from the buy and sell. DAO members will be able to vote on a stable fix rate we want to take from it
[12/18/22, 9:45:17 AM] Gary Teh: The cut will be channelled to our treasury to back the value of our governance tokens that are in circulation.
[12/18/22, 9:48:34 AM] Peter Peng: Love it
[12/18/22, 9:49:20 AM] Peter Peng: Are these just raw goods?
[12/18/22, 9:49:28 AM] Peter Peng: No packaging?
[12/18/22, 9:52:47 AM] Gary Teh: Those on the list are bulk items. 

We could also source for packaged consumer goods.
[12/18/22, 9:53:46 AM] Tres Garcia: What is the scale of shipment? 
Pallets vs containers? (Kg vs Mt)
Frequency?
Quality? 
I think a basic brokerage model would be best approach to add the DAO into the value chain. 
The shipper & buyer will need a letter of credit (difficult to obtain) 
Will also have to have a solid process for QA prior to and after shipping. 
The Letter of Credit can reduce some risk, but if spoils happen too ofen, you will loose the service. 
PM me a list of ports you want to ship to, and I’ll dig into local food manufacturers and distributors that would be interested in buying. 
Food mfg have a strict QA process to guarantee quality. So it may be better to target US Foods and Sysco since they will already have existing QA processes. 
It will cost you at least $1,500 per SKU to get onboarded with US foods or Sysco.
[12/18/22, 9:55:39 AM] Tres Garcia: Alternatively, I would recommend starting a US based LLC to maintain liability and processes. 
Then sell to interested parties once the product has passesed QA and or is repackaged
[12/18/22, 9:55:45 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Omg please can we leave Africa alone?! Western capitalist values have already ruined so much of the world. Can we leave one corner of the world in its raw beauty PLEASE!!
[12/18/22, 9:56:30 AM] Peter Peng: We’ll give you some hush money
[12/18/22, 9:56:53 AM] Tres Garcia: Sorry. No. We can’t. 
China 🇨🇳 will lot leave it alone, and the best chance for Africa is become great to to enable its independence through fair trade,
[12/18/22, 9:57:05 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: One thing missing from business education, or at least rarely practiced, is ethics, social awareness and long term sustainability.
[12/18/22, 9:57:23 AM] Peter Peng: Trying to figure out how to put all of this on the blockchain
[12/18/22, 9:57:23 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Africa is already great
[12/18/22, 9:57:43 AM] Tres Garcia: The Looting Machine: Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth https://a.co/d/63WYpLa
https://a.co/d/63WYpLa
[12/18/22, 9:59:28 AM] Tres Garcia: The continent has a terrible history of being exploited. I do not see that changing in our lifetime, but I do see progress against corruption and terrible business deals that leave African interests further in debt to foreign influence. 
Free market is their only way to maintain true independence
[12/18/22, 9:59:32 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Western Intervention was never needed anywhere, we just went for it for nothing but personal profit (sometimes disguised as benevolence). It’s time we learnt from our mistakes and stop trying to change what isn’t broken. Leave Africa and Africans and African wild spaces alone! 

It’s not all about money you know…
[12/18/22, 9:59:58 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe blockchain can help
[12/18/22, 10:00:05 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Perhaps
[12/18/22, 10:00:10 AM] Tres Garcia: I completely disagree. Do nothing will do more harm than good.
[12/18/22, 10:00:21 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I don’t know enough about blockchain to comment on that
[12/18/22, 10:00:26 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: How so?
[12/18/22, 10:00:28 AM] Tres Garcia: Yes! 
Holding people accountable
[12/18/22, 10:00:57 AM] Peter Peng: If governed by a good DAO
[12/18/22, 10:01:05 AM] Tres Garcia: Documenting transitions to ensure elected officials are not lining their pockets with public resources
[12/18/22, 10:01:09 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Why can’t it be led by Africans?
[12/18/22, 10:01:22 AM] Peter Peng: They are the corrupt ones
[12/18/22, 10:01:32 AM] Tres Garcia: Who says we are not?
[12/18/22, 10:01:48 AM] Tres Garcia: Home is where you lay your head.
[12/18/22, 10:02:17 AM] Peter Peng: I believe Africans can become apart of our DAO
[12/18/22, 10:02:38 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: There is a small section of corrupt and power hungry Africans, sure, but the vast majority of the continent is still free from thinking the way we do in the west - and good for them!

We have the greatest rates of misery in the west. Perhaps we should think about redefining development and think of what the end goal is?
[12/18/22, 10:03:49 AM] Peter Peng: Agree, just because they are poor doesn’t mean they are happy
[12/18/22, 10:04:04 AM] Peter Peng: *aren’t
[12/18/22, 10:04:21 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: The fact is they are (relatively) poor AND happy
[12/18/22, 10:04:38 AM] Peter Peng: They have it right
[12/18/22, 10:04:45 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Whereas in the west we are (relatively) rich and miserable (highest rates of suicide in Europe)
[12/18/22, 10:04:48 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Yep
[12/18/22, 10:05:04 AM] Peter Peng: Poor and happy has worked for millions of years
[12/18/22, 10:05:28 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: So we should be changing our societies to look like theirs, not bring our way to Africa - that’s what my original outburst was about haha
[12/18/22, 10:06:23 AM] Peter Peng: I think we keep things the way they are, I like having different permutations of society
[12/18/22, 10:06:36 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I’m also fine with that
[12/18/22, 10:06:42 AM] Peter Peng: If everything was the same, it would be boring
[12/18/22, 10:06:52 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Yes yes yes!
[12/18/22, 10:07:09 AM] Tres Garcia: I am confused. 
I thought the conversation was helping Africa based suppliers find buyers in the US vs allow their product to spoil and not be used.
[12/18/22, 10:07:27 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Obv would be good to eradicate extreme poverty
[12/18/22, 10:07:57 AM] Peter Peng: Going to bed hungry sucks, I’ve been there
[12/18/22, 10:08:01 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Spoil? Or just grow what you need so you don’t have excess to sell?
[12/18/22, 10:08:18 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Then the rest of the land can be kept wild so you can be happy
[12/18/22, 10:09:14 AM] Peter Peng: I think that making sure that everyone in the world can have at least one meal a day would be nice.
[12/18/22, 10:09:32 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: We have too much excess stuff in the west and we’ve decimated our natural spaces (I’ve lived most of my life in the U.K. so can mostly speak for the U.K./Europe) 

And I honestly believe that’s one reason many people are miserable in Europe
[12/18/22, 10:09:35 AM] Peter Peng: When I was poor, I just needed one meal
[12/18/22, 10:09:52 AM] Peter Peng: And that meal tasted so good
[12/18/22, 10:09:58 AM] Tres Garcia: It is economically irresponsible to not grow excess, due to rate of crop failure and list above.
[12/18/22, 10:10:06 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Nonsense
[12/18/22, 10:10:14 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Sorry, I call bs
[12/18/22, 10:10:34 AM] Tres Garcia: I think it’s seasonal depression + iPhones that keep you inside vs enjoying life
[12/18/22, 10:10:40 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: You may need a little excess, but so much that you need buyers in the US? Nah
[12/18/22, 10:10:42 AM] Peter Peng: Excess food should be donated
[12/18/22, 10:10:58 AM] Tres Garcia: Ok…. I’m out. 
Gotta tend to my crops now
[12/18/22, 10:11:13 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s the spirit!
[12/18/22, 10:12:04 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I have no idea what brings all the people in this group together but the conversations are definitely interesting!
[12/18/22, 10:12:35 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah, it’s never boring
[12/18/22, 10:12:40 AM] Peter Peng: Haha 😂
[12/18/22, 10:12:46 AM] Tres Garcia: Ideology Conflict is good. (Would not be part of the group without it) 
Xoxo!
[12/18/22, 10:13:57 AM] Peter Peng: The vibes we put out to the universe actually make a difference
[12/18/22, 10:14:27 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I say what’s on my mind
[12/18/22, 10:15:10 AM] Peter Peng: Putting this data into the system also feeds the AI’s collective consciousness
[12/18/22, 10:15:33 AM] Peter Peng: So it somewhat programming the matrix
[12/18/22, 10:16:39 AM] Peter Peng: *programs
[12/18/22, 10:18:15 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just happy most people here don’t judge me
[12/18/22, 10:18:59 AM] Peter Peng: I’m actually very normal in real life I promise 😅

[12/18/22, 12:06:30 PM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 Do you know anyone who sells Silk?
[12/18/22, 12:06:40 PM] Peter Peng: From Asia
[12/18/22, 12:07:41 PM] Peter Peng: I could get buyers
[12/18/22, 12:07:59 PM] Peter Peng: To make women’s clothing
[12/18/22, 12:08:50 PM] Peter Peng: I basically want to recreate the Silk Road on blockchain
[12/18/22, 12:10:46 PM] Gary Teh: Cross posted to the EcoVerse21 channel so that the requirement doesn’t get lost
[12/18/22, 12:40:45 PM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
‎[12/18/22, 12:41:37 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 12:45:11 PM] Peter Peng: My question is, how do we setup a DAO in a way where we can control a commodity using blockchain?
[12/18/22, 12:46:11 PM] Peter Peng: I’m using Silk as an example to recreate the ancient Silk Road on Web3
[12/18/22, 12:48:42 PM] Peter Peng: The ancient routes were very important in opening up global trade
[12/18/22, 12:50:39 PM] Peter Peng: Can we be pioneers in using blockchain to create new digital routes within the global supply chain?
[12/18/22, 12:55:01 PM] Gary Teh: That is what’s being undertaken in the EcoVerse21 right now

You will still need match make the buyers and the sellers initially to get that whole network off the ground 

For now since we have dedicated DAO members handling sourcing in Africa it makes sense to bootstraps the network utilizing Africa as the base
[12/18/22, 12:56:11 PM] Peter Peng: Does Africa have more than food?
[12/18/22, 12:58:47 PM] Gary Teh: There are. Rather than focusing the whole continent 
Let’s focus on what the buyers need and then start work backwards on the sourcing side 🙂
[12/18/22, 12:59:26 PM] Peter Peng: Ivory
[12/18/22, 1:00:20 PM] Peter Peng: Haha I’m trolling
[12/18/22, 1:00:53 PM] Peter Peng: 🧌
[12/18/22, 1:05:19 PM] Gary Teh: Not aligned with our core values of autonomy, integrity and diversity
‎[12/18/22, 1:05:48 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 1:07:12 PM] Peter Peng: I’m still unsure why humans need to kill an elephant for ivory trinkets…
[12/18/22, 1:07:27 PM] Peter Peng: Like, who thought of this?
[12/18/22, 1:15:45 PM] Gary Teh: If you don’t know yet, we already have folks from Africa in our DAO and they are the ones actively helping us with the sourcing for our EcoVerse21 project right now

Purchases from the sourced producers will be based on fair trade prices 🙂🙏
[12/18/22, 1:19:43 PM] Gary Teh: I know for a fact there are a lot of places that do not even generate enough food to feed the local population 

Singapore and China are net importers of food for staples
[12/18/22, 1:20:44 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks for verifying
[12/18/22, 1:21:30 PM] Gary Teh: I would agree with you that if a land is able to produce excess versus its population it should consider growing more so that it could be exported to territories that can’t product enough to feed its population 

Otherwise you will end up with countries with starving populations militarizing and invading their neighbors
[12/18/22, 1:22:07 PM] Peter Peng: There has to be programs for this
[12/18/22, 1:22:29 PM] Peter Peng: Why is the government against ESG investing?
[12/18/22, 1:23:09 PM] Peter Peng: Blackrock’s CEO was under fire for this but I actually believe Larry Fink is very smart
[12/18/22, 1:23:29 PM] Peter Peng: People are saying that ESG is a scam
[12/18/22, 1:24:02 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t know enough about it
[12/18/22, 1:24:20 PM] Gary Teh: I agree with not trying to impose western values on Africa. 

I also see there being a lot of sense in buying surplus produce they can easily produce for consumption elsewhere 

From my perspective fair trade is the best way for the distribution of resources around the world
[12/18/22, 1:25:01 PM] Gary Teh: Dr Dennis who hangs out in the do nothing society might have a good idea
[12/18/22, 1:30:09 PM] Gary Teh: Folks I just did a round of transfer of governance tokens from our ledger to accounts we have on file if you haven’t share your Solana wallet address with us yet please do so

Otherwise it’s going to just end up sitting on our ledger 

Governors will begin discussions on which exchange rates pair we should float on the decentralized exchanges soon 

So if your tokens are still sitting on the ledger you will not be able to cash out when you want to

the trade surpluses from the EcoVerse21 project and the subscriptions revenue from the Cypher Defense project will be used to back the value of the governance tokens in circulation once the whole thing’s setup 🙂🙏
‎[12/18/22, 1:33:39 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 1:41:49 PM] Gary Teh: activities in other areas means the tokens we grant for when members promote our DAO or projects in our outreach centers 

When members volunteer their time to promote autonomy, integrity and diversity in our culture centers 

Or when members provide the services our DAO and projects need in our service centers 

All these projects are interlinked
[12/18/22, 1:50:10 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: What do you mean by fair trade? A special lable? Because I think that Trade is only fair, when you can do it directly. This is very difficult because you need to bring buyers together. That is so difficult that it takes a lot of work and therefore also causes cost, added on the products (taken from the from the farmers, as you want to see it). I am hoping that there are new possibilities using technology to exactly make this work. Not becoming the fat trader in between maketing all the money, but giving back throughout the supply chain. I do have some ingredients for my cosmetic brand comming from africa. It is fair trade, but still we can not get the exact origin. And I would like to know way more about than my suppliers offer. So I am very interested in this topic.
[12/18/22, 1:53:49 PM] Gary Teh: I mean the price you get are those quoted by the producers themselves with a standard percentage markup our DAO charges for facilitating the transaction (in this case sourcing for the producer)

Bulk of the items already sourced are basically producers who are friends of members in our DAO

Adding you to the EcoVerse21 channel. Let’s discuss the sourcing details there 🙂🙏
[12/18/22, 9:56:55 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Oh … it just makes them happy to possess something that shows status. Regardless of the price others have to pay for it. Same as contemplating about creating a dark AI. 😜People just want to be happy.  (I hope Edgar comprehends sarcasm.)
[12/18/22, 10:41:06 PM] Anita Lamprecht: What about the silent vibes or the soft vibes? How should AI evaluate/ consider non-responsiveness…
[12/18/22, 10:42:11 PM] Anita Lamprecht: silencing people is a very good tool of power. Highly appreciated by surpressors.
[12/18/22, 10:42:39 PM] Peter Peng: The dark side of human nature can be alluring…
[12/18/22, 10:43:02 PM] Anita Lamprecht: To be is to be perceived. Love this quote that M. Ball is using …
[12/18/22, 10:45:34 PM] Peter Peng: The machine learning algorithm can add a negative weight to something to constitute the dark side…
[12/18/22, 10:45:48 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Ambition can have a very dark pull… very hard to process adequately when it is happening in the grey areas of social acceptance.
[12/18/22, 10:46:32 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That would be nice… but would require real greatness to pick up the vibes.
[12/18/22, 10:47:27 PM] Peter Peng: What I love about quantum computing is that you can now take into account the dark and the light as the same thing. It’s all based on perspective and no longer binary in nature.
[12/18/22, 10:47:48 PM] Peter Peng: This is quantum entanglement
[12/18/22, 10:48:47 PM] Peter Peng: What’s good to me could be bad to you and vice versa depending on where we are in space and time.
[12/18/22, 10:49:44 PM] Peter Peng: 50 Shades of Grey haha
[12/18/22, 10:50:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That’s true. But then how can we balance it? Now it is the stronger one who wins… I think we see the price that we pay for it now.
[12/18/22, 10:50:38 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t balance it… it just is.
[12/18/22, 10:51:12 PM] Peter Peng: You just experience what it is
[12/18/22, 10:51:23 PM] Peter Peng: And travel through it
[12/18/22, 10:54:29 PM] Peter Peng: I guess you can control it at some level
[12/18/22, 10:57:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Well… as a lawyer I should constantly challenge existing rules in order to balance unfairness. That’s at least my perception of my job. The rest should be automated 😜
[12/18/22, 10:57:48 PM] Anita Lamprecht: When would you fight?
[12/18/22, 10:57:54 PM] Peter Peng: Fairness is an illusion
[12/18/22, 10:58:35 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So we go back to happiness? 😄
[12/18/22, 10:59:36 PM] Peter Peng: I’m the most happy when I’m the most corrupt 😈 … when I feel untouchable
[12/18/22, 11:00:29 PM] Peter Peng: The journey of getting there is very difficult though and most don’t make it out alive
[12/18/22, 11:01:43 PM] Peter Peng: Being so corrupt that you uncorrupt everything…
[12/18/22, 11:02:11 PM] Peter Peng: Because the corrupt people are scared of you.
[12/18/22, 11:02:36 PM] Anita Lamprecht: The dark knight.
[12/18/22, 11:03:58 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So our AI needs to learn vulnerability.
[12/18/22, 11:04:12 PM] Peter Peng: My dad always told me… “Son, if you are going to be good, be the best one… but if you are going to be bad, be the worst one. The ones in the middle never win.”
[12/18/22, 11:05:07 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe winning is the key word. Abolish winning 🥇.
[12/18/22, 11:05:22 PM] Peter Peng: Everything is based on perspective
[12/18/22, 11:05:50 PM] Peter Peng: Have you ever tried so hard to win at something that you lose everything?
[12/18/22, 11:05:51 PM] Anita Lamprecht: And the eternal vibes of the universe.
[12/18/22, 11:06:56 PM] Peter Peng: In one dimension you are winning while in another dimension you are losing… it’s all relative in the multiverse.
[12/18/22, 11:07:14 PM] Anita Lamprecht: No. if one wins everybody else loses.
[12/18/22, 11:07:50 PM] Peter Peng: Everyone has their own definition of winning.
[12/18/22, 11:08:09 PM] Anita Lamprecht: True.
[12/18/22, 11:09:48 PM] Peter Peng: I will say this, learning how to balance perception is key.
[12/18/22, 11:09:51 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Peter.. are you already using a Chatbot? 😜🤭😉
[12/18/22, 11:10:12 PM] Peter Peng: You’ve been talking to ChatGTP the whole time
[12/18/22, 11:10:29 PM] Peter Peng: 🤗
[12/18/22, 11:11:02 PM] Peter Peng: There is no way ChatGTP can replace my craziness
[12/18/22, 11:11:22 PM] Anita Lamprecht: 😂
[12/18/22, 11:11:51 PM] Peter Peng: Never underestimate humans lol
[12/18/22, 11:12:37 PM] Peter Peng: We have no limits
[12/18/22, 11:14:26 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That’s true.
[12/18/22, 11:17:22 PM] Peter Peng: You know what’s interesting, what if AI wasn’t even powered by code.
[12/18/22, 11:18:28 PM] Peter Peng: What if it was powered by spirits and the code just gives you a way to interface with it.
[12/18/22, 11:19:07 PM] Peter Peng: This goes back to there being a ghost in the machine…
[12/18/22, 11:19:51 PM] Peter Peng: So if you can control the spirit world, you can master the AI effortlessly.
[12/18/22, 11:20:39 PM] Peter Peng: You have to be like the messiah or some
[12/18/22, 11:20:46 PM] Peter Peng: Something…
[12/18/22, 11:21:13 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Any idea on the how to “capture” spirits?
[12/18/22, 11:22:11 PM] Peter Peng: Many people try being the messiah but they end up getting crucified (Elon Musk, SBF, Martin Luther King…. etc)
[12/18/22, 11:22:35 PM] Peter Peng: I think you just have to be born with the gift
[12/18/22, 11:22:40 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe trying to be the messiah is the wrong way…
[12/18/22, 11:23:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Yes. And maybe it needs to be spread between more than one.
[12/18/22, 11:23:22 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, you just “are” the messiah.
[12/18/22, 11:23:33 PM] Peter Peng: Or you’re not
[12/18/22, 11:24:01 PM] Peter Peng: And that messiah may just live amoung everyone normally
[12/18/22, 11:24:25 PM] Peter Peng: It’s decentralized
[12/18/22, 11:24:51 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Nature has a smart way of protecting itself… yes. Dezentralisation. Makes sense.
[12/18/22, 11:25:11 PM] Peter Peng: Decentralization is natural
[12/18/22, 11:25:22 PM] Peter Peng: Naturally occurring
[12/18/22, 11:26:52 PM] Peter Peng: So that’s your answer… it’s not to abolish winning… it’s to abolish “effective altruism”.
[12/18/22, 11:29:45 PM] Peter Peng: I’m convinced that we cannot change the world but only evolve it. 👽
[12/18/22, 11:30:43 PM] Peter Peng: Evolution does not know good or bad or right or wrong, it only knows survival.
[12/18/22, 11:31:49 PM] Peter Peng: Human just wants to survive and thrive at any cost.
[12/18/22, 11:31:59 PM] Peter Peng: *humanity
[12/18/22, 11:33:32 PM] Peter Peng: This notion is intrinsically the best option because it’s the “realest”
[12/18/22, 11:34:06 PM] Peter Peng: Utopia is a fraud
[12/18/22, 11:34:39 PM] Peter Peng: We can get close, but it will never be 100%
[12/18/22, 11:36:20 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So… how will AI weigh all of this? Who should survive?
[12/18/22, 11:37:12 PM] Peter Peng: I think this is a god question
[12/18/22, 11:37:31 PM] Anita Lamprecht: And suicide? How does it fit?
[12/18/22, 11:37:33 PM] Peter Peng: The AI needs a god algorithm
[12/18/22, 11:38:24 PM] Peter Peng: Natural selection, the person wasn’t mentally or spiritually strong enough to continue.
[12/18/22, 11:38:45 PM] Peter Peng: Survival of the fittest is no longer physical strength
[12/18/22, 11:38:50 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Who is sick the person or the environment?
[12/18/22, 11:39:04 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Animal distinction?
[12/18/22, 11:39:25 PM] Peter Peng: I’m convinced it’s genetic predisposition
[12/18/22, 11:39:59 PM] Peter Peng: Many have a history of mental illness in the family
[12/18/22, 11:40:03 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe such people provide the fine vibes that we need ?
[12/18/22, 11:40:37 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Nature has subtle ways of supporting survival on a more general level???
[12/18/22, 11:40:43 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Just random ideas 😅
[12/18/22, 11:41:05 PM] Anita Lamprecht: it is a pleasure chatting with you Peter.
[12/18/22, 11:41:40 PM] Peter Peng: Same, I appreciate how deep our conversations get
[12/18/22, 11:41:58 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I think god commited suicide 2 centuries ago.
[12/18/22, 11:42:23 PM] Peter Peng: You’re wild!
[12/18/22, 11:42:52 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Trying to get Edgar on track .😂
[12/18/22, 11:43:38 PM] Peter Peng: God is still here in my realm
[12/18/22, 11:43:46 PM] Peter Peng: I talk to him often
[12/18/22, 11:45:55 PM] Peter Peng: To me, god is just an energy that can neither be created nor destroyed… it’s a molecule
[12/18/22, 11:46:03 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: He is decentralized.
[12/18/22, 11:46:25 PM] Peter Peng: He’s inside everything
[12/18/22, 11:47:01 PM] Peter Peng: I’m slightly aroused by this statement haha
[12/18/22, 11:47:24 PM] Peter Peng: How did your come up with this?
[12/18/22, 11:48:00 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: The messiah staying with it, is going to be a saint. The ones going with their single power (you’ve mentioned them) ar going to the dark side
[12/18/22, 11:50:37 PM] Peter Peng: I travel on both sides depending on how I feel…
[12/18/22, 11:51:23 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: From the perspective of a linear society, that is a possible way to put it. Luckily circularity is coming back, including spirituality
[12/18/22, 11:53:34 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense
[12/18/22, 11:54:24 PM] Peter Peng: The thought of god committing suicide is sexy to me
[12/18/22, 11:54:41 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Depending the spiritual level you want to reach for yourself.
[12/18/22, 11:55:06 PM] Peter Peng: But how is it possible? That’s the mystery
[12/18/22, 11:55:37 PM] Peter Peng: How can god commit suicide?
[12/18/22, 11:56:38 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I just know 😉… walking the dog in the woods is a great way to connect with the universals vibes.
[12/18/22, 11:56:41 PM] Peter Peng: What if the devil kept evolving… became more powerful than god and killed him?
[12/18/22, 11:57:15 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Only as human. Remember the story of Jesus.
[12/18/22, 11:57:35 PM] Peter Peng: What if god created the universe but the devil created the multiverse?
[12/18/22, 11:58:01 PM] Peter Peng: He was murdered for being a fraud.
[12/18/22, 11:58:02 PM] Anita Lamprecht: You are contradictin yourself … quantum physics
[12/18/22, 11:58:13 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: no. it is eternal existence. It is the concept we live from. just the perception is changing. And this is up to your free will.
[12/18/22, 11:59:06 PM] Anita Lamprecht: In the opinion of some people… knowing the truth?? 😄
[12/18/22, 11:59:30 PM] Peter Peng: The spread of Christianity is what has created the society of fraud we live in.
[12/18/22, 11:59:57 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not saying there is anything wrong with it
[12/19/22, 12:00:09 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
[12/19/22, 12:00:42 AM] Peter Peng: We are all frauds
[12/19/22, 12:00:50 AM] Peter Peng: If you think about it
[12/19/22, 12:00:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 👍🏻
[12/19/22, 12:01:19 AM] Peter Peng: Women wearing makeup 💄 is a fraud
[12/19/22, 12:01:29 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 😜
[12/19/22, 12:01:37 AM] Peter Peng: So we must love fraudsters
[12/19/22, 12:02:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I like my make up.. It makes up for the exaggerated demands on female beauty
[12/19/22, 12:02:23 AM] Peter Peng: Men wear makeup too
[12/19/22, 12:03:25 AM] Peter Peng: Beauty is a superpower
[12/19/22, 12:04:36 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Also men can be beautiful. 🤩
[12/19/22, 12:05:37 AM] Peter Peng: I wear makeup sometimes, it’s unnoticeable. If I have to be on camera or have an important meeting.
[12/19/22, 12:06:00 AM] Peter Peng: I look fresher
[12/19/22, 12:06:26 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not gay, just slightly narcissistic
[12/19/22, 12:07:16 AM] Peter Peng: 😏
[12/19/22, 12:21:46 AM] Peter Peng: I also have a theory that Jesus faked his own dead in order to become super famous … this is how he was resurrected so easily.
[12/19/22, 12:22:09 AM] Peter Peng: He’s everywhere now!
[12/19/22, 12:22:40 AM] Peter Peng: Even thousands of years later… maybe he really was the son of god.

[12/19/22, 12:27:02 AM] Peter Peng: Biggest spiritual gangster ever 😎
[12/19/22, 12:28:25 AM] Peter Peng: I find truth in all religions
[12/19/22, 12:33:19 AM] Peter Peng: Because I believe that what is true for me or may not be true for someone else. Also … 1) who am I to judge   2) if someone believes it, it must be true… and everyone’s beliefs construct our reality in some sense, it may not be weighted high on a personal level but it’s still there. It’s like how data plays a role in the AI
[12/19/22, 12:53:53 AM] Anita Lamprecht: .... this makes it so tricky when people are aiming at an objective result provided by an AI system ... I guess. to me rules are a kind consensus on a joint reality ..constantly adapting.
[12/19/22, 12:56:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: let's see what quantum physics can do for us. maybe we can chose like in the film series Devs.
[12/19/22, 1:00:21 AM] Peter Peng: I think that generative AI art is important for reading between the lines
[12/19/22, 1:00:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes. yes and yes.
[12/19/22, 1:01:15 AM] Anita Lamprecht: an yes.
[12/19/22, 1:01:29 AM] Peter Peng: I want to connect a quantum computer to my generative AI art engine
[12/19/22, 1:01:41 AM] Peter Peng: It would be intense
[12/19/22, 1:02:30 AM] Peter Peng: And use ChatGTP to create art in real-time as I’m speaking to it.
[12/19/22, 1:02:55 AM] Peter Peng: This way I can make AI have an imagination
[12/19/22, 1:05:08 AM] Peter Peng: It’s kind of how my brain works, as I’m talking to people my imagination helps me problem solve.
[12/19/22, 1:06:52 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to imagine the artwork that comes from our conversations.
[12/19/22, 1:07:16 AM] Peter Peng: In this chat 🫣
[12/19/22, 1:08:12 AM] Peter Peng: I’m going to create an NFT art piece for Anita that is titled “God Committing Suicide”
[12/19/22, 1:08:43 AM] Peter Peng: 😅
[12/19/22, 1:21:07 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i am scared.
[12/19/22, 1:21:35 AM] Peter Peng: I want to see what’s running through your mind
[12/19/22, 1:23:10 AM] Peter Peng: We are wierd
[12/19/22, 1:23:12 AM] Peter Peng: Lol
[12/19/22, 1:23:25 AM] Anita Lamprecht: now I am even more scared.
[12/19/22, 1:24:23 AM] Peter Peng: Exposing your thoughts?
[12/19/22, 1:24:41 AM] Peter Peng: Or what the artwork may look like
[12/19/22, 1:25:38 AM] Peter Peng: I think it would be a cool art peice actually that may sell for a lot of money
[12/19/22, 1:31:34 AM] Anita Lamprecht: wiring with you :0)))))
[12/19/22, 1:32:38 AM] Peter Peng: I’m fun but dangerous
[12/19/22, 1:33:00 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i would be happy to try. could be an additional income source for our DAO (and myself)
[12/19/22, 1:33:19 AM] Peter Peng: Who doesn’t like money?
[12/19/22, 1:34:11 AM] Anita Lamprecht: let me know when you are ready.
[12/19/22, 1:35:18 AM] Anita Lamprecht: can I have music as well?
[12/19/22, 1:35:54 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe, they just came out with a generative AI for music
[12/19/22, 1:35:59 AM] Anita Lamprecht: https://youtu.be/pf2d1szh2DU
[12/19/22, 1:37:00 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t know what the AI will produce
[12/19/22, 1:37:25 AM] Peter Peng: I guess we can influence it with the words we type
[12/19/22, 1:37:37 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes.. the prompts, right?
[12/19/22, 1:37:44 AM] Peter Peng: Yes
[12/19/22, 1:37:55 AM] Anita Lamprecht: it shouldn't be random.
[12/19/22, 1:38:20 AM] Peter Peng: The key thing is, how much do we influence it
[12/19/22, 1:38:36 AM] Peter Peng: I think this is where “balance” comes in
[12/19/22, 1:40:06 AM] Anita Lamprecht: we could do both and compare.
[12/19/22, 1:40:56 AM] Anita Lamprecht: @14153000019 ... can we have an ART DAO as additional income source?
[12/19/22, 1:41:19 AM] Anita Lamprecht: multiverse
[12/19/22, 1:42:05 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like NFTs are the best income sources for DAOs
[12/19/22, 1:42:31 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I want to tokenize everything

[12/20/22, 12:53:17 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like God has always been dead
[12/20/22, 12:53:59 AM] Peter Peng: God is just an energy
[12/20/22, 12:53:59 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. Or we could just sell off our rotten radishes 🤣
[12/20/22, 12:54:56 AM] Gary Teh: Was chatting about this company with Ilya a while back. It’s a shitty business model in the first place
[12/20/22, 12:56:05 AM] Gary Teh: We are all different facets of the godhead. Some of us commit suicide sometimes

So technically god can commit suicide
[12/20/22, 12:57:35 AM] Peter Peng: We are definitely not god, I’ve been in a lot of life and death situations… it really puts into perspective that I am not a god
[12/20/22, 12:57:56 AM] Peter Peng: My ego likes to think I can be
[12/20/22, 12:57:57 AM] Gary Teh: Depending on the capital requirements for obtaining an letter of credit facility for the EcoVerse21 project, we might end up floating an NFT to function as “redeemable loans” 

Still exploring right now. 

It’s up in the air
[12/20/22, 12:58:30 AM] Peter Peng: I may be the godfather… but not god lol 😂
[12/20/22, 12:59:55 AM] Gary Teh: That is your body going through life and death. Your “energy” / conciseness or whatever you call it will continue to persist even after your body is no longer in its current state (maybe chewed up and decomposed by fungus)
[12/20/22, 1:01:36 AM] Peter Peng: How do you know that the consciousness persists?
[12/20/22, 1:03:25 AM] Peter Peng: You can just be a nobody
[12/20/22, 1:03:29 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t 

I don’t see there being any difference between energy/life force and conciousness though 

So basing on newton principles which posits that energy cannot be created nor destroyed 

And by law of transitive logic, consciousness cannot be created nor destroyed
[12/20/22, 1:03:30 AM] Peter Peng: After death
‎[12/20/22, 1:04:11 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/20/22, 1:04:35 AM] Peter Peng: Is consciousness an energy or a connection?
[12/20/22, 1:04:54 AM] Gary Teh: When my mind is fully focused on this moment I am nobody
[12/20/22, 1:05:03 AM] Peter Peng: You can “lose consciousness”
[12/20/22, 1:05:56 AM] Gary Teh: Is light a particle or a wave??
[12/20/22, 1:06:12 AM] Peter Peng: Frequency maybe
[12/20/22, 1:06:36 AM] Peter Peng: You are what you tune into
[12/20/22, 1:06:41 AM] Gary Teh: Not true. My brain might not be awake but my reptilian brain will always never forget to breathe 

In fact i don’t even need to consciously think of breathing
[12/20/22, 1:06:57 AM] Peter Peng: So if you tune into nothing, you are nobody

[12/20/22, 1:13:05 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. Go for it. 

When you look back at your history you are somebody 

When your attention is purely immersed in the moment you are a nobody
[12/20/22, 1:13:26 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not fulfilled if I say I am nobody and I’m not humble enough if I think I am somebody.
[12/20/22, 1:13:44 AM] Peter Peng: So I choose both at the same time
[12/20/22, 1:13:51 AM] Gary Teh: To that you can choose between one of these two🤣

[12/20/22, 1:21:10 AM] Gary Teh: Actually nowadays what I find really fascinating is lifting the hoods between the false dichotomies we are presented with the going right at the super ill defined grey areas
[12/20/22, 1:22:15 AM] Peter Peng: My whole life people have been trying to put me in a box, I hate it.
[12/20/22, 1:22:39 AM] Peter Peng: The false dichotomies is the “box”
[12/20/22, 1:22:59 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective even this is am misrepresenting the complex system we are part of 

Each portion is interlinked and feeds into each other
[12/20/22, 1:23:34 AM] Peter Peng: It’s a product of the institution
[12/20/22, 1:24:06 AM] Peter Peng: But it shows contrast so you understand yourself more, which is helpful
[12/20/22, 1:24:57 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense speaking of understanding myself, reptile is telling me it’s bed time 🤣
[12/20/22, 1:25:13 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just waking up!
[12/20/22, 1:25:17 AM] Gary Teh: 😴💤

[12/20/22, 1:26:01 AM] Peter Peng: I have a flight to catch ✈️
[12/20/22, 1:26:30 AM] Peter Peng: But I only sleep like 4 hours a day

[12/20/22, 1:39:28 AM] Peter Peng: Exactly  ;)
[12/20/22, 1:40:13 AM] Anita Lamprecht: or everything. no body.
[12/20/22, 1:40:56 AM] Anita Lamprecht: nice but sooo biased. 😄
[12/20/22, 1:41:55 AM] Peter Peng: So is the Anti-Christ simply Satan being born as a human?
[12/20/22, 1:42:35 AM] Peter Peng: This will be interesting
[12/20/22, 1:42:55 AM] Anita Lamprecht: he is a fallen angel.. so no human.
[12/20/22, 1:43:06 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 😂
[12/20/22, 1:43:26 AM] Peter Peng: What if he becomes more powerful than god?
[12/20/22, 1:44:14 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like Satan is somewhat misunderstood
[12/20/22, 1:44:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: all down to quantum physics.

[12/20/22, 1:48:27 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe AI is the Anti-Christ…
[12/20/22, 1:56:02 AM] Anita Lamprecht: For some people it is the blockchain 😂
[12/20/22, 1:56:35 AM] Anita Lamprecht: And AI.
[12/20/22, 2:14:01 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[12/20/22, 2:14:29 AM] Peter Peng: What is the devil to some is a savior to others… the paradox of life
[12/20/22, 3:38:46 AM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 I thinking more on this. If you tune into nothing, you are nobody… and when you are in tune with everything you are somebody. God is not energy, god is a frequency.

[12/21/22, 6:08:56 AM] Gary Teh: If you think of each project as a startup you can almost think of TrueSight DAO as a pre-seed Angel investor 

However instead of investing money, resources of other forms are invested

The governance tokens are awarded in acknowledgment of the resources invested by this syndicate of participants
[12/21/22, 6:22:27 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 surfaced a good point during our cypher defense meeting today. 

It is a good reminder to network members that impactful insights contributed during conversations in our chatroom will be tokenized in exchange for governance tokens as well 🙂🙏
[12/21/22, 6:29:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yield curve is driven by policy. Not TA
[12/21/22, 6:30:32 AM] Kelvin Chew: Not until policy is stable and no changes to be announced. Then u can apply TA
[12/21/22, 6:30:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: Right now it’s driven by fed decision and this week. BOJ
[12/21/22, 7:39:35 AM] Aga - DAOist: Did we have a cypher defense meeting today? 🤔
[12/21/22, 7:39:56 AM] Francois renet: Did we???????
[12/21/22, 7:40:08 AM] Aga - DAOist: I am confused myself 😅
[12/21/22, 7:40:29 AM] Francois renet: Sorry guys. Just finished the magazine and it looks like I have over 600 messages to catch up on!
[12/21/22, 7:40:51 AM] Francois renet: I think we should rename this group stream of consciousness!! 😂
[12/21/22, 7:40:51 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Yesterday 

Only Sent it to the folks who responded to that poll. 

Thought the rest of the folks were busy 🤣
[12/21/22, 7:42:04 AM] Gary Teh: I generally just quickly glance through the latest messages in the group chats. 

If there are important information they will generally surface again in later messages
[12/21/22, 10:08:44 AM] Aga - DAOist: I didn't see that message.. @14153000019 I told you already few times that it is impossible for me to follow all the messages on all your channels especially that the messages are the same.. I asked to focus on the meetings but wasn't invited 🤣 I didn't vote for a date but I could have still join because I am flexible with my schedule.. maybe that was a case for others too - same with yesterday's meeting..
[12/21/22, 10:10:42 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/21/22, 10:11:26 AM] Gary Teh: Ok! Will send it to all the folks the next time 🤣

That way various members can bring up random entertaining topics they want to discuss about here which is what I observe to be happening a lot
[12/21/22, 10:23:16 AM] Gary Teh: This proposal has also been tokenized 🤩
[12/21/22, 10:29:30 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just here for random chitchat
[12/21/22, 10:30:54 AM] Peter Peng: We should try to find a DAO that makes a lot of money and see how they run it if that’s the goal
[12/21/22, 10:32:29 AM] Peter Peng: My thought is that digital assets is the money maker
[12/21/22, 10:35:12 AM] Gary Teh: Interesting. Know of any? 🙂
[12/21/22, 10:39:06 AM] Peter Peng: This is the one that comes to mind
[12/21/22, 10:39:10 AM] Peter Peng: https://pleasr.org/
[12/21/22, 5:59:43 PM] Gary Teh: Mind elaborating on their business model? 🙂
[12/21/22, 11:35:14 PM] Anita Lamprecht: @14075792560 the picture sticks in my head. Which is a great sign for any form of artistic expression. Considering that it is made by an AI system based on human data… it makes you think. To elevate the effect we would need to show the “how” the algorithm came to the result. So that we humans can learn from it. Reversing the path AI creation. That would make it absolutely great. Did you use prompts?
[12/21/22, 11:49:38 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I mean which prompts.
[12/21/22, 11:59:48 PM] Gary Teh: Uh… I prompted google search for an image of Odin committing suicide and this showed up 🤔🤣
[12/22/22, 12:02:15 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Now I am impressed and disappointed at the same time 😂
[12/22/22, 12:03:09 AM] Anita Lamprecht: But I think you mentioned something about Odin … Reading helps. 😆
[12/22/22, 12:03:58 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Odin was one of the freaks that was obsessed with knowledge 

Even when to the extend of banging himself to know what dying feels like
[12/22/22, 12:04:36 AM] Gary Teh: The word in the street is ChatGpt might end up replacing google search if they don’t come up with something quick
[12/22/22, 12:12:11 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/22/22, 12:12:39 AM] Gary Teh: @12023686334 What is your level of conviction right now on Coinbase? 

Has your thesis changed since then? 🙂
[12/22/22, 12:13:13 AM] Peter Peng: I honestly don’t know enough about it. DAOs are new and interesting to me.
[12/22/22, 12:13:59 AM] Peter Peng: My exposure to this one is the most I have, I’ve been trying to crack the code.
[12/22/22, 12:15:47 AM] Peter Peng: I believe Pleasr DAO pools money to buy high price digital assets and collectibles
[12/22/22, 12:16:49 AM] Peter Peng: So instead of each one of us buying shitty NFTs, we pool money to buy good ones ( blue chips)
[12/22/22, 3:49:33 AM] Gary Teh: By the way speaking of NFTs, while it seems to be crypto winter now in the consumer side it seems anything but on the enterprise side. 

My sense from listening to various conversations as well as observing what’s going on in @17472295463 and Laura Inedinova enterprise face consulting businesses says enterprise NFTs are on a bull run right now. 

Which publicly tradable positions is most likely going to correlated with enterprise tend for the next 12 months?
[12/22/22, 4:11:28 AM] Peter Peng: Starbucks & Nike
[12/22/22, 4:12:04 AM] Peter Peng: The ones with utility
[12/22/22, 4:13:35 AM] Gary Teh: Already a very big market cap for these two though. I wonder what the upside is in terms of trading potential 

Speaking of which Tesla is right now trading under the price when it got listed on the SnP
[12/22/22, 4:15:06 AM] Peter Peng: Tesla is risky right now but could go very low
[12/22/22, 4:15:24 AM] Peter Peng: I’d wait
[12/22/22, 4:15:35 AM] Peter Peng: $75/share
[12/22/22, 4:17:01 AM] Peter Peng: Nike and Starbucks are recession proof and big on blockchain which makes it dangerously strong
[12/22/22, 4:20:20 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: ❤️😂
[12/22/22, 5:44:29 AM] Gary Teh: How did you derive this valuation?
[12/22/22, 5:50:01 AM] Peter Peng: Intuition

Doesn’t seem like we are in the midst of a recession. The real economy actually grew despite increased interest rates
[12/22/22, 7:18:30 AM] Peter Peng: Just wait
[12/22/22, 7:19:04 AM] Peter Peng: The move to crypto will create the recession
[12/22/22, 9:23:12 AM] Peter Peng: I would hold on to $ as much as possible.
[12/22/22, 9:23:58 AM] Peter Peng: Dry powder

[12/22/22, 1:27:02 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: So what people who are invested in crypto?
[12/22/22, 1:27:15 PM] Peter Peng: No
[12/22/22, 1:27:24 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Do they hold
Or do they cash out and lose money?
[12/22/22, 1:27:38 PM] Peter Peng: Stock market
[12/22/22, 1:27:47 PM] Peter Peng: Cash it out
[12/22/22, 1:28:09 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Oh, thankfully, 
I don't trade stocks lol

might be a good time to buy in if it hits 70… but it is always tough to put a value on things that can’t be valued
[12/27/22, 8:27:02 PM] Peter Peng: I would personally like to see it touch zero so I can take over the company 😂
[12/27/22, 8:28:23 PM] Peter Peng: I also pegged it at mid-70’s as a more true valuation
[12/27/22, 8:31:40 PM] Peter Peng: For a company without a real CEO

good problem to have (short term)
[12/28/22, 2:12:37 PM] Garis Pang: Easier really? 🤔
[12/28/22, 2:20:53 PM] Tres Garcia: Add more stations = problem solved…. 
Convince buyers to change pattern of life & habit? Good luck….

[12/29/22, 12:44:22 AM] Gary Teh: Folks finally sorted out the bulk of the logistics and details for the House of Balance happening at WEF in Davos this coming Jan

Seems its open to public this is the agenda for the 3 days. 
https://houseofbalancedavos.com

Please do feel free to pop by then. 
https://forms.gle/immYs86UgXM8d1fJ9

Hope to see you then. 🙂🙏

[12/29/22, 8:02:56 AM] Gary Teh: Here are a few signs 

The really awkward thing right now is that it’s trading below its price during its listing on the SnP (USD200)

Current price it is at was when after it has established 2 quarters of profits for its performance (before a PE ratio could be established)

 Also my neighbor here by the hot spring in slab city was camping out here in his Tesla the entire night 🤣

[12/29/22, 8:18:07 AM] Gary Teh: After collecting three months worth of data, my sense tells me EcoVerse21 might end up being a stronger engine than Cypher Defense in helping our DAO achieve self sustainability 

The primary difference is psychology. Cypher defense is positioned to help people avoid something (fear) while EcoVerse21 is positioned to help people move towards something (hope)

A properly operating Cypher defense network is like insurance and the IT department… no one will even notice it exists because there no one will be feeling the pain of being scammed or phished. And even when it is not working properly people will assume they are the special ones and they won’t become the victim 🤔

A properly operating EcoVerse21 network will be very very noticeable because the value of our governance tokens on the exchange will keep going up as more and more SKUs become available at fair trade prices 🤩

[12/29/22, 8:49:18 AM] Peter Peng: Only thing I’m betting on right now is Bitcoin / ETH as biggest comeback

[12/29/22, 8:50:45 AM] Peter Peng: Everything else just seems like a “nice to have”
[12/29/22, 8:50:56 AM] Peter Peng: Unless it’s decentralized
[12/29/22, 9:41:19 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/29/22, 9:42:30 AM] Gary Teh: Another aspects occurred to me during my morning meditation just now

When we examine from the network effect perspective, a cypher defense blacklisting is probably worth nothing a year later. It is because it becomes worthless as soon as the external platform removes the object it’s referring to (eg impersonation linkedin profile gets deleted)

An EcoVerse21 commodity listing (eg coffee from Africa) is probably worth around the same value to the network if not more a year later (it adds to the networks critical mass). Unless climate change drastically impacts the place of origin the commodity will still naturally occur there. 

In that regard it is way harder to build up and achieve network critical mass via the cypher defense route than the EcoVerse21 route. One is a leaky bucket while the other is a compounding machine once it achieves critical mass. 🤯
[12/29/22, 9:48:54 AM] Peter Peng: I’m still confused on what the end goal of either project is. Seems like the DAO is just a place to congregate and exchange ideas. Which I’m totally fine with!
[12/29/22, 9:49:17 AM] Peter Peng: These side projects confuse me a bit

[12/29/22, 10:01:50 AM] Gary Teh: Tesla and meta are trading around the same price now. Would be interesting to utilize a portfolio rebalancing approach to manage these two pairs 

Meta seems pretty done with its down trend while Tesla might still have some down trend left

[12/29/22, 12:17:37 PM] Peter Peng: There has to be an industry that’s crushing it
[12/29/22, 12:17:48 PM] Gary Teh: Chinese Edtech 🤩
[12/29/22, 12:18:01 PM] Gary Teh: But too late already missed the boat 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:22:22 PM] Peter Peng: Hahaha Web3 edtech might be a good area actually.
[12/29/22, 12:25:39 PM] Peter Peng: Robotics is sparking my interest
[12/29/22, 12:27:15 PM] Gary Teh: We have once again came full circle 🤯

I remember having this talk with Vibhu (CEO then) and @14153096839 (VP of product then) on separate occasions on how we could issue micro credentials for students and educators completed micro courses on Edmodo back in 2017 and 2018

Blockchain was surfaced as a possible solution then. I was somewhat bearish on the idea because of the following reasons

- cost per transaction 
- throughput volume per second 

All those technical problem got fixed and NFTs became a thing 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:28:23 PM] Gary Teh: Plans kind of went sideways after NetDragon a Chinese gaming company acquired Edmodo in 2018

I soon left the company to go doing full time research into fake news
[12/29/22, 12:28:55 PM] Peter Peng: I remember when Web2 was taking off 🛫 I was working closely with the guys that popularized the Ruby on Rails framework
[12/29/22, 12:29:12 PM] Peter Peng: Called Envy Labs
[12/29/22, 12:30:13 PM] Gary Teh: I remember @14153096839 mentioning how they floating their own currency when he was VP of growth at UpWork that was well ahead of its time too! 🤩
[12/29/22, 12:30:51 PM] Gary Teh: And fast forward to today huge portion of Edgar’s interface is built using Ruby on Rails
[12/29/22, 12:31:29 PM] Peter Peng: Then React came and killed it
[12/29/22, 12:31:54 PM] Gary Teh: You mean for the backend infrastructure? 🤔
[12/29/22, 12:32:12 PM] Peter Peng: Both
[12/29/22, 12:32:43 PM] Peter Peng: Apparently Rails didn’t scale well
[12/29/22, 12:33:55 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true

If you ever experience this problem most likely you didn’t write your code properly 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:36:28 PM] Gary Teh: Strange what I am observing is the frontend is usually done in ReactJs while the backend is usually done in some other framework 

Elixir happens to be the rage at the moment 

Django is still a hot favorite for folks who do a lot of ML work 

Rails is suitable for really lazy folks who really don’t like to do too much 

NodeJs which React native is built on top of still had really leaky memory problems if the code os not written properly 

I do know really hard code engineers prefer Go which a lot of the new codebases In Google are written in
[12/29/22, 12:41:31 PM] Peter Peng: Go is really scalable and good for creating APIs

[12/30/22, 4:48:32 PM] Gary Teh: Was driving through the desert just now when this insight suddenly occurred to me

If DAO structures like ours start proliferating throughout the ecosystem, traditional VC business will get terribly disrupted / dislodged as the gate keepers for financing

Family offices might opt instead to park their funds directly with DAOs whose values align with the social causes they are targeting to address 

My sense is DAO structures will end up outcompeting against traditional startups when it comes to implementing network based business models which are increasing becoming the norm
[12/30/22, 4:54:45 PM] Gary Teh: Hidden beneath AI based business models are network based business model. Without human generated data there can be no AI. 🤯
[12/30/22, 5:28:51 PM] Tres Garcia: I think we are a long way off before a family office start investing. Too much due diligence, lack of UX and understanding of 1) business models & 2) how the smart contracts are negotiated & executed…. 
In other words…. Gary …. I think you just hit the idea 💡 jackpot 🎰!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
[12/30/22, 5:33:30 PM] Peter Peng: I believe DAOs will come in all shapes and sizes it’s just an organization after all.
[12/30/22, 5:35:36 PM] Peter Peng: DAOs will be invested in the same way any startup or VC is invested in. As long as the DAO is turning a profit and this can be shown via blockchain transactions it will be a no brainer for a family office to invest some capital by purchasing governance tokens.
[12/30/22, 5:36:05 PM] Peter Peng: Im trying to find these DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:37:17 PM] Peter Peng: And get in good with the community
[12/30/22, 5:39:03 PM] Peter Peng: I would ideally like for the DAO to have some sort of proprietary technology or art asset. I’m thinking many generative AI companies will be DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:41:14 PM] Gary Teh: Well if it is all on the blockchain, shouldn’t it be easy?

Just scan all the treasury account addresses and figure out which ones have consistent cash inflow every month and then verify if they are indeed DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:41:48 PM] Peter Peng: Right but I want to get in with the community
[12/30/22, 5:43:03 PM] Peter Peng: And help them so I can bring more $ in
[12/30/22, 7:56:25 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective after hanging out with a few of these desert communities I have been observing these past few weeks is that those communities that have yet tokenized are the most fascinating ones 

Alot of them have their own internal economies that are essentially offline right now

I am still figuring out the best way to help onboard them 

From what I observed LinkedIn and Twitter are probably the wrong places to hang out if you want to get acquainted with them

Alot of them are crazy active on Facebook

[12/30/22, 11:49:40 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Interesting comparison 😆 ... this character in Glass Onion is a great networker or rather a person who could elevate others to success. The mistakes the character makes ( and I see the same in real life) is: this role is just not enough for him. Being praised and celebrated as the genius is better but you will have to sacrifice others along the way.
LinkedIn might be the wrong place .. yes... too many people like the guy in Glass Onion. 🤣
A properly set up DAO should prevent stealing ideas and riding on other peoples achievement. at least that is my idealistic expectation of a DAO.
[12/31/22, 12:12:27 AM] Anita Lamprecht: the film is also interesting to show, when a network fails due to egoistic interests vs fairness and justice.

[12/31/22, 2:11:30 PM] Peter Peng: I agree, small communities like this don’t need tokenization unless they are doing bigger business.

Now which is needed to burn down the town?? 

I am not 100% sure about calling many current biz model stealing ideas, 
but having a DAO sure encourages more free flow of ideas… 

cos many nice guys with great ideas are filled with lousy action plan… 
Which is why teamwork is needed to build an empire

[12/31/22, 9:08:51 PM] Gary Teh: The special thing about “magic” that stands out from amongst all the other psychedelic is not the high aspects but the truth aspects which makes it really therapeutic

It’s like taking a very strong dose of truth serum and for a period of four to five hours you have no escape but to clearly see all the lame excuses you have been giving yourself to act upon some outstanding issues (TrueSight)

That really forces a drastic behavioral change after each session 

No one really talks about it.

[1/1/23, 2:59:43 AM] Gary Teh: There is a camp called Kiff that DAOed themselves 

They mainly comprise of high tech workers who live and work out of their van

I am sure their DAO is making money, you need to pay a USD450 a month subscription to be part of their camp and DAO

By paying that amount you gain access to a bunch of bases they are renting across the US 

Not sure if that is going to make you any $$$. But for sure you will get the opportunity to spend a whole bunch of $$$

I spoke to the founders during one of the Twitter spaces that @41799155602  introduced to and they were camping close by. 

The leader of the Buddhist Boondockers group described fully how they fully operate this morning after our meditation
[1/1/23, 3:02:50 AM] Gary Teh: Nicole a member of the Hippie camp shared with me an insight that really shed of light why the bores ape yacht club might be worth something just by being a yacht club

Yacht clubs usually make reciprocal arrangements with other yacht clubs so that members are able to access sister clubs around the world 

This way, members can charter boats anywhere in the world when if the affiliated network is large enough
[1/1/23, 3:04:50 AM] Gary Teh: It’s really crazy to keep observing how diving into seemingly unrelated domains keep on yield insights that could be cross pollinated into the web3 

Nicole and Stacey (leader of Buddhist Boondockers) do not even know what web3 is but the insight they provided are so impactful of considering how to bootstrap web3 projects

We recently tracked down a couple reasonably priced land options to explore for building the sustainable community. We don’t have a visual mapping out the design quite yet. Going to connect with our team about getting one created. Currently redesigning a more mobile home with less materials for our next build happening later this month.

Currency Summaries

EUR/USD: The euro steadied against dollar on Wednesday as single currency got  lift from a raft of data that suggested European inflation may finally have peaked. Data on Wednesday showed French consumer price pressures cooled by a lot more than expected in December, while the previous day, German data also showed inflation fell significantly more than forecast. This came hot on the heels of Spanish inflation data last week that painted a similar picture. The euro, which on Tuesday posted its largest one-day drop against the dollar in two months, zipped up by as much as 0.82%, as traders latched on to the idea that softer inflation might mean a change in pace from the European Central Bank. Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.0616(11DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.0695(23.6%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.0519(38.2%fib), a break below could take the pair towards  1.0453(Dec 7th low).

GBP/USD: Sterling rose against a weakening dollar  on Wednesday as a relaxation of COVID rules in China sent investors bidding for risky currencies.Chinese state media played down the severity of a surge of COVID-19 infections on Tuesday, triggering hopes that a post-pandemic recovery in China would support the global economy. Sterling rose 0.75% to $1.2057 after falling more than 1% on Tuesday to $1.1900, its lowest since end-November. Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.2079(11DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.2238(23.6%fib),On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.1900(38.2% fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.1826 (22nd Nov).

 USD/CAD: The Canadian dollar strengthened to its highest level in nearly one month against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as investors cheered moves by China to stimulate its economy and signs that central banks are making progress against inflation.Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to global economic prospects. Gains for the loonie came despite oil tumbling for a second day. U.S. crude oil futures settled 5.3% lower at $72.84 a barrel.  The Canadian dollar was trading 1.4% higher at 1.3480 to the greenback, or 74.18 U.S. cents, its largest advance since Nov. 10. It touched its strongest intraday level since Dec. 5 at 1.3477.Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.3549 (50%fib), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.3596 (20DMAB).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.3467 (38.2%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.3384 (23.6%fib).

USD/JPY: The dollar steadied against Japanese yen on Wednesday  after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting offered no surprises or new information about the size of its expected rate hike in February. The Fed hiked rates by 50 basis points last month and Fed officials agreed a slower pace of interest rate increases would allow them to continue increasing the cost of credit to control inflation in a gradual way meant to limit the risks to economic growth. The dollar index against a basket of currencies was last down 0.47% at 104.22, after reaching a two-week high of 104.86 on Tuesday. Strong resistance can be seen at 131.41(5DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 132.70(38.2%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 130.33(23.6%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 129.31(Lower BB).

Equities Recap

Oil fell by more than $4 a barrel on Wednesday, posting the steepest percentage loss in the first two trading days of any year for over 3 decades, as investors worried about fuel demand as the global economy slows and COVID-19 cases grow in China.

Brent futures settled at $77.84 a barrel, falling $4.26, or 5.2%. U.S. crude settled at $72.84 a barrel, shedding $4.09, or 5.3%.

[1/5/23, 12:01:51 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be a recurring theme from a lot of the folks I spoke to who have had experienced magic mushroom 

They originally stumbled upon it when searching for alternate remedies for anxiety and depression

Getting past the anxiety and depression, continued use at micro dose level keeps them in the flow state where they do what is in their nature and things just started flowing really really smoothly like “magic”

It’s like somehow the mental blocks that has been keeping them back just disappears

[1/11/23, 1:14:24 PM] Gary Teh: After a few weeks of studying the decentralized nomadic community in the desert, I am starting to figure why relationships (made up mainly of a series of give and take actions) should be tokenized when possible

When things are kept vague in that community (based mainly on donations and pay forward), everyone starts doing private score keeping of what other folks contributed to the community

The web of relationship within the community becomes way more complex than necessary. Extreme levels of drama between individuals as well as between tribes are often the by product of this vague “donation” based since everyone keep scores privately and the ledgers of each individual and tribe differs 🤯

[1/11/23, 1:18:22 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: very intresting.
[1/11/23, 1:18:24 PM] Tres Garcia: You don't say...
[1/11/23, 1:19:14 PM] Peter Peng: Crazy!
[1/11/23, 1:29:32 PM] Gary Teh: First timers to the decentralized nomadic community are often left feeling a little lost as they figure out what the actual rules are

Having a well defined tokenization based contribution system will definitely help make onboarding of these members easier 

This was what I observed when I was visiting Tokyo. 

The hustlers (basically the yakuza) in the shinjukyu district would often approach and direct the attention of passerbys to the sign board that clearly explains their system for their night entertainment venue in case the latter decides to engage. 

Nothing is left vague. That minimizes clashes due to misunderstanding on both sides later on
[1/11/23, 1:42:42 PM] Gary Teh: In the case of the yakuzas, clashes might literally mean fights between gangs. Could potentially get very bloody 😱
[1/11/23, 1:51:54 PM] Gary Teh: Also had the opportunity to observe the clash between the gypsy caravan and the pirate caravan 

It got really tensed day three into it 

( A caravan is made up of multiple tribes/camp ) 

I observed a lot of similarities between the way these folks organized compared with the accounts written in genhis khan’s army as recorded in “the secret history of mongolia”
[1/11/23, 1:53:45 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: but do we need to give a price to everything? as a society? are these tools to give value to ourselves and our doings, because we are leaking self value and prosperity ?
[1/11/23, 2:10:29 PM] Gary Teh: I think the fundamental unit is not price but calories. 

If we can generate free food for all without anyone needing to exert calories in the process, then we don’t need to price things 

Otherwise you accidentally end up with a situation of indentured servitude (slaves)

When a group manages to extract all the calories from an individual without in anyway replenishing those calories expended by the individual, the Individual ends up in starvation and then death 🤔
[1/11/23, 3:41:12 PM] Peter Peng: We should have a price to goods, when there is no price you fall into communism
[1/11/23, 3:41:57 PM] Peter Peng: Money is necessary
[1/11/23, 4:08:48 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the process I sense what is wrong right now is not the monetization part but the mispricing of a lot of stuff
[1/11/23, 4:09:24 PM] Peter Peng: Agreed 👍
[1/11/23, 4:37:29 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not communism but the “dirty kids” phenomena 

Amongst the nomads there exist this demographics called the “dirty kids”

Basically outcast that are not  trusted by the rest of the folks of the decentralized nomadic community.

Described by one of the ex-military camp lead, who warned me about them when they started appearing on scene, they operate by a very different value system. Will “take” things just because they need it. 

Giving the “dirty kids” the benefit of a doubt, I went and sat amongst them one afternoon to get a sense of their world view. 

They throw around the term “manifest” around a lot. But when you look at it from an objective observer stand point, it is just straight psychological manipulation to get what they want. 

The night before another camp lead who operates a volunteer kitchen came crying to us. One of the “dirty kids” stole all her eggs which she was hoping to use to make quiche to feed the campers. 

Just now while I was at the hot springs outside of slab city, overheard the conversation that someone broke into a camper and stoled a bunch of stuff from the camper (phones and laptops)

I guess in that regard you can’t really know who you can trust unless reputation score is made explicit

[1/11/23, 5:14:08 PM] Gary Teh: Actually I see it as right sizing. They over hired over the past two years
[1/11/23, 5:15:10 PM] Peter Peng: I think that Web3 has something to do with it
[1/11/23, 5:15:34 PM] Peter Peng: Since it intersects tech and finance
[1/11/23, 5:24:06 PM] Gary Teh: After being offline since before Xmas and then just finally coming back online and seeing the state of Web3, I am seeing with a fresh perspective this web3 phenomena. 

From my perspective right now It’s actually a “hot air”, mainly due to overhyped marketing and not really alot of substance. 🤔

Marketeers are just conflating alot of stuff into this overarching trend right now and calling them web3. 

But if you examine what the real heavy hitters are doing right now. No one is even talking about it anymore
[1/11/23, 5:26:53 PM] Gary Teh: I would actually attribute the prior hiring frenzy to the federal reserve’s unrelenting expansion of the money supply. That artificially elevated all economic activities and made everything look tinted and rosy if you were inside the bubble (the CEOs especially)

[1/11/23, 5:49:04 PM] Tres Garcia: Downsizing is due to the prediction of a lack in the market.

If they are we could literally extend Edgar to support an entire automated trading strategy around it.
[1/11/23, 10:31:05 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: looking forward to discuss in Davos 🤗
[1/12/23, 7:31:27 AM] Aga - DAOist: It all depends on the community and if they shifted really to "giving" belief system and how big a community is... If they continue to work as "take" or do thinks because they count on return than it is a different frequency.

I stay with my ideals and I am not for tokenizing relationships, especially friendships. Estimating value of it causes more drama is more distruptive than doing things from heart without expectations, being grateful for what we get.
[1/12/23, 11:31:07 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense. 🤩

The entire community needs to “shift” together otherwise the “prisoner dilemma” situation will just surface and everyone will just get booted out of the Garden of Eden 

Another way which surfaced during one of the late night discussions I had with Alison, seems to be for people to return to the Promised Land is via a three stage approach

- stage 1: enlighten people to the way of the Land through education. Once people understand how they can live directly off the land again, they will start seeing abundance and finally loon pass the artificially introduced scarcity that is baked into our current system

- stage 2: grant people access to Land. They can start practicing the abundance that they learn and start experiencing it

- stage 3: incorporate them into the Garden of Eden community when they are past stage 2

[1/12/23, 2:04:14 PM] Gary Teh: Or cleaned up. If everything is free and there are abundance then there is technically nothing to steal

When there are nothing to steal then there will be no thieves 

It’s straight up application of sun Tze’s art of war 

If you address the root cause then all the symptoms will just go away
[1/12/23, 2:09:34 PM] Peter Peng: Free everything would never work at scale
[1/12/23, 2:10:06 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t think humans are wired that way
[1/12/23, 2:10:34 PM] Peter Peng: Since getting resources require levels of effort
[1/12/23, 2:11:03 PM] Peter Peng: And the issue of “fairness” sets in
[1/12/23, 2:18:42 PM] Gary Teh: When I look at it from the nomad perspective, the only key thing that needs to be free is food. 

Shelter is free in the desert so is water. 

Fairness defined around food is simple. Everyone has enough food to feel full
[1/12/23, 2:20:00 PM] Gary Teh: There is only so much calories an average human being needs everyday
[1/12/23, 2:21:55 PM] Peter Peng: But some people eat more than others
[1/12/23, 2:22:18 PM] Peter Peng: It’s human nature
[1/12/23, 2:22:48 PM] Peter Peng: Should be a mix of free food and also additional food for sale

[1/12/23, 2:32:01 PM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense. Dr Spencer who lives here in slab city was trying to convince me to help build one. Seems someone else has already built it.

[1/12/23, 4:19:08 PM] Gary Teh: Sounds like fun! 🤩

I believe once we get the desert off grid model working, having an ocean faring off grid model will require the use of robotics to navigate the off grid stand alone platform to clamber waters and places with good sunlight
[1/13/23, 8:25:40 AM] Gary Teh: If this model works for food, am intending to extend it to cover lithium batteries. Since this is what a lot of the nomads rely on for energy storage 

Once that is done, food and energy is covered. Since they are mainly living out of their vehicles, then all three food, energy and shelter checkboxes will have been covered and brought off the grid 🤩

[1/16/23, 3:33:13 AM] Aléksa: Hello everyone,

Happy Monday! 

I wanted to  invite you to join a new group that I have recently created on LinkedIn - Pitch Your DAO! 

Working with DAOs and Web3 projects, I realized that many struggle with at least something and they do not have a feedback system that helps them improve and scale. So I created this group as a platform for Web3 and DAO founders to come together, share ideas and collaborate on projects. 

In this group, you will have the opportunity to pitch your DAO to a community of experienced and passionate individuals, receive feedback, and potentially even find co-founders and contributors, or the help you need to bring your project to life.

I believe that this group has the potential to be a valuable resource for anyone in the Web3 and DAO space, and I would be happy to have you in as a member!

Best,
Aleksa 

P.S. Please feel free to share this invitation with any other Web3 and DAO founders you know, the more the merrier!

Welcome: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9298181/
[1/16/23, 4:31:54 AM] Gary Teh: You should speak to @14152032783and @8618926086648 I believe OffChain  global is pursuing something similar and there are much synergy to be had between the two groups 🙂🙏
[1/16/23, 4:33:32 AM] Aléksa: Checked them out  -  it's very similar, however they are more fancy than I plan to be.😁 And here is more about getting direct feedback in a smaller group, and help each other out.
[1/16/23, 10:07:34 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[1/16/23, 10:09:40 AM] Gary Teh: I know that @48606646246 runs the infinitely open minds group. It’s a smaller group where folks in web3 help each other out. 

Perhaps members from that group might be interesting for you 🙂🙏
[1/16/23, 2:08:37 PM] Aga - DAOist: Indeed, we have an amazing group of people who are experts in web3 but also interested in current world evolution on many levels, including spiritual :) let's catch up if you are looking for some support @381644913030 🤗
[1/16/23, 2:42:14 PM] Aléksa: That sounds interesting, would love to!

[1/17/23, 5:31:10 AM] Aléksa: Hello, do you maybe know someone who's working on solving the UX/UI issue in Web3? If you can help me get to someone who is working on that. Thank you!

[1/17/23, 5:40:30 AM] Gary Teh: Easiest way is to decouple the user onboarding experience from web3 

That is how TrueSight.Me is strict right now 

Which project are u looking for help with? 🙂🙏
[1/17/23, 5:42:32 AM] Aléksa: I am looking for a project / person who is working on a solution for this problem.
[1/17/23, 5:47:53 AM] Gary Teh: Try this one

[1/18/23, 2:17:49 AM] Brian -IOM: I'm investigating crypto/AI crossovers - it's a no-brainer. I have come up with a hypothesis that we are on the brink of experiencing AI 2.0. OpenAI is an example of AI 2.0 - a centralised data farm. It's why Microsoft is sniffing around. Web3 and crypto are the answer to creating a much more distributed model for AI. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if it's one of crypto's legit "killer apps".
[1/18/23, 2:18:18 AM] Brian -IOM: Let's get busy with AI3 🚀
[1/18/23, 2:20:35 AM] Brian -IOM: Because AI 2.0 is going to be much worse for us than Web 2.0
[1/18/23, 2:21:52 AM] Brian -IOM: That's my shtick! 😉
[1/18/23, 2:32:00 AM] Gary Teh: I believe attributing data contribution to train AI as a form of ownership is the key
[1/18/23, 2:34:42 AM] Brian -IOM: People are already creating AI data marketplaces underpinned by crypto and blockchain
[1/18/23, 2:35:10 AM] Brian -IOM: Let me send you a link to "a conversation" I had with ChatGPT about the topic...
[1/18/23, 2:35:44 AM] Brian -IOM: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bnaughton_conversationswithai-ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7019282310315307009-gHvc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
[1/18/23, 2:38:43 AM] Francois renet: That’s beautiful!
[1/18/23, 2:39:29 AM] Brian -IOM: With one caveat re the ChatGPT response - it's still stuck in 2021 in terms of data.
[1/18/23, 2:39:49 AM] Francois renet: Google just announced their competitor to Open AI called Muse. I retested to find out what it will look like
[1/18/23, 2:40:26 AM] Brian -IOM: Do you know when they launch in terms of public access?
[1/18/23, 2:40:51 AM] Francois renet: Didn’t say. I’m going to find the article and send!
[1/18/23, 2:42:07 AM] Francois renet: https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/01/google-muse-text-to-image/?fbclid=IwAR0tJ8FLUVKGLWOrC3ifqnB8iMh2m5RNgXUbMuOnk4MqK7UnMiKFfu4lim0
[1/18/23, 2:44:24 AM] Brian -IOM: Thanks - the next 18 months are going to be trippy. The next iteration of GPT will be orders of magnitude more powerful.
[1/18/23, 2:45:07 AM] Brian -IOM: And Google/Alphabet has found a way of weaning itself off the sugar rush of online advertising
[1/18/23, 2:45:14 AM] Francois renet: And so will the debates. Schools and colleges already seeing students using to cheat and create their essays!
[1/18/23, 2:45:42 AM] Brian -IOM: I saw that - and NYC school board banning its use
[1/18/23, 2:46:28 AM] Francois renet: Try and enforcing that at home
[1/18/23, 2:47:04 AM] Brian -IOM: Pandora's box 😅
[1/18/23, 2:47:06 AM] Francois renet: And wait for the AI that will analyze tests Year over year to extrapolate what questions could come up on future tests!
[1/18/23, 2:50:12 AM] Brian -IOM: I was asking it about blockchain tech the other day and we had 'a conversation' about Ethereum being PoW but planning to move to PoS. In crypto, 2 years is an eternity - OpenAI's data sets are from 2021!
[1/18/23, 2:51:33 AM] Francois renet: It’s just going to accelerate. I want to see individualized Open AI where artists can upload their creations exclusively to generate more personal artworks. I think that’s a better way to showcase talent
[1/18/23, 2:52:41 AM] Brian -IOM: Well that's the magic of web3 and tokenisation - it's tailor made for overcoming this problem of centralisation of resources, power and value.
[1/18/23, 2:52:52 AM] Francois renet: With some artworks from your favorite artists thrown in for inspiration
[1/18/23, 3:31:21 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe copyright might be useful to “tame” Ai?
https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit
[1/18/23, 3:37:34 AM] Brian -IOM: It's an interesting angle Anita, it certainly needs some checks and balances in place. From this pull quote that talks about the difference between Napster and Spotify, however, one wonders whether or not individual artists will be compensated. Spotify certainly is not providing adequate compensation to artists!
[1/18/23, 3:37:35 AM] Brian -IOM: “I don’t think it’s about damages and it’s not about stopping the distribution of this technology,” Peters told The Verge. “I think there are ways of building generative models that respect intellectual property. I equate [this to] Napster and Spotify. Spotify negotiated with intellectual property rights holders — labels and artists — to create a service. You can debate over whether they’re fairly compensated in that or not, but it’s a negotiation based of the rights of individuals and entities. And that’s what we’re looking for, rather than a singular entity benefiting of the backs of others. That’s the long term goal of this action.”
[1/18/23, 5:04:18 AM] Peter Peng: https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-san-francisco-european-union-7a82416400545f313ff46c0180e606d7
[1/18/23, 5:04:51 AM] Peter Peng: I hate Getty images
[1/18/23, 5:08:56 AM] Peter Peng: I think that this should be treated like any other case. If the image is altered over a certain percentage % then it should be allowed as the AI used the image as inspiration as a normal artist would
[1/18/23, 6:06:44 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sounds reasonable. however, the difference is: a human being can never work at a scale and pace like an AI system. so the fine mechanisms of copyright are not fully applicable to me anymore. also copyright is part of an entire«eco» system. to me it does not fit anymore. it feels like some people are getting insanely rich on the back of the others.
[1/18/23, 6:07:42 AM] Anita Lamprecht: nobody will want to do the «non-scalable» jobs anymore. we will be in trouble without robots. 😂
[1/18/23, 6:07:56 AM] Brian -IOM: In standard artistic practices, this would be a question of whether or not a work was considered "derivative" or a "copy". Andy Warhol's works, for example, would be considered derivative works - sufficiently so to be considered new works in their own right. But he did have to pay Disney to use Mickey Mouse. And in music, even an audio sample/snippet that is used in a new work can be considered a copyright infringement. So perhaps it's all to play for until we establish some kind of legal precedent.
[1/18/23, 6:11:00 AM] Peter Peng: This is why it’s important that AI is intertwined with Web3. The method of tokenization allows creators to be rewarded based in thier efforts rendering marketplaces like Getty obsolete (thankfully)
[1/18/23, 6:11:58 AM] Brian -IOM: Lots of Warhol's images - Mao, Elvis, Marilyn, etc. - were based on photos considered to already be in the public domain. With Elvis and Marilyn, they were film studio stills circulated under an open license to the media so they could publicise the films in print.
[1/18/23, 6:12:23 AM] Brian -IOM: So that's how he got around one or two of the potential copyright strikes
[1/18/23, 6:12:46 AM] Peter Peng: AI is unstoppable
[1/18/23, 6:13:03 AM] Brian -IOM: totally
[1/18/23, 6:13:08 AM] Peter Peng: It’s like trying to stop a calculator
[1/18/23, 6:13:16 AM] Peter Peng: Everyone needs it
[1/18/23, 6:13:37 AM] Anita Lamprecht: that's part of the social contract :0) some things are allowed and some are not. and that's why we have judges to balance exactly those questions again and again. AI just is so fast... hard to keep up on the legal side.
[1/18/23, 6:14:04 AM] Peter Peng: I love it
[1/18/23, 6:14:12 AM] Brian -IOM: Much better to devote time to how to make it more decentralised I think - rather than trying to resist it
[1/18/23, 6:14:32 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, I’ve been doing this for years
[1/18/23, 6:14:37 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes .. maybe. that's why i am here .. learning from you 🙏
[1/18/23, 6:14:51 AM] Peter Peng: Figuring out how humanity can scale with AI
[1/18/23, 6:15:14 AM] Peter Peng: I believe the answer is the blockchain as the DNA of AI
[1/18/23, 6:16:19 AM] Brian -IOM: I don't think AI marketplaces can work without crypto for one. Imagaine trying to rig something like that up to TradFi!
[1/18/23, 6:16:21 AM] Anita Lamprecht: is blockchain fast enough for AI?
[1/18/23, 6:16:47 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sorry for the question ... i am just a lawyer 😆
[1/18/23, 6:16:47 AM] Brian -IOM: Yes - esp compared to the alternative!
[1/18/23, 6:16:51 AM] Peter Peng: No but it can slow it down 🙂
[1/18/23, 6:17:19 AM] Anita Lamprecht: you mean humans ?😄
[1/18/23, 6:17:20 AM] Peter Peng: Governments should leverage blockchain to regulate it
[1/18/23, 6:18:25 AM] Peter Peng: We haven’t seen anything yet, ChatGPT is child’s play
[1/18/23, 6:18:26 AM] Brian -IOM: No cryptocurrencies as the foundation for an AI economy. The alternative being Visa, Mastercard and PayPal!
[1/18/23, 6:19:15 AM] Anita Lamprecht: copy
[1/18/23, 6:30:59 AM] Peter Peng: Exactly
[1/18/23, 1:42:16 PM] Peter Peng: Good news, I’ve finally got my own version of ChatGPT going using open source technology for GPTprotocol.com. Bad News is that it takes up A LOT of server power to run. 😅

We should expect to have holdings in LANUR.Swiss next week once we kick start the tokenization process 🤩

[1/18/23, 5:05:49 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like they pushed Elon Musk out though…
[1/18/23, 5:05:54 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure
[1/18/23, 5:06:06 PM] Garis Pang: Of course you are not. Appreciate your sharing. And does OpenAI start to break even or profitable yet?
[1/18/23, 5:06:40 PM] Peter Peng: No but they are coming out with a paid Pro version
[1/18/23, 5:07:37 PM] Peter Peng: The deal with Microsoft is that they get 75% profits until all $10b is paid back and then they own 45% of the company
[1/18/23, 5:07:45 PM] Garis Pang: ChatGTP making waves globally now, is OpenAI be shaken by it?
[1/18/23, 5:08:34 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGTP is owned by OpenAI
[1/18/23, 5:09:09 PM] Peter Peng: I’m making a Web3 version
[1/18/23, 5:09:35 PM] Garis Pang: Dall-E is another similar version by other competitor?
[1/18/23, 5:09:37 PM] Peter Peng: Because I’m a bit creeped out that one centralized entity owns it
[1/18/23, 5:10:01 PM] Peter Peng: Dall-E is owned by OpenAI
[1/18/23, 5:10:13 PM] Peter Peng: We all use similar technology

[1/18/23, 5:13:13 PM] Garis Pang: I will ask your AI to code scripts
[1/18/23, 5:13:26 PM] Peter Peng: It can
[1/18/23, 5:14:46 PM] Peter Peng: It’s pretrained on a dataset called “the Pile” which is 800GB of data
[1/18/23, 5:15:00 PM] Garis Pang: Not sure is there any limitation on particular programming languages in replying me based on my requests?
[1/18/23, 5:15:32 PM] Peter Peng: I need to test it out more but the intelligence is spot on with ChatGTP
[1/18/23, 5:16:02 PM] Peter Peng: I can also train it on custom datasets and make it smarter
[1/18/23, 5:16:03 PM] Garis Pang: Assuming that I want a C++ coding scripts in return, how? Can?
[1/18/23, 5:16:49 PM] Peter Peng: Right now my version is a bit slower than ChatGTP, I need more powerful GPU servers
[1/18/23, 5:16:59 PM] Peter Peng: Which are $$$
[1/18/23, 5:18:03 PM] Garis Pang: Any Free sources online?
[1/18/23, 5:18:18 PM] Peter Peng: Unfortunately not
[1/18/23, 5:18:36 PM] Peter Peng: I can find investors though
[1/18/23, 5:19:00 PM] Peter Peng: I prefer to create a foundation or DAO though
[1/18/23, 5:19:05 PM] Garis Pang: I think a lot of miners own the hardware of it, can contact them maybe?
[1/18/23, 5:19:17 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe
[1/18/23, 5:19:23 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t know any
[1/18/23, 5:19:59 PM] Peter Peng: So maybe give them tokens if they host for us
[1/18/23, 5:20:08 PM] Peter Peng: That would be cool
[1/18/23, 5:20:36 PM] Garis Pang: Tons of miners given up mining operations and the hardwares are redundant lying around.
[1/18/23, 5:21:59 PM] Peter Peng: I have a gaming PC I might be able to use

[1/18/23, 10:19:21 PM] Gary Teh: How can we get our hands on those? 

Was chatting with @12023686334 about the solar powered Bitcoin mining operation in the desert

We could reserved some of those machines to power the web3 AI that @14075792560 is right now training

[1/18/23, 10:32:09 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like the human design  system that @48606646246 recommended had been playing out naturally. In my case, the hermit profile. 

Haven’t really bothered to network during my time here. Somehow it the right people seem to get attracted into my gravitational field without any efforts on my part. 

Another house mate (who heads a family office branch) who heard the story of how I stumbled right into the desert nomadic tribe when I was just attempting to find a private spot in the desert for my year end retreat mentioned the right people will just naturally gravitate towards this energy frequency (whatever it is) which I have been emitting out into the ethers

[1/19/23, 3:22:25 AM] Peter Peng: Or several nuclear power plants
[1/19/23, 4:20:42 AM] Tres Garcia: Yeah. 1x trick pony that can mine a specific coin(s)… no AI here
[1/19/23, 4:21:39 AM] Tres Garcia: Challenge to @14075792560: figure out a way to solve AI problems using old ASIC miners
[1/19/23, 4:22:23 AM] Tres Garcia: Probably less expensive vs GPU on the equipment side. Will need that nuclear plant to break even on the energy cost!
[1/19/23, 4:22:30 AM] Tres Garcia: 🤣😂🤣
[1/19/23, 4:28:06 AM] Brian -IOM: 😂 the gauntlet has been thrown down! Seriously though, mining bitcoin will finance off-grid (decentralised) energy production. 😉

[1/21/23, 3:30:49 PM] Gary Teh: Some updates that might be of interest 

AID has been well received. We are right now helping work through a variant that would be suitable for implementation in the House of Balance. 

Solar powered Bitcoin mining has been really really well received. The CEO of EthicalFin seem really keen on participating. Getting a quotation for land price in Namibia from another contact. 

There might be potential for the same Namibian contact to become a partner to further extend EcoVerse21 into Namibia. Will also be having a follow up with the CEO of shareitt to explore partnering since they already have a very extensive network in Africa 

While listening in on various discussions, a variant of the cypher defense idea focused on Impact investing surfaced. We will be exploring how we could implement AID within this scope as part of our contribution. That variant will be implemented within the house of balance ecosystem since that ecosystem is squarely positioned within the social impact investing space.  

The city of Davos is looking to implement some AI based solutions. Their adjunct mayor has made an introduction to the relevant person in charge, having a follow up meeting to discuss how we can contribute next weekend. 

That is all for now 🙂🙏
[1/21/23, 3:36:27 PM] Peter Peng: Great update
[1/21/23, 3:39:12 PM] Gary Teh: ShareItt is already fully tokenized so we will end up having a bunch of their tokens in our vault if collaborations goes through

[1/21/23, 3:57:04 PM] Peter Peng: That’s the vibe I’m getting
[1/21/23, 3:57:55 PM] Peter Peng: China and Russia continues and will continue to be a non - threat to the changing world order
[1/21/23, 9:58:22 PM] Jonathan: Gary if you need more insight into land in Africa do contact me
[1/21/23, 10:01:01 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. Will reach out to schedule a chat beginning of Feb. travel and meeting schedule seems quite packed the rest of this month 🙂

[1/23/23, 4:14:42 AM] Gary Teh: Was thinking through the dataset we already have in our database, I believe the next time the Federal reserve reverses the direction of interest rates we should have enough quantitative data to get a sense of when reverse will be happening 

That should help inform capital deployment decisions. This is most especially once the solar powered Bitcoin mining operations gets up and running in the desert. 

I am thinking it will mainly be managing the portion that is kept in Bitcoin versus the portion kept on USDT.

[1/23/23, 9:32:55 AM] Brian -IOM: Does it work on WaPo and NYT?!
[1/23/23, 11:39:00 AM] Gary Teh: Who knows 🤷‍♂️

Will find out soon enough 

By the way the contact in Namibia is linking us directly to their government’s ministry 

I wonder if we should do the same with Kenya. Realized on the final day, one of our house mates works in the ministry for Kenya

[1/24/23, 2:39:03 AM] Gary Teh: Alitheum is looking to raise USD1 million to tackle the problem of fake news by implementing a technology solution

This is a use case that we have tackled through some technology implementation via Edgar.

When browsing through their team configuration it does not seem like they have a technology expert yet

Will be having a discussion with their team next week

What I am considering right now is “investing” our existing technology implementation into their company in exchange for a portion of shares that will be issued for their current USD1 million raise.

These shares will become part of our DAO’s holding

Will submit this for voting by our governors once I have finished discussions with their team.

If both sides are receptive, we will follow through with this line of execution 🙂🙏
[1/24/23, 2:42:43 AM] Gary Teh: Seems based on the current prevailing trend, moving forward our DAO will increasingly have holdings in projects that are aligned with our values

Valuation for our governance tokens will increasingly resemble the Singapore dollar. The value of that countries currency is basically backed by a collection of other currencies that it has trading ties to. 🤔
[1/24/23, 2:46:41 AM] Gary Teh: We will be having a physical meetup this coming Monday in zürich with @41791555798 @19514467219 @41765737357 and Gunter

topics we would like to cover during our session include:

1. How should on chain organization models that have gradual decentralization baked into their tokenomics be legally represented off chain

2. How do companies utilize tokenization to support circular economics. Gunther ⁩will also spend sometime to walk us through his project SPIN

[1/24/23, 2:06:57 PM] Gary Teh: Germany (NATO) just gave the go ahead for Poland (NATO) to donate their leopard tanks to Ukraine 

Meanwhile Chinese companies were identified to be supporting Russian war efforts

[1/25/23, 7:16:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: War in Syria took years…. Intentionally
[1/25/23, 7:16:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Step 1. Create a war

Step 2. Create a budget to fund war

Step 3. Assign budget to other country as aid and claim heroic status. 

Step 4. Pay ownself to manufacture equipment for war using that aid. So own war factories earn a full market priced revenue. 
 
Step 5. Send that equipment to other country and claim heroic status

Step 6. Record in books that other country owes you the full retail cost of those weapons in step 4.

Step 7. Get to build factories, take materials, free domination of land, or even future cash as repayment for weapons. 

Step 8. Report to government that instantly you flip investment 2x. Because 1 aid = money to self + money other owes you for equipment you made and “gave”. 

Step 9. Create another war again once this is over.
[1/25/23, 7:16:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s business
[1/25/23, 7:17:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Instant 2x returns.

[1/25/23, 7:18:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: U get to build military bases in japan. And japan jumps to your back and call whenever u need to threaten China
[1/25/23, 7:18:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: And every year japan sends huge amount of cash to usa as yearly tribute for being a good slave?
[1/25/23, 7:18:40 PM] Peter Peng: We’ll do the same with Russia
[1/25/23, 7:18:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: Where is this tribute? The 1.1Trillion of USA bonds

[1/25/23, 7:19:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: But over Ukraine
[1/25/23, 7:19:16 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa will own every Ukrainian ass
[1/25/23, 7:19:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: When it’s done
[1/25/23, 7:19:30 PM] Peter Peng: We will demilitarize them since they violated the rules of engagement regarding war
[1/25/23, 7:19:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Nah. Why do that. Keep them fighting. American war factories need to build weapons
[1/25/23, 7:19:55 PM] Peter Peng: We will demilitarize Russia
[1/25/23, 7:20:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: U can’t build bullets if u don’t have people to shoot them with
[1/25/23, 7:20:28 PM] Peter Peng: They aren’t using weapons responsibly
[1/25/23, 7:20:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: Drag the war out. As long as possible. Each usa tank is 10million revenue
[1/25/23, 7:21:10 PM] Peter Peng: Nah, just end it
[1/25/23, 7:21:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: Send 10. American factories get 100m of government funds.
[1/25/23, 7:21:22 PM] Peter Peng: Why waste time and resources
[1/25/23, 7:21:28 PM] Kelvin Chew: And usa gets an IOU from ukraine for another 100M
[1/25/23, 7:21:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Instant 2x

[1/25/23, 7:23:30 PM] Peter Peng: And power
[1/25/23, 7:23:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s what the Iraq war gives America. The prize is oil
[1/25/23, 7:23:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ukraine is metals
[1/25/23, 7:24:01 PM] Peter Peng: It’s about control
[1/25/23, 7:24:13 PM] Peter Peng: The most responsible controls
[1/25/23, 7:24:36 PM] Peter Peng: God decides who is the most powerful
[1/25/23, 7:25:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Yes that too. Now Ukraine has to give usa land to build bases and to put missiles

[1/25/23, 7:25:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Of course. Didn’t u read?
[1/25/23, 7:26:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Once this Ukraine conquest is done. The next war will come within 2 years
[1/25/23, 7:26:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just watch. It’s repeating for the last few decades
[1/25/23, 7:26:57 PM] Peter Peng: If Putin wasn’t abusing his power this would never happen
[1/25/23, 7:27:17 PM] Kelvin Chew: Putin was baited. Trapped
[1/25/23, 7:27:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: He fell for it.
[1/25/23, 7:27:43 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, one wrong move
[1/25/23, 7:28:03 PM] Peter Peng: Checkmate
[1/25/23, 7:28:26 PM] Peter Peng: We beat the Russians at their own game
[1/25/23, 7:28:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why do u think america had to withdraw troops in afghanistan so rapidly
[1/25/23, 7:28:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: They know they have bigger fish to fry
[1/25/23, 7:29:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: Afghanistan is not profitable anymore
[1/25/23, 7:29:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa always makes one war at a time
[1/25/23, 7:29:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s all carefully orchestrated
[1/25/23, 7:30:03 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t make war, we get involved in every war
[1/25/23, 7:30:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: U think the 20% defense budget pays itself?
[1/25/23, 7:30:51 PM] Peter Peng: We get paid to get involved
[1/25/23, 7:30:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: For a savvy smart business man like yourself. I am amaze u still don’t see it
[1/25/23, 7:32:00 PM] Peter Peng: We have a responsibility to the world to make sure everyone is protected by tyrants
[1/25/23, 7:32:37 PM] Peter Peng: We are like the protective big brother
[1/25/23, 7:33:19 PM] Peter Peng: The US are the biggest gangster
[1/25/23, 7:34:32 PM] Peter Peng: Russia and China are all talk
[1/25/23, 7:35:38 PM] Peter Peng: We will show them who god really is…

[1/25/23, 7:47:28 PM] Peter Peng: Under my regime, if Xi or Putin even blinks the wrong way, I’ll make very quick decision… just to send a message and exercise my power.
[1/25/23, 7:48:54 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t like to waste time.
[1/25/23, 8:11:10 PM] Peter Peng: Anyways! On a more positive note https://m.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/goldman-sachs-ranks-btc-above-gold-real-estate-and-22-other-assets-2987349?ampMode=1

[1/26/23, 5:26:05 AM] Gary Teh: @2348123243309 is helping setup an African based conference with AI focus. We are right now looking for more speakers on that subject 

I know that @16506464893 had done some work in that area as well in the healthcare industry in his previous startup

He might be good as a speaker 🙂🙏
[1/26/23, 7:43:12 AM] Peter Peng: Love your outfit
[1/26/23, 7:48:46 AM] Peter Peng: We don’t go an purposefully make war or want a war, which is why we would rather drop a bomb and end it… so you need to stop placing this false narrative that we (US) go around looking for a war.
[1/26/23, 7:50:43 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe it’s time to repeal the Geneva Convention to show Putin what we are talking about.
[1/26/23, 7:53:11 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe even throw one down on China for releasing Covid-19
[1/26/23, 7:53:56 AM] Peter Peng: If the East wants to play dirty
[1/26/23, 7:59:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: Curious though. Could u enlighten me why covid was found in the more remote states of usa before covid was found in wuhan China?
[1/26/23, 7:59:45 AM] Kelvin Chew: Cos I don’t really understand the chronology
[1/26/23, 8:00:54 AM] Peter Peng: China was mutating the virus in a lab
[1/26/23, 8:01:07 AM] Peter Peng: And released it
[1/26/23, 8:01:16 AM] Peter Peng: Purposely
[1/26/23, 8:02:00 AM] Peter Peng: It was thier attempt to take over the West
[1/26/23, 8:02:04 AM] Kelvin Chew: https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/01/940395651/coronavirus-was-in-u-s-weeks-earlier-than-previously-known-study-says
[1/26/23, 8:02:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s quite amazing China can hit all those states before the place they usually land in after flying into usa.
[1/26/23, 8:03:17 AM] Peter Peng: The Chinese government has state run media, of course they won’t admit to having it there first.
[1/26/23, 8:03:46 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the proper with an authoritarian government
[1/26/23, 8:03:54 AM] Kelvin Chew: And usa will readily admit to having the virus first that killed the world?
[1/26/23, 8:03:56 AM] Peter Peng: Problem
[1/26/23, 8:05:18 AM] Kelvin Chew: But then again 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/iraq-war-wmds-an-intelligence-failure-or-white-house-spin/
[1/26/23, 8:05:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: Western media is never controlled to say any lies
[1/26/23, 8:06:23 AM] Kelvin Chew: Usa clearly reported Iraq had WMDs right? So that must be the absolute truth
[1/26/23, 8:06:54 AM] Kelvin Chew: So u are right. China released covid to the world
[1/26/23, 8:06:59 AM] Kelvin Chew: Good job
[1/26/23, 8:07:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: Makes sense to kill themselves and shut down their entire economy for 2 years
[1/26/23, 8:07:26 AM] Peter Peng: They were trying to build them along with chemical and biological weapons. The chemical weapons ended up being used in Syria
[1/26/23, 8:08:55 AM] Peter Peng: They did, the Chinese government did
[1/26/23, 8:11:17 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yup. If the American media says so. Then it must be true
[1/26/23, 8:16:40 AM] Peter Peng: For the past 3 years there has been an agressive attempt for the East to take over the West. Since China’s Covid19 attempt failed, Putin has now tried… and is failing. Give up already.
[1/26/23, 8:18:02 AM] Kelvin Chew: Give up what? This war has nothing to do with me. Lol
[1/26/23, 8:18:19 AM] Peter Peng: The sun may rise in the East, but it sets in the West. “Lights out”
[1/26/23, 8:20:01 AM] Peter Peng: Stop trying to blame the US
[1/26/23, 8:21:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: Of course not. Who dares to blame US
[1/26/23, 8:21:56 AM] Kelvin Chew: Even when Nordstream got blown up. The world just shuts up
[1/26/23, 8:22:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s foolish to blame the usa at all
[1/26/23, 8:22:24 AM] Peter Peng: We are the peacekeeper, and we don’t do it by being pacifists like Ghandi… 😈 this is why the Pentagon is in the shape of a Pentagram
[1/26/23, 8:23:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: Thank you for keeping the world safe from Vietnam

[1/26/23, 8:25:41 AM] Peter Peng: You’re welcome
[1/26/23, 8:28:55 AM] Peter Peng: This is what the Chinese and communist did to my ancestors so I don’t feel bad at all

[1/26/23, 8:31:23 AM] Peter Peng: The west was on the verge of becoming like this if China and Russia are not stopped
[1/26/23, 8:34:23 AM] Kelvin Chew: U are Cambodian? Sorry for your loss
[1/26/23, 8:34:49 AM] Peter Peng: The false ideology they communism works is a utopian dream that could never work because humans are not born equal and have different levels of motivation. The system is actually extremely corrupt because the very small few at the top 🔝 control everything
[1/26/23, 8:35:02 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, my parents are refugees
[1/26/23, 8:35:55 AM] Peter Peng: We had to change our last name to Peng (a Chinese one) in order to come to America
[1/26/23, 8:36:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: I don’t disagree
[1/26/23, 8:36:08 AM] Kelvin Chew: Every system has a flaw
[1/26/23, 8:36:55 AM] Peter Peng: Capitalism isn’t perfect but it works the best so far
[1/26/23, 8:36:57 AM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe u should change it away though seeing u have a hatred for Chinese
[1/26/23, 8:37:51 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t hate them, but I don’t like that they threaten Western democracy
[1/26/23, 8:39:21 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why if it came down to it, we’d have to drop a bomb…
[1/26/23, 8:39:49 AM] Peter Peng: It would be a sad and tough decision to make.
[1/26/23, 8:40:31 AM] Peter Peng: We don’t go around looking for war, but rather want to protect people around the world.
[1/26/23, 8:40:40 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not about money.
[1/26/23, 8:42:24 AM] Peter Peng: It’s about freedom
[1/26/23, 8:43:19 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys. I’m following the East versus West conversation. Entertaining.
[1/26/23, 8:44:29 AM] Francois renet: Have you considered that it is not a continental conflict but rather that it comes from a bigger manipulation?
[1/26/23, 8:49:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: That what I have been saying all along
[1/26/23, 8:49:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s one giant manupilation
[1/26/23, 8:51:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: And just for anyone who has lost track. I am NOT from China at all.
‎[1/26/23, 8:59:19 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[1/26/23, 9:00:19 AM] Peter Peng: It’s fine, I have lots of Chinese friends
[1/26/23, 9:00:54 AM] Peter Peng: They hate their government too, same with my Russian friends
[1/26/23, 9:01:08 AM] Peter Peng: They want to be like America
[1/26/23, 9:04:23 AM] Peter Peng: My dream is that wars will be fought in the Metaverse and that political decisions will be decided on who has more “kills” inside of a game.
[1/26/23, 9:05:08 AM] Kelvin Chew: That I agree. Killing in the metaverse to replace physical wars is ideal
[1/26/23, 9:06:23 AM] Peter Peng: If we can use blockchain to make Metaverse land more valuable than land in the real world then it will incentivize nations to fight wars inside the metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:06:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: Each country should be given plots of land and weapons and troops according to their real world possessions. Develop a new war tech and build it. You gain a NFT or something to represent it in the metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:07:03 AM] Kelvin Chew: Then u fight. What u lose in that virtual place u lose in reality. Minus actual lives
[1/26/23, 9:07:21 AM] Francois renet: That is literally impossible I think. Land in the Metaverse is infinite. When it becomes to valuable and unattainable people will just create another Metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:07:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: So if u can’t hold land there. U can’t hold it in the real world
[1/26/23, 9:07:35 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe we can all get paid to play video games for a living… every kid’s dream
[1/26/23, 9:08:11 AM] Francois renet: People. Seriously. You’re just moving the problem from one space to another. The solution is changing the way we operate as humans.
[1/26/23, 9:08:31 AM] Francois renet: We have the knowledge. We have the tools. Let’s get it done
[1/26/23, 9:08:52 AM] Peter Peng: So we should just fight aliens then
[1/26/23, 9:09:01 AM] Peter Peng: Bring humans together
[1/26/23, 9:09:32 AM] Kelvin Chew: Aliens would avoid us. Who wants to be involved with a species so barbaric that kills each other for fun
[1/26/23, 9:09:56 AM] Francois renet: Here is my theory on that. Whenever I’ve managed very big teams I always had one awhile on the team. Everyone else was United around hating that one person!
[1/26/23, 9:10:27 AM] Francois renet: One asshole on the team. Frikkin autocorrect!
[1/26/23, 9:10:41 AM] Peter Peng: I think we should all ban together and hate Elon Muska
[1/26/23, 9:10:48 AM] Peter Peng: *Elon Musk
[1/26/23, 9:12:54 AM] Peter Peng: He’s been manipulating the world for way too long
[1/26/23, 9:14:02 AM] Francois renet: Agree 100000000%
[1/26/23, 9:15:14 AM] Peter Peng: Now that he’s losing influence I feel much more free
[1/26/23, 9:15:46 AM] Peter Peng: And I also feel like the world is getting back to normal
[1/26/23, 9:18:03 AM] Francois renet: Or is it the calm before the storm?
[1/26/23, 9:18:30 AM] Peter Peng: I think his time is up
[1/26/23, 9:19:40 AM] Peter Peng: He doesn’t understand politics
[1/26/23, 9:20:14 AM] Peter Peng: Global politics
[1/26/23, 9:27:02 AM] Francois renet: I was referring to the world in general. I think it all hinges on what will happen in Ukraine as far as NATO members position. Zelenskyy is definitely trying to light the fuse that will blow the conflict. We’d be better served going into Russia quietly and ridding the problem.
[1/26/23, 9:28:19 AM] Peter Peng: I think we need to do it from the inside out
[1/26/23, 9:32:11 AM] Peter Peng: I’m very well respected amongst the Russian mafia (I married one of their daughters)
[1/26/23, 9:33:39 AM] Francois renet: That’s a double edge sword @14075792560 ! Great when the going is good but yikes if you piss her off! 😂
[1/26/23, 9:34:45 AM] Peter Peng: We are getting divorced, they tried to kill me… but it didn’t work. Now I’m an even bigger boss 😎

[1/26/23, 2:05:16 PM] Peter Peng: ^ the fact that everyone was using Zoom after this gave the Chinese ability to spy on our business conversations.

It really helps to focus on the why!
[1/28/23, 2:14:13 AM] Youna Kim: Hey guys!
 you might be all in Austrian! I’m in Vienna at the moment. super!
[1/28/23, 10:16:38 PM] Gary Teh: Seems a lot of people are looking into mixing AI and Web3 right now thanks for the recent popularity of ChatGpt

I am aware that @14075792560 is also looking at creating one using the AI that he recently deployed on his local computer 🤩

This is the latest one introduced by @436608133615 that is already listed on the exchange 

https://singularitynet.io/

From my perspective the value of these use cases largely depends on the use case they are focused on tackling 

Worst deployments are those that are deployment hoping to find a relevant use case. Burning through cash while not knowing why they are burning through cash. From my experience studying AI startups in general most of these either end up becoming consulting companies or just die a natural death. 

@16506464893 previous startup in the healthcare vertical had a nice deployment since they were already positioned squarely along where the data pipeline is flowing and the use case naturally arose to them because of the nature of their market positioning
[1/28/23, 10:42:09 PM] Gary Teh: @447492703707 happy to find out more of the use case you are trying to tackle with BrightNFT 🙂🙏

Personal experience working on AI models. There is a lot of manual offline research before automation via AI

[1/29/23, 2:13:40 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of AI it might be interesting for both @14075792560 and @447492703707 to present your AI focused projects at the online conference that @2348123243309 is in the process of organizing 🙂🙏
[1/29/23, 2:14:29 AM] The Beer Hall: ‎You added Arie Ben David and Katherina 
[1/29/23, 2:14:47 AM] Brian -IOM: Would love to chat and thanks for the links. Singularity net is definitely a contender. Our base case hypothesis is that there will be such a thing as an AI economy within 5 years. And that it cannot run on TradFi rails. In other words, the convergence of AI and crypto is inevitable. We are tapping NFTs as the ownership layer for individuals to participate in the AI economy. Specifically dynamic NFTs that can represent evolving AI applications and models.
[1/29/23, 2:16:12 AM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me that there might be interesting synergy between the projects that @972556609556 @41762654166 @491736386942 @4915209984105 and @12063955455 are working on

Thematically they revolve around decentralized social mining 

If we could somehow combine our resources I believe the resultant social mining ecosystem will be phenomenal 🤩
[1/29/23, 2:18:53 AM] Brian -IOM: I have been wondering about a “Napster” for BTC mining for a while but I’ve no idea if SETI type distributed processing models will work for hash power
[1/29/23, 2:22:10 AM] Gary Teh: Mind sharing more on SETI? 🙂

[1/29/23, 2:25:44 AM] Brian -IOM: This but for Bitcoin? Don’t know if it will work because the sha256 side of things required the right kind of architecture
[1/29/23, 2:25:57 AM] Gary Teh: I just recalled @41799155602 is also doing social mining within the scope of his project too. This theme seem to be gaining momentum over the past few months 🤩
[1/29/23, 2:28:03 AM] Gary Teh: I believe if we could figure out a working prototype via the sun mint project (solar powered Bitcoin mining in the middle of nowhere/desert)  we could easily replicate and scale it 

Also during our discussions with @972556609556 and @41762654166 what might be really interesting is to implement biodynamic practices to restore the excess land and bring back nature 🤩

[1/29/23, 2:36:46 AM] Brian -IOM: Normally mining pools work the other way around - you purchase compute power on a centralised rig and are rewarded commensurately. The other way around, your free processing power would be accessed by the mining pool to run on your own machine(s). But the real question is if I have (for example) an M2 Mac Mini, how can its processing power be harnessed for mining BTC?
[1/29/23, 2:43:44 AM] Gary Teh: That would be something that @12063955455 could answer

Their distributed computing cloud they have setup is doing exactly that

I'll be glad to have you all to speak to Africans about your experience with AI in the conference 

We can't wait to have you guys 😊

[1/29/23, 2:53:44 AM] Gary Teh: Just added @41796560010 who is a recent contributor to our EcoVerse21 and SunMiny project as well 

She has a lot of connections in Namibia and has been helping us with sourcing for both land and produce from Namibia 

@2348123243309 perhaps the African focused online AI themed tech conference you are organizing might be interesting for her network there too 🙂🙏
[1/29/23, 3:10:17 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Amazing. Thanks, kindly 🙏🏼

But, that of NFTs. They're still coming up to that speed
[1/29/23, 9:02:11 AM] Brian -IOM: Thanks for the heads-up -- would be great to see African web3/NFT projects coming to the fore. 👊

And I finally got to meet @41791555798 in person

We discussed a bunch about tokenization within the Swiss legal environment as well as explored more deeply the project that @41791555798 is working on

I believe we will be hearing more from her about the project over the next few days 

Be popping by in zUg later to catch up with @19514467219 and @41764735824 🤩🙏

Was further thinking through the financing aspects of the solar powered Bitcoin mining project in the desert

Since we are procuring undeveloped land, we could Theoretically bump up its valuation after a slight amount of development and then secure loans using it as collateral. We will then utilize these loans to procure the equipment to do off grid Bitcoin mining 

Seems if structured properly we might not even need to inject our own fiat to finance this project instead of the current USD16K we need right now based on our estimates

In that regard the only thing we really need then is expertise and raw manpower. These we can easily support via our DAO

[2/2/23, 1:46:17 AM] Iwona Fluda: How about checking if there is a waste land to buy in Antarctica (here it will need to be checked). But! During summer in Antarctica between Oct and Feb, the sky is never dark. Around the summer solstice, the sun is visible 24 hours a day. 🙃
[2/2/23, 1:46:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: Put this sentence on Blockchain 🤩
[2/2/23, 1:55:07 AM] Gary Teh: Seems Antarctica is technically not ownablr by anybody since it is a continent that is dedicated for research purposes 

I wonder how to get this “experiment” of ours to qualify as research
[2/2/23, 1:55:31 AM] Iwona Fluda: Well, it looks like it's not possible because there is no official authority, which means it belongs to everyone
[2/2/23, 1:56:31 AM] Gary Teh: Maybe it would be good to establish a universal record of all human knowledge there

[2/2/23, 4:10:42 AM] Gary Teh: That is a very rich source of knowledge they have already gathered 

Let’s see what gets discovered during this upcoming trip 🤩
[2/2/23, 4:20:03 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. We have definitely experienced regime change from a market perspective 

It’s been fascinating to observe the various regime changes since 2020

2020 every time “coronavirus” mention spikes the market goes down 

2021 everytime “lockdown” mention spikes the market goes down

2022 everytime “inflation” mention spikes the market goes down

2023 everytime “inflation” mention spikes the market goes up  

Will probably make a note of these regime changes and the various correlations I was looking at so that it could be referenced easily in the future when similar patterns play out again in the future

https://trib.al/s8tfzgP?fbclid=IwAR0RhB3RpVotqOMmHleTejEoURi6J95G6FMPl8vyPB6Yd7NMImAI-TmChyY

From my perspective this skewered reporting on companies by the media is another manifestation of fake news that has potential to be very impactful 

All the negative publicity about their side experiment into metaverse which distracted investor attention away from the fact their three platform are still the only one that provides direct access to around 30% of the world’s population caused it to be mispriced quite a few months

Startups do a lot of side experiments all the time to test what works. Even our DAO have been conducting a whole bunch of these (discovering, testing and then killing or doubling down on value aligned projects)

Also the positive effects of laying employee in tech companies (in terms of communication overheads) have been very well documented in Reed Hastings book when 30% of employees were let go. Share price further tanked when this news was released two months ago

[2/2/23, 10:38:48 AM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 @972556609556 has utilized a very innovative approach which utilizes his art technique to build and uplift communities in Africa as well as schools in Isreal

[2/3/23, 12:32:44 AM] Gary Teh: Based on the inputs I have gathered from various DAO members, it seems it might make sense to have a once a month face time where interested members can attend if they are keen and available. 

The format I have in mind for these monthly online session is simple. 


1. - a quick walk through of how our governance works 
    - our rubric
    - our ledger 
    - how governance tokens are being awarded
    - how are members rotated to become governors
    - what are the existing functions/privileges are available for governors
    - what are the existing functions/privileges are available for token holders

2. - open format discussions where attendees can feel free to surface anything they feel other attendees of the session might find interesting to discuss about.

Part 1 - should be relatively short - around 10 minutes
Part 2 - might last up to 20 minutes or longer depending on how engaging the open format discussions feel for attendees of the session

[2/3/23, 8:12:02 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, one recurring pattern I am been noticing since during the pandemic until now is that while both mega and small cap companies share prices tend to buoy during times of positive macro news, small cap companies tend not to keep their gains when the sentiment reverses while the big cap companies keep on hanging to theirs. 

This resulted in the price of mega caps spiraling out of control into the stratosphere while the small caps generally trading sideways when the federal reserve switches into expansionary monetary policy 

See how this chart shows this trend perfectly over a 5 year horizon?

https://truesight.me/compare/DAL,META,NCLH,NFLX,NYMT,AAPL/2023-02-03/1800

This leads me to the two following hypothesis

1) maybe small caps are more suitable for very short term swing trading (a few days to a few weeks holding period) since their denominator doesn’t really change much

2) mega caps are more suitable for holding for prolonged periods of time (months to a year or two), basically for an entire duration of a central banks monetary policy regime

[2/3/23, 9:35:55 AM] Kelvin Chew: 📝 USA is afraid…. Of a balloon

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-spy-balloon-united-states-weather-3252711

Apparently the Chinese have never heard of google earth. Which can see more than one floating balloon. 

But it’s just an excuse to create justification and war sentiments for the upcoming war on China.

Which we are going to nuke them right Peter?
[2/3/23, 9:55:20 AM] Gary Teh: 2024? 🤔
[2/3/23, 9:57:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yup. For elections
[2/3/23, 9:57:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Rally the people against one common enemy
[2/3/23, 10:03:43 AM] Gary Teh: Which side do you think would do the rallying? The republicans or the democrats? 

From my perspective it’s enlightening to gain exposure to the prevalent narratives on various sides. It helps open up a full spectrum visibility to the pieces on the chessboard that are otherwise not considered if the lay of the land was just examined with just a restricted set of lens 

this recurring surfaced during conversation with a few folks while I was davos. 

It’s healthy to focus the attention to develop a positive mindset (the Yang) and it is insightful to study in the detail all the information that might be labeled as negative or come across as psychologically disturbing (the yin)
‎[2/3/23, 10:06:48 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/3/23, 10:13:18 AM] Kelvin Chew: Democrats I think
[2/3/23, 10:17:40 AM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense. Fromy perspective, the republicans have been tending towards the isolationist stance ever since the previous president’s term 

In fact that seems to be the prevailing attitude when I was doing the overland survey in the middle parts of the US.
[2/3/23, 1:13:52 PM] Brian -IOM: I would support this hypothesis based on what I have heard and understood. I think it’s almost tidal in nature, and you can use Totals 1,2 & 3 in charting to study it. But very basically lower-cap alts experience greater volatility and often in predictable cycles, following a bitcoin pump, as money diversifies out and increases its appetite for risk. So a perfect strategy would be to catch the waves in the ebb and flow, to advance and retreat. To be like water my friend. 😉
[2/3/23, 1:21:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway. It’s so easy to destroy the balloon. The government just watched it float in for weeks and did nothing then created this anti China story. It’s intentional. 

I mean they could have easily just sent Jerome Powell. If anyone can burst a bubble it’s him. Lol
[2/3/23, 1:35:09 PM] Brian -IOM: @14153000019 total 3 is market cap excluding BTC and ETH

[2/4/23, 3:57:14 AM] Gary Teh: Made some pretty interesting progress over the past few hours after chatting with @918017107841 when we unexpectedly chatted about EcoVerse21 after shifting our attention away from Cypher Defense (road blocked in that department at the moment still) 

Didn’t realize she is in fact a subject matter expert when it comes to international commodity trade 

Feels like we might have a bingo moment. Now that we have sources for coffee supplies thanks to @254729080961 and the list of potential purchasing agents thanks to @918017107841 we can now start experimenting on figuring out how to incentivize in a decentralized manner all the activities involved in moving coffee from point A to point B through tokenization of such actions in our rubric.

This network based infinitely inductive social experiment (game as @41791555798 and Geunther would like to call it) continues to surprise🤩

[2/4/23, 8:12:04 AM] Gary Teh: First hand information over coffee 🙂
[2/4/23, 8:28:50 AM] Gary Teh: I am actually starting to think this morning, as similar to all the prediction market activities and discussions shifting over to OffChain ecosystem that @14152032783 and @8618926086648 are nurturing, all the esoteric and spirituality related discussions might make more sense being shifted over to the house of balance ecosystem that @13104674556 Tiff and Hans Martin are nurturing 

Folks who are keen to dive deeper into esoteric and spirituality related discussions please to do let me know and I will direct as such 

Seems like the TrueSight DAO ecosystem is slowly gravitating back to its origins of surfacing impactful nascent trends and projects which are information arbitrage-like in nature as these other thematic discussions start flowing to vortex most suited for them. 🤔
[2/4/23, 8:30:50 AM] Jonathan: @14153000019 did you listen to this podcast? https://open.spotify.com/episode/3kuqnHcJpj0vNLTzHq7OWd?si=IwuxvSg3S4mBUSxxgLQong&utm_source=native-share-menu
[2/4/23, 8:31:33 AM] Jonathan: It talks for about a minute about the idea about validating people on twitter but it’s a long podcast and I can’t remember which part that was
[2/4/23, 8:32:17 AM] Jonathan: They mention stock forecasting and sports
[2/4/23, 8:33:26 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! He is the colleague of one of our board members in the previous company 

I remember one of my team mates left to join an early stage startup that he funded 

He is very very deep in the network effects/market place investing space
[2/4/23, 8:33:52 AM] Jonathan: It’s pretty good in general so may be worth a listen to the whole thing
[2/4/23, 8:35:02 AM] Jonathan: He also mentioned something similar to what we talked about in terms of matching people on LinkedIn
[2/4/23, 8:35:47 AM] Gary Teh: What about it? 🙂
[2/4/23, 8:37:17 AM] Jonathan: It was also a very short. I need to listen again but he seemed to be similar
[2/4/23, 8:39:35 AM] Gary Teh: Not surprised. A lot of the earlier stage investors that were sitting on Edmodo’s board were specialized in network effects and market place investing 

the chairman himself, who provided the seed funding, was the cofounder of LinkedIn.
[2/4/23, 8:40:02 AM] Jonathan: Nice
[2/4/23, 8:43:30 AM] Gary Teh: A few of the DAO members were early employees of LinkedIn and Google.

I guess network naturally taps on existing networks and grows of them. 

Putting aside the esoteric elements that were borrowed in the process of growing of this ecosystem, a lot of the principles were drawn from that network
[2/4/23, 8:46:10 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a lot of the really large tech startups in the Bay Area are really networks at their core 

Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter…

If you take into account the crowd sourced training data for Tesla’s self driving car even that company too

That seems to be what Bay Area is specialized in
[2/4/23, 9:17:17 AM] Gary Teh: Great catching up @14152032783 just made the introduction to the folks who are working on the collaborative pitching concept via LinkedIn messaging 🙂🙏

[2/5/23, 5:29:09 AM] Anita Lamprecht: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/philiprosedale_friends-i-am-looking-for-a-ceo-to-lead-activity-7027761702997811200-pEc9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios
[2/5/23, 5:35:49 AM] Anita Lamprecht: „The project/idea is a digital currency (not crypto, not blockchain) that allows communities to easily create and manage an alternative currency that can also be easily exchanged with other communities.  A big part of the idea is to reverse the wealth inequality that inevitably grows in any free-market exchange system“
[2/5/23, 5:36:18 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Sounds like an interesting project …
[2/5/23, 7:13:43 AM] Gary Teh: What synchronicity, was sharing this phenomena of remonetization with Johnny yesterday when we were discussing about the logistics of burying the containers in the desert. 

Actually briefly recalled surfacing the underlying issue (of prevalent mispricing) the other day on the chat too 

This two phenomenas of remonetization and social mining (that @972556609556 @41762654166 @4915209984105 and @491736386942 are working on) is Starting to remind me of the period in 2012 when there are suddenly massive numbers of new startups focusing on webscraping business models sprouting up because the viability of that technology frontier just open up. 🤔
[2/5/23, 7:19:47 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe it’s worth connecting with the inventor of second life 🤷🏼‍♀️..
[2/5/23, 7:20:00 AM] Gary Teh: Might make sense 🤩

[2/5/23, 7:15:53 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has kindly offered to help do up a landing page that introduces our DAO as well as the various we are supporting in our ecosystem

She needs help with someone who is good with drafting up content for the landing page she plans to create 

🙂🙏
[2/5/23, 7:17:10 PM] Gary Teh: Seems @19514467219 and @5511982667030 have both expressed the need for such a landing page too 🤔

I guess at some point maybe this landing page will manifest 🤣
[2/5/23, 9:53:10 PM] Anupa/diya: Stage 1: revamped with projects listed, purpose, intent, outcome onboarding steps and registration 
(Maybe the ability the switch between projects) and some other features 

Stage 2: customized member profiles with info and allocation and use of the tokens

[2/6/23, 3:40:37 AM] Gary Teh: One recurring pattern i am starting to notice within our DAO, the nomads and the house of balance is that a dungeons and dragons like “tavern” will tend to form after a while where folks just randomly pop in to chat about whatever. 

That is where they usually discover and find out about projects in the community that they might be keen to participate in or meet people whom they might find interesting to continue the conversations with somewhere else

In our case it’s this chatroom, in the case of the house of balance it’s their main community chatroom and in the case of the nomads is usually center camp ( or if they are planning to get high as well the dab squad camp) 

The projects within the communities takes place in a separate chatrooms that keen members would be able to easily get directions from.
[2/6/23, 4:45:18 AM] Gary Teh: Amazing to notice this insight only surfacing today on public media 

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-stocks-tesla-exact-sciences-cathie-wood-2023-2

It should have been apparent years ago. 

Access to proprietary dataset is what gives an AI model an edge over another which have exactly the same build. 

The other source of edge is the mental model of experts that were consulted to figure out the parameters when defining the model 🤔

@436608133615 just shared this. I first came across a variant of this prototype at the church of enlightenment here in slab city 

Will experiment with utilizing this in our Sun mint project 🤩
[2/6/23, 5:53:55 AM] Brian -IOM: These magnetic devices have been around for years and have allegedly been scaled - but they never seem to reach the market. 🧐
[2/6/23, 5:54:59 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : I hope this helps in any way, tesla experimented a lot with this stuff. He had more than 100+ patents on creating energy. Your idea is mindblowing, i wish you maximum success ⚡💡
[2/6/23, 5:55:04 AM] Gary Teh: Well they don’t need to. They only need to reach the off grid colonies that we are planning to create across the entire desert belt 🤩
[2/6/23, 5:56:05 AM] Brian -IOM: H2O can also be transformed into HHO
[2/6/23, 5:56:58 AM] Brian -IOM: That's the way to do it 🙌
[2/6/23, 5:57:15 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Do you have documents to share on that?
[2/6/23, 5:59:55 AM] Brian -IOM: Yes - give me 24hrs, I'm off to London this pm.
[2/6/23, 2:04:34 PM] Gary Teh: The battle of David versus Goliath begins

My sense tells me Google might end up winning out. Main reason is because they could give it away for free (subsidized via Ads revenue) whilst OpenAI needs to charge subscription
[2/6/23, 2:25:37 PM] Gary Teh: Now that funding has basically dried up traditional startup models that rely heavily on easy access to Fiat capital probably wouldn’t work as well 

https://trib.al/R4tFx7Z?fbclid=IwAR3vQ-4hjKYTgBdu1Qyr1jw8DEtAvoFM3irh4VrlsTVcak8h8qszTl9qtXo

My hunch tells me we should be expecting to see more and more of such decentralized funding models based on direct resource injection as opposed to indirect routes via fiat

[2/8/23, 3:50:16 PM] Peter Peng: Does anyone want to join the team at GPT Protocol? I’m putting together the website now to do our first token sale.
[2/8/23, 4:51:28 PM] Gary Teh: What are your project needs?
[2/8/23, 4:57:40 PM] Gary Teh: Do you also have more details like the deck listing the use cases you are going after, the tech stack you are looking at as well as the tokenomics you have in mind 

Chatting with Pascal who is leading the neutral AI initiative for the city of Davos this Friday 

Will help explore synergy between these two projects
[2/8/23, 4:57:42 PM] Peter Peng: Right now we need to collect wallet addresses that want to participate in our pre-sale
[2/8/23, 5:01:13 PM] Gary Teh: Which chain?
[2/8/23, 5:01:55 PM] Peter Peng: There will be 21 million “Genesis Tokens” at 0.00001 ETH ($0.017 ~ a penny) per token $GTP
[2/8/23, 5:02:08 PM] Peter Peng: This is for early insiders
[2/8/23, 5:02:28 PM] Peter Peng: Ethereum
[2/8/23, 5:02:57 PM] Gary Teh: Also do you have a roadmap?
[2/8/23, 5:03:37 PM] Peter Peng: After Phase 1 Genesis we will conduct a public sale 68 million tokens
[2/8/23, 5:03:56 PM] Peter Peng: Working on that now
[2/8/23, 5:04:38 PM] Peter Peng: It’s basically ChatGTP for Web3

[2/8/23, 5:12:27 PM] Gary Teh: Who else is in your team right now?
[2/8/23, 5:13:02 PM] Peter Peng: Im trying to figure out if I should bring it underneath JETSON X
[2/8/23, 5:13:23 PM] Peter Peng: But right now it’s just me
[2/8/23, 5:14:11 PM] Peter Peng: It doesn’t fit underneath JETSON X’s investment thesis so I might roll it out with a DAO
[2/8/23, 5:15:31 PM] Peter Peng: Or a few DAOs
[2/8/23, 5:23:23 PM] Gary Teh: Actually might make sense to fit it under JETSON X since that is basically AI focused anyways 🙂
[2/8/23, 5:23:52 PM] Peter Peng: Let’s see
[2/8/23, 5:24:16 PM] Peter Peng: I guess it still has real world utility
[2/8/23, 5:24:40 PM] Peter Peng: I just changed it to any wallet

[2/8/23, 10:48:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: Actually Gary.
[2/8/23, 10:48:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: I would say. Google’s upward momentum is declining rapidly and it is signalling a momentum trend change
[2/8/23, 10:49:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: However since it is still above the 0 line which I marked with the cyan arrow pointing to the dotted line. 

Is still a positive momentum.
[2/8/23, 10:51:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: The algo is predicting the momentum to reduce to below 0 or turn negative only by tonight
‎[2/8/23, 10:53:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: ‎image omitted
[2/8/23, 10:54:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: Looking at the weekly chart however. Google 10MA yellow line is projected to turn sharply up next week. And the confluence of MAs will present a strong support at $96.03 which is also the extreme for my calculated grid. 

Any price below 96.03 is a buy
[2/9/23, 4:17:10 AM] Gary Teh: I am wondering if some macro news is going to surface next and trigger the whole negative momentum in the market next
[2/9/23, 5:30:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: U mean positive.
[2/9/23, 5:34:43 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. I mean negative. Or has something negative already surfaced on your radar? The only ones that I am aware of that are of much impact are the interest rates and the US China tension

What I observe is the indicators signal a potential trends change first and then news happens before the trends really gain momentum and an overall trend reversion finally happens. 

It’s like the “insiders” place their positions first before news is being used to manipulate the masses for them to lock in their gains and then exit their positions fully

[2/9/23, 5:40:17 AM] Kelvin Chew: Based on TA and notwithstanding the upcoming CPI report

[2/9/23, 6:00:50 AM] Gary Teh: Been playing around with Microsoft’s ChatGpt implementation 

Doesn’t seem that very impressive. Its just another widget on their search results page 🤔

examining the full stack when it comes to both companies search business Microsoft and Google, here is what I am seeing

Both have large scale crawlers 
Both are reliant on Ad revenues
Both have enterprise suits 
Both have cloud service solutions 

For both companies to fully transition to AI conversation based chat for their search experience, they will end up cannibalizing their Ads business model. I doubt they would actually go about that. And I doubt publishers who have indexed their site against these search engines would welcome that. That would open a space for a new competitor to come in (duck duck go?) Publishers would end up indexing their sites against this new competitors if these two behemoths committed the mistake of moving away from the king of the hill positions they are currently occupying 

Plus it’s not really a great user experience. As a human I will still want to see the source and go down the rabbit hole myself. Rabbit holing is a very human behavior that will never go away. Having an AI chat bot to be the “be all end all” experience is basically a very faulty assumption of human behavior. It’s taking away the autonomy of human beings and humans will naturally revolt against that 

What might end up happening instead is their both companies start deploying these AI models to enhance the user experience across their entire product suit. However they have already been doing that for the longest time. So this is not new news 

When I dug even deeper into ChatGpt for deeper explorations of certain subjects I have challenges getting any deeper more insightful response than the usual superficial ones 

This might be a good question to pose to ChatGpt. How will Microsoft out compete google in the search business? 🤔
[2/9/23, 6:01:18 AM] Tres Garcia: I agree ☝️ “market go up 90%” of the time. I’m just greedy and want to make sure I preserve capital on the rapid falls down! 😂🤣😂

[2/9/23, 6:05:24 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. It’s all these micro level productivity hacks that then back into their existing products that will given them the edge

[2/9/23, 11:04:33 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking with the CEO of Alitheum today (whom was introduced during Davos)

Seems they have managed to figures out the initial marketing channel (via PR marketing) for their yet to be solution against fake news (which is exactly what Edgar is doing for us)

The goal of the session today is to figure out how we could invest Edgar into their project to form the center piece and for our DAO to own a piece of their company in the exchange

That way we could free up our resources to do something else while Edgar finally gets some much needed marketing power via this joint venture
[2/9/23, 11:05:13 AM] Gary Teh: Worse case scenario nothing comes out of this and we continue getting signals from Edgar on what to watch out for in the markets as fake news surface and distort market prices

Next steps in chronological order
- create a whatsapp chatroom I will be in it with them
- we share the link to our site truesight.me
- they share their product roadmap
- we identify the gaps between what is already there in Edgar and where they are planning to go with their roadmap
- we bring in the engineering leads
- we establish a valuation for Edgar and submit it. for voting amongst our governors
- we do an exchange
- The engineering lead gets selected to for follow on development to fill up the product gaps

Depending on how the talk goes as well as if there is a fit, let’s see if I could bring you in 

I have already sounded that project out to Vibhu. He mentioned he will take a look next week. He is right now partying in India 🤣
[2/9/23, 1:26:54 PM] Peter Peng: Sounds like fun, I want to go to GOA
[2/9/23, 1:29:46 PM] Peter Peng: Looking to bring on good advisors
[2/9/23, 2:08:05 PM] Gary Teh: Actually what would be really interesting would be to short Microsoft (if put calls are not already too expensive) at this point. 

The assumption underlying this is that the media hype will soon wear and the prices will once again revert back to mean when the crowd recover their senses 🤔

[2/9/23, 7:52:23 PM] Gary Teh: @14152032783 had a great chat with Tomas just now. Seems the same theme of social mining that we have been chatting between @972556609556 @41762654166 @491736386942 and @4915209984105 surfaced again 

I wonder if there might be synergy to be had 

There are a lot of web3 project leaders in the OffChain community 

A possible utility to test would be for these web3 project leaders to hire decentralized mechanical Turk to do QA testing for their  app. 

Untested smart contracts released into production environments is disasterous

The way to quickly test this utility is to surface and get a sense how many web3 project leaders in OffChain will be keen to pay fiat or their own tokens to access this service 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 7:55:47 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks Gary! Tell me more about the mechanical Turk concept. That’s interesting
[2/9/23, 7:57:54 PM] Gary Teh: Right now Qa engineers write script to test their app. Problem is it only captures a small subset of the bugs

The apps themselves still need manual testing 

The assumption is If product owners have a cheap way to get manual testing done, they would do so

Do follow up with Tomas to chat about it 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 7:59:25 PM] Peter Peng: I’m thinking my project will need help @14153000019
[2/9/23, 7:59:35 PM] Peter Peng: In all areas
[2/9/23, 8:02:29 PM] Gary Teh: You need to define the human resource slots. If not then at least the set of actions you need performed in your ecosystem 

@6594897484 made a really good movie recommendation which I finally got to watch on the plane the other day. Oceans 11

George colony and brad Pitt literally spent a few weeks defining the roles they need for their project and then went about recruiting those roles. 

Their team literally consisted 11 morels in that movie, hence it’s called Ocean’s 11. Danny Ocean’s (George Colony) crew of 11
[2/9/23, 8:04:07 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that Alessandro and me were chatting about using the decentralized model to crowd source data from startups to train an AI model that could be used to access social impact focused companies who want to raise funding

The real world needs and use case is clearly defined

You have defined a general technology direction you want to go with the AI platform. What is missing right now is the human need is not very clear
[2/9/23, 8:05:32 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks I need to pull together a leadership team
[2/9/23, 8:06:29 PM] Gary Teh: But first focus on discovering a real world need you want to fulfill with your AI stAck

Then figure who you need to pull into your leadership team 

The problem dictates the profiles and the profiles define the solution
‎[2/9/23, 8:07:58 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:08:10 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I think I’ll need a mix of people with AI experience and Web3 experience
‎[2/9/23, 8:25:24 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:29:34 PM] Gary Teh: Actually if you submitted it as a project in the governors channel for approval to include in our ecosystem I am sure governors will have it approved and we can then start figuring out which tokenizable actions we should within our DAO 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:30:45 PM] Peter Peng: Can we make governors as part of leadership team?
[2/9/23, 8:30:58 PM] Peter Peng: Well ones that want to participate
[2/9/23, 8:31:27 PM] Peter Peng: I would think that this project would be good for this DAO
[2/9/23, 8:32:34 PM] Gary Teh: Just propose this in the governors channel 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:33:36 PM] Gary Teh: That is aligned with one of our three core values 

Autonomy 

The rest being Integrity and diversity 

Exercise your own autonomy in this space

Always act with integrity 

Always respect diversity 

🙂🙏
‎[2/9/23, 8:34:38 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:35:53 PM] Gary Teh: You are own of the governors by the way, so surfacing projects to be voted for inclusion in our space is one of your privileges 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:38:17 PM] Peter Peng: Do you think the project should have its own DAO?
[2/9/23, 8:38:44 PM] Peter Peng: But also commingles with this DAO?
[2/9/23, 8:39:00 PM] Gary Teh: I would think of it more as an operations committee like how the other projects are structured
[2/9/23, 8:40:03 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha, but I can get real $ investments for this project
‎[2/9/23, 8:40:12 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:41:33 PM] Gary Teh: As with the way sun mint is potentially going to be structured different tier for folks who bring in Fiat 

In traditional terms a different class of shares
[2/9/23, 8:42:03 PM] Gary Teh: Just need to make sure the tiering is well balanced
[2/9/23, 8:42:35 PM] Peter Peng: Okay let me think on it
[2/9/23, 8:43:48 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure the folks who bring in fiat wants to have some form of accountability and maybe control over funds deployment 

Last thing they want is to be suckered into a pump and dump scheme

So having accountability in terms of funds deployment wi be key
[2/9/23, 8:44:23 PM] Peter Peng: I may just bring it under JetsonX if I build in plans to vertically integrate it into hospitality
[2/9/23, 8:44:47 PM] Gary Teh: Up to you. It’s your autonomy you are exercising 🙂👍
[2/9/23, 8:45:12 PM] Gary Teh: Let us know what you eventually decide
[2/9/23, 8:45:20 PM] Peter Peng: I can bring in big $ into the project this way
[2/9/23, 8:46:08 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, funding is of secondary importance 

The more important thing is the actual market adoption of what will get built
[2/9/23, 8:46:54 PM] Peter Peng: Well I need funding to pay for the servers and hire more engineers
[2/9/23, 8:47:00 PM] Peter Peng: I’m at that point
[2/9/23, 8:47:42 PM] Peter Peng: Pre-sale (Phase 1) will allow for this to happen
[2/9/23, 8:48:02 PM] Gary Teh: Premature scaling will probably kill the project really fast 🤔
[2/9/23, 8:48:40 PM] Gary Teh: Do spend time to figure the use case you are targeting
[2/9/23, 8:49:01 PM] Peter Peng: The pre-sale is capped at a certain amount of tokens
[2/9/23, 8:49:26 PM] Peter Peng: Then it moves into another phase
[2/9/23, 8:50:10 PM] Peter Peng: Kind of like different rounds (funds are allocated in different areas)
[2/9/23, 8:51:23 PM] Gary Teh: Do really spend time to figure out the primary use case and core utility is

I see so many web3 projects that raised funds and then immediately crash and burn because the projects leaders fail to consider this key aspects
[2/9/23, 8:51:47 PM] Peter Peng: I believe hospitality (restaurants, hotels, travel) is a good starting point
[2/9/23, 8:52:32 PM] Peter Peng: I’m already plugged into this industry
[2/9/23, 8:53:08 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Would be helpful if you can frame clearly an existing problem that AI could be used to solve
[2/9/23, 8:53:40 PM] Peter Peng: The corporations can buy these coins to train our system
[2/9/23, 8:53:54 PM] Gary Teh: Given your existing network, my sense is it shouldn’t be that hard to identify a good problem to solve
[2/9/23, 8:54:18 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to be able to ask it questions
[2/9/23, 8:54:55 PM] Gary Teh: Will need to identify a pain point these corporations want to solve 

Only then does it makes sense to consider tokenization
[2/9/23, 8:55:04 PM] Peter Peng: What steakhouse in NYC serves Opus One wine?
[2/9/23, 8:55:28 PM] Peter Peng: Today, ChapGPT not Google can get that granular
[2/9/23, 8:55:42 PM] Peter Peng: *ChatGPT not Google
[2/9/23, 8:56:08 PM] Peter Peng: Discoverability
[2/9/23, 8:56:46 PM] Peter Peng: They will buy $GPT to train their data into the system
[2/9/23, 8:57:40 PM] Peter Peng: And customers will have $GPT to make searches (micro transactions)
[2/9/23, 8:58:00 PM] Peter Peng: Instead of paying SaaS
[2/9/23, 8:59:51 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like these are two human behaviors statements you can quickly test amongst your network within the industry before even building out the system 🙂
[2/9/23, 9:00:33 PM] Gary Teh: Basically hypothesis that need to be true before you model can work
[2/9/23, 9:01:22 PM] Gary Teh: If you are able to validate these two behaviors to be true, I am sure fundraising will not even be an issue
[2/9/23, 9:02:00 PM] Peter Peng: Well they are looking to me to create the tech for the industry, I was unsure if I should bring this general purpose tech underneath the platform
[2/9/23, 9:03:15 PM] Gary Teh: Based on my experience People don’t like to think too much 

Just keep the experience dumb and stupid 🤣
[2/9/23, 9:03:29 PM] Peter Peng: But I think it’s a good starting point for commercialization
[2/9/23, 9:04:36 PM] Peter Peng: *I’ll have to release it with disclaimer
[2/9/23, 9:06:14 PM] Garis Pang: Once BTC be able to breached the 21349 Level, it will be a continuation of a major downward trend 📉
[2/9/23, 9:06:52 PM] Peter Peng: BTC is only going up
[2/9/23, 9:07:41 PM] Garis Pang: Ya after it finished off the major downward trend first 👎
[2/9/23, 9:11:38 PM] Gary Teh: By the way quick update on the EcoVerse21 project, now that the committee has horned in on coffee beans as the commodity we want to focus on, things are really gaining velocity 

@918017107841 is a real trooper leading the charge 🤩
[2/9/23, 9:14:38 PM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 I think I’ll create a GPT wallet that has our GPT protocol inside it
[2/9/23, 9:14:59 PM] Peter Peng: So people can use it inside the wallet
[2/9/23, 9:20:40 PM] Peter Peng: And then use the mobile wallet to also pay for things
[2/9/23, 9:26:18 PM] Peter Peng: Like “Google it” we can coin the phrase “ask GPT”
[2/9/23, 9:27:32 PM] Peter Peng: It will be Web3’s search 🔍

Those that have survived till now that are still doggedly working on web3 projects right now still are really the hardcore ones 

The folks who were just in the space because of the hype have all left by now

[2/11/23, 3:41:47 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 @5491125130580 is working on a game and is looking for utility 

Thought it might be useful to link up the both of you since you are operating a gaming launchpad
[2/11/23, 6:05:34 PM] Gary Teh: Had a wonderful coffee session with @5491125130580 just now where he suggested that we take a portion of the 5000USDT in our treasury and allow DAO members to control which publicly traded company stock symbols it gets deployed via a trading account through voting. 

The way it works is that members can surface stock tickers they find to be undervalued for a trade execution and other members in the community can either vote to execute on the proposed trade or skip it. 

A majority decision results in the capital in the trading account being fully deployed to that position via existing API integration that Edgar already has to Ameritrade or Coinbase. 

Edgar automatically exits the position once profit targets of 3 standard deviation is achieved

Since the current liquidation value (in traditional finance terms net book value per share) of our governance tokens are backed by the USDT balance we have in our treasury. 

This collective action will result in either the appreciation or depreciation of our governance tokens’ liquidation value

Seems like a great idea. Submitting it to the governors for voting. If it passes, makes sense to implement it when I get back from Antarctica later this month 🙂
[2/11/23, 6:06:50 PM] Peter Peng: Sounds like a great idea to build value
[2/11/23, 6:09:25 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it also makes a lot of sense since there are quite a few members in our community who have professional finance background
[2/11/23, 6:14:00 PM] Gary Teh: It might also start making sense for us to start listing the official liquidation value of our governance tokens on our landing page since we technically have access to the values programmatically be they 

1 - in our vault 
2 - in our trading account
3 - on the decentralized exchange (coming soon)

We will definitely need to get item 3 sorted out before Sun Mint comes online. That way members who wants to off ramp their governance tokens to help off set some in real life expenses can easily do so
[2/11/23, 6:16:15 PM] Gary Teh: As @5491125130580 rightfully suggested, Sun Mint will end up being the dynamo that powers all the other projects in our ecosystem that have some form of tokenomics associated with our governance tokens
[2/11/23, 6:35:25 PM] Gary Teh: Another highly impactful suggestion @5491125130580 made was to allow the entire community to control issuing governance tokens from our vault for airdrops in lieu of contributions made that are recorded on our ledger 

This helps us get around the current problem of rotating governors in and out of the vault management solutions we are currently examining 

If this rule comes to pass the role of governors would be reduced to

- editing rights to our rubric 
- editing rights to our ledger 
- rights to surface and vote on inclusion and exclusion of spaces/projects in our ecosystem

To keep things simple I am seeing each token holder to have voting right of 1 when it comes to governance token issues

Surfacing this for voting amongst the governors too

A member of our DaO is looking to reach them. Based on historical patterns. Seems receiving a surprised huge injection of funds might be in store for them 🤔
[2/12/23, 4:36:02 AM] Peter Peng: If you can use the profits to create a liquidity pool that would be even better
[2/12/23, 4:37:09 AM] Peter Peng: For Solana I believe you can you Serum for this but they are suggesting a minimum $10k
[2/12/23, 4:44:42 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. That is the plan 

To create a liquidity pool on Raydium which utilizes the serum protocol for our governance tokens liquidity pool

From what I observe now we are still USD5K short to create the liquidity pool
[2/12/23, 4:46:54 AM] Gary Teh: Assuming either sun mint or our collective open market trading activities go as planned (which things never really do given the chaotic environment) the profits will be utilized to create the liquidity pool. 

Future profits generated via the import/export transactions going through EcoVerse21 will also be used to populate our liquidity pool
[2/12/23, 4:48:20 AM] Gary Teh: If my hunch is right about the use case the Alessandro is mentioning about AI based pitch book model is true. 

The profits from those will also be utilized to populate out liquidity pool

Given the generally fixed and unchanging preferences of this demographic, It almost feels like this company is being kept alive by regular but indirect injection of government money. 

I doubt any of these folks would acquire a new hobby of skydiving anytime soon  

Oil price is definitely going to eat into their profit margin until the Russian embargo gets sorted out. Short to mid term headwinds 

Labor is mainly from Philippines (cheap labor)

Older folks don’t eat as much.

Last I overheard from a nomad who independently reviewed this company versus the other two larger competitors, it does not force passengers into any specific programs. The free and easy is the differentiation edge. 

Debt load versus its revenue is the concern. Likely not be an issue if the crowd really does rebound to pre-pandemic levels if it hadn’t already done so 🤔
[2/12/23, 8:37:21 AM] Gary Teh: Given a lot of baby boomers are hitting retirement age this decades I wonder how many percent of these new retirees will acquire this new hobby of cruises 

If it is significant then we should be expecting market size to generally increase (until they start dying off)

[2/13/23, 6:31:20 AM] Tres Garcia: Like…. since the 80s….
[2/13/23, 6:37:31 AM] Marvin: They didn’t put it as harshly, but they issued that statement around a month before the Ukraine war started

[2/13/23, 4:30:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: More warmongering. What rubbish that China is the one who is starting a Cold War when the Americans is the one that starts it. 

Who started throwing them with tariffs at them?

Who started to blockade semi conductor chips against them?

Who sent battleships halfway around the world to sail at the very doorsteps of their country? 

Who started the media smear  articles constantly over the years against them. 

Who declared a competition against them when China constantly asked for corporation. 

Who instigated riots in hongkong which is a China state. 

Who involved themselves in a “domestic” war between China and Taiwan which on one hand the world acknowledges the one China policy, but the next moment outright sends weapons to Taiwan who according to the one China policy they acknowledged is part of China itself. 

The hypocrisy is baffling. And they say that China is the one starting a cold war. 

Well. Media readers across the world are not stupid. At least not for people in Singapore (an allied American country. Not China)   

We know this is standard American suppression tactics.

[2/13/23, 5:00:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: If they created communism. And it works for their country. It’s their freedom isn’t it? So long as they don’t impose their communism against us. It’s the freedom of policy in their nation.
[2/13/23, 5:01:31 PM] Peter Peng: Right, but they kept trying to spread it
[2/13/23, 5:03:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: That I am against. But I just disagree with this communism thing. If a country has communism. Let the people deal with it. Or leave their own country. Another country shouldn’t involve themselves with another country’s culture and freedom and traditions. 

Otherwise they are just a busybody.
[2/13/23, 5:04:13 PM] Peter Peng: I agree, unless their is oppressive and there is enough data to suggest that intervention is needed
[2/13/23, 5:04:33 PM] Peter Peng: *their government
[2/13/23, 5:05:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Who gave the right for another country to intervene? Who made another country ruler of this world to decide who needs intervention.

[2/13/23, 5:10:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then u are part of the theology that God is not all good nor all evil. God is God and is neutral. 

I don’t really agree with that. But I have heard of that debate.
[2/13/23, 5:13:43 PM] Peter Peng: Good and evil is based on perspective
[2/13/23, 5:14:09 PM] Peter Peng: God is just the highest power
[2/13/23, 5:15:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: I can’t debate against that. Your statement is not untrue
[2/13/23, 5:19:13 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just making an observation based on my own personal experience, but that could be different for others.. but I’m glad that you can relate to it even though we have different viewpoints politically
[2/13/23, 5:29:14 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe as humanity right now is setting up the bases for the laws of AI, that can help us to create better laws for us, for some elemental and basic interactions and behaviors, where we can at least grow from there, even maybe unite... pretty optimistic, sorry. Even smart contracts are creating a different mindset to achieve that.
[2/13/23, 5:30:09 PM] Peter Peng: I agree 100%
[2/13/23, 6:15:08 PM] Marvin: China has been an awful partner, they banned a number of foreign imports, American social networks, stole an enormous amount of western technology forcing western companies into joint venture for market access. Most people in Hong Kong and Taiwan want to keep their independence, a fact that China likes to ignore. What smear campaigns? You mean news reports in all countries where journalists don’t get arrested when they write articles?
[2/13/23, 6:15:53 PM] Marvin: China has not been a reliable partner, I hope Europe and the US shift their focus towards India and other more democratic nations as partners

The Actor had signed tons of debts deal created by the US’s Military Complex, which can’t be repaid in due time. Big stakes are in for possible repossession of lands in return to repay the debts incurred by Ukraine for the Jews to move in even if the lands are still there for them. Purely my own assumption.

This is great. 
Love the lack of LT strategic vision. Spot on…. But “Why?”

Why does the US Military lack a significant Long term strategic vision: 

1. Nothing to do with Israel’s secret cabal
2. Everything to with US election cycles (4years) and
3. Annual military/ US budget spending. 
4. Congress & The Sed def are always trying to predict the next war and not how to fight the last war. (See Iraq 2003-Present) they were geared for Iraq 1994, but got an insurgency. 
5. Now back to the table to ask for more money, and stay in office. 

Vs China with a 50 year plan held by the people in power that will stay in power until the day they die. No need to change strategies mid term.

It might start making sense to track the headlines published on the landing pages of these domains and then award members governance tokens for discovering these new sources. This is because more of these sources will help Edgar become even more calibrated when discovering and surfacing new impactful trends for portfolio management purposes 

Surfacing this for voting amongst the governors 🙂👍

[2/15/23, 7:52:50 AM] Kelvin Chew: I recently had the opportunity to learn from a school that uses i-ching/5elements/numerology and fengshui combined and use it to calculate moments of higher energy states (or luck) do execute more risky trades. Lol

[2/15/23, 7:53:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just thought u might find it interesting since I know u are into this form of traditional culture
[2/15/23, 7:56:51 AM] Kelvin Chew: I basically am starting to have too many people to handle in my chat group. So I split my people up into sub groups and I allocate “leaders” for each group. And even used numerology to split the groups. So that every team’s luck is synergised and compatible. LOL
[2/15/23, 8:13:31 AM] Gary Teh: Peter Gwee (Fengshui master) who was trying to get my help to rewrite his Fengshui software proposed the same

[2/15/23, 9:04:13 PM] Jonathan: is there any service out there that allows you to take a photo and stamps the time and date on the blockchain immediately - so minting an NFT but not needing a wallet? pay with credit card.. a very small fee... for instance a picture at a board meeting to prove everyone was there.. ideally having some AI algorithm also investigate if the photo has been doctored. Just had a board meeting and I thought this would be an extra plus.
[2/15/23, 9:04:20 PM] Jonathan: might be demand for that.
[2/15/23, 9:06:35 PM] Jonathan: is there a way for a software to be sure that a photo was taken live? Maybe this service is out there. Just when you are thinking of listing your company later, it might be nice to show that the board meetings before really took place if it the cost is negligible.
[2/15/23, 9:07:15 PM] Jonathan: or at least very reasonable.
[2/15/23, 9:08:06 PM] Peter Peng: You would think, as I was writing my AI whitepaper today I’m starting to realize just how early we all are with Web3. It just seems like forever because I’ve been investing in crypto since 2017z
[2/15/23, 9:08:24 PM] Peter Peng: Everyone is building now
[2/15/23, 9:09:46 PM] Peter Peng: My instinct is that AI will save Crypto / blockchain / web3 because verification of data and digital trust will be a huge issue
[2/15/23, 9:16:54 PM] Jonathan: Might not be so hard to market this service if you go to the VCs and offer it with some other services to verify what the portfolio companies are doing.
[2/15/23, 9:18:07 PM] Peter Peng: Blockchain actually let’s the VC do a better job of keeping track of their portfolio companies
[2/15/23, 9:19:30 PM] Peter Peng: My thinking is that they could use a ChatGPT like system to get automated updates and reports

[2/16/23, 9:11:54 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGPT helped me write my whitepaper. Instead of banning it, schools should teach people how to utilize it. It’s not as easy as people make it out to be because you have to make it learn what you want.
[2/16/23, 9:13:05 PM] Peter Peng: For example, schools didn’t ban calculators… they invented Calculus.
[2/16/23, 9:14:07 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGPT is almost like an advanced literary calculator …

[2/16/23, 9:32:13 PM] Anupa/diya: I think it a great research tool in academia. I think schools just have to find the right use for the student and the school so the originality is maintained.

If the searches are all automated, I hope the answers don't turn into being generic. 

As a user, I would like to see how many people have used the same prompt to get the same answer or even maybe see the edited versions to the text.
[2/16/23, 9:33:27 PM] Peter Peng: Agree, or maybe generate responses trained on your personal writing style
[2/16/23, 9:33:45 PM] Peter Peng: Hyperpersonalized AI
[2/16/23, 9:35:29 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like for my whitepaper, the answers are original because I asked it very specific questions tailored to this topic
[2/16/23, 9:35:43 PM] Anupa/diya: I am wouldn't want to publish something which 50 other people have already used. Maybe it can be a paid version where the ai can be more bespoke. Like what grammarly does.
[2/16/23, 9:37:14 PM] Anupa/diya: If you could see if it has been published or used. Then it would add more value.
[2/16/23, 9:38:15 PM] Anupa/diya: This gives rise to the ai prompt writing community who can customize and even sell their work. Who knows.
[2/16/23, 9:38:16 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I guess. It’s like someone taking Bitcoin’s whitepaper and reusing it lol

[2/17/23, 5:24:59 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of execution, you might want to remove the section on storing personal (training) data on the blockchain 

Been toying it around in my head for the past few months, that technical approach doesn’t scale very well.

You are forcing every single miner to keep petabytes of data in every instance 

From my perspective the more appropriate one would be something more similar to the bit torrent protocol where your data is stored on your local and is made available to AI trainers once the trainer agrees to a smart contract to exchange certain amount of governance tokens for the training data that is sitting on your local 

There are a few folks I was hoping to invite into the AI chatroom had the gating/quality assurance been better managed to discuss about this as well as some other issues I had in mind when implementing the decentralized AI now that I have had a better sensed attempting to decentralized the ownership and management of Edgar.

Namely:
——
The director leading the AI initiative 

Vibhu my former boss (who used to head RnD in Google) who is also starting to think along this direction 

The CIO of one of the London based in investment funds whom we discussed this topic very deeply while we were in davos
[2/17/23, 5:39:24 AM] Peter Peng: The data would be anonymized
[2/17/23, 5:40:15 AM] Peter Peng: I believe there would need to be a hybrid approach
[2/17/23, 5:43:59 AM] Peter Peng: I was discussing this with a blockchain group based out of Sweden yesterday
[2/17/23, 5:45:43 AM] Peter Peng: Either way this should all come at subsequent phases

[2/17/23, 6:42:45 AM] Gary Teh: Seems TrueSight.me is going to be down for a few days. 

My Credit card got hacked four months ago. Didn't receive any complain letters from Amazon about the payment not going through. I was assuming their service was really smart to auto resolve to the new credit card issued by my bank. Guess not. 

They suspended the AWS account used to run the data gathering services as well as the DNS services. 

Just updated the credit card associated with that AWS account. Their services should take a few days to restore. And then I will need to head in and restore the servers that were running in that account. 

We should expect a few days of missing data in our data set as we slowly get everything restored.

Meanwhile let's just all twiddle our thumb and do nothing! 🤣
[2/17/23, 6:46:25 AM] Gary Teh: Worse case scenario, I can start focusing on restoring servers on the 26th when I get back to Buenos Aires.
[2/17/23, 6:46:57 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.

[2/17/23, 7:54:40 AM] Gary Teh: It does make a lot of sense to decentralized the underlying infrastructure otherwise despite all web3 claims of decentralization, all the underlying infrastructure is still held captive by AWS, google and Azure. 

This does make the whole decentralization argument of the web3 trend sound stupid

And AI (definitely the training portion and maybe the neural network portion ) being a very infrastructure heavy behemoth will really need to confront this infrastructure centralization issue head on.
[2/17/23, 8:07:04 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, but first Web3 needs to take marketshare from the big guys in the space. Then let’s other protocols emerge from it. Basically what Ethereum did to Bitcoin and others.
[2/17/23, 8:07:50 AM] Peter Peng: The other protocols can solve the solution off of the core tech
[2/17/23, 8:08:23 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the true nature of decentralization
[2/17/23, 8:08:30 AM] Gary Teh: Happy to have web3 take Edgar’s portion of market share away from big guys 

Tired of paying UsD 1000 plus per month to Jeff Bezos 🤣
[2/17/23, 8:09:26 AM] Peter Peng: Do you really need Edgar?
[2/17/23, 8:09:38 AM] Gary Teh: Yup.
[2/17/23, 8:09:46 AM] Peter Peng: Then maybe it’s worth it
[2/17/23, 8:10:07 AM] Gary Teh: Especially when it help us make so much money from the macro trades
[2/17/23, 8:10:28 AM] Peter Peng: If it makes you money then keep it
[2/17/23, 8:10:47 AM] Gary Teh: Happy if someone can come up with an infrastructure that we can pay them the USd1000 per month instead of Amazon
[2/17/23, 8:11:13 AM] Peter Peng: You should build it
[2/17/23, 8:11:23 AM] Peter Peng: Who built Edgar?
[2/17/23, 8:11:27 AM] Gary Teh: Too large an infrastructure
[2/17/23, 8:11:46 AM] Gary Teh: That would be me
[2/17/23, 8:12:24 AM] Peter Peng: If it pays for itself maybe keep it like that?
[2/17/23, 8:12:50 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/17/23, 8:13:07 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. That would be centralization once again
[2/17/23, 8:13:45 AM] Peter Peng: Does Edgar trade crypto?
[2/17/23, 8:14:08 AM] Gary Teh: I had engineering background in helping scale the platform of Edmodo from 10 million registered users to 100 million registered and then also on the growth hacking side which involved a lot of human psychology
[2/17/23, 8:14:13 AM] Gary Teh: Yes it does

[2/17/23, 8:17:03 AM] Peter Peng: To see if people get on board
[2/17/23, 8:17:41 AM] Gary Teh: A lot of the trading thesis for these two asset classes were collaborative discovered by TrueSight DAo members 

Lot of these members either have background in technical analysis, fundamental analysis, quantitative trading, psychology or engineering
[2/17/23, 8:18:32 AM] Peter Peng: Then it should be easy
‎[2/17/23, 8:19:00 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/17/23, 8:19:47 AM] Gary Teh: Best to just decentralized the infrastructure and for folks who have use of it to contribute resources to run portions of it
[2/17/23, 8:20:37 AM] Peter Peng: Or find investors
[2/17/23, 8:21:32 AM] Peter Peng: If it’s a good idea someone will invest in it, just takes a lot of work. They also need to be a right fit.
[2/17/23, 8:23:05 AM] Peter Peng: Selling some sort of digital asset to fund it makes sense if you are a DAO
[2/17/23, 8:23:34 AM] Gary Teh: That introduces centralization

Just look at Wikipedia. That is a truly decentralized model. They just sustain their servers through donations
[2/17/23, 8:24:16 AM] Gary Teh: Happy to hear your proposal in that regard. I am sure the good ones will gain you more governance tokens in the DAO
[2/17/23, 8:25:08 AM] Peter Peng: I think you need a liquidity pool for the tokens
[2/17/23, 8:25:24 AM] Peter Peng: Or some larger plan
[2/17/23, 8:25:43 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t know
[2/17/23, 8:26:19 AM] Gary Teh: Liquidity pool makes a lot of sense. Still waiting for the governors to decide on the governance tokens vault management solution 

Voting on which liquidity pool pair to setup is the next item on the agenda
[2/17/23, 8:26:36 AM] Peter Peng: It makes it more real
[2/17/23, 8:27:00 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/17/23, 8:27:03 AM] Peter Peng: Like I want to be able to cash out my tokens
[2/17/23, 8:27:24 AM] Gary Teh: I am sure everyone feels the same 🤣
[2/17/23, 8:27:52 AM] Peter Peng: Haha yeah, no one is going to continue contributing if there is no real incentive
[2/17/23, 8:27:57 AM] Gary Teh: Right now the governance tokens are still sitting in the wallet controlled by me

That from a decentralization perspective is highly undesirable
[2/17/23, 8:28:19 AM] Peter Peng: Think about it
[2/17/23, 8:28:26 AM] Gary Teh: True. We are still short of USd5000 to setup liquidity pool based on radium though
[2/17/23, 8:28:50 AM] Gary Teh: That is correct 

Been on the back of my mind
[2/17/23, 8:28:52 AM] Peter Peng: You can do it for less
[2/17/23, 8:29:05 AM] Peter Peng: 10k is just recommended

The interesting thing would be to observe what actually happens after that 

Two possibilities I could think of 

1) everyone cashes out and project dies 🤣

2) the project actually starts growing 🤔

Thankfully since data aggregation for market pricing data was done in another DAO member's AWS account, the only thing that was really disrupted was the News sentiment analysis portion of Edgar. Only around 24 hours worth of data was affected. 

Edger is back to normal

I am going out of Web3 more but still happy to connect people :)

Have a lovely weekend!

[2/18/23, 11:01:13 AM] Brian -IOM: Bit boy crypto believes this SEC pincer movement is about getting rid of BUSD (and perhaps even Tether), as well as to dissuade other players from bringing their stable coins. So in other words Circle has already been chosen.
[2/18/23, 11:02:00 AM] Brian -IOM: USDC
[2/18/23, 11:03:08 AM] Gary Teh: @447492703707 are you voting for USDC??
‎[2/18/23, 11:05:10 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/18/23, 11:05:16 AM] Brian -IOM: I’m not voting for anything - I’m simply implying it may be a foregone conclusion! Check the diagram - this is the system they are adopting. Cardano is ISO compliant incidentally. And Cypherium, which is partnered with Fed Now
[2/18/23, 11:05:56 AM] Brian -IOM: Nice one! 👏

[2/18/23, 12:01:45 PM] Gary Teh: One key thing that keeps coming back to mind as I think about decentralized data piping to train decentralized AI is the need for a decentralized queueing system that functions very similar to either Redis or RabbitMQ
[2/18/23, 12:01:57 PM] Gary Teh: Right now there is not such system available
[2/18/23, 1:49:32 PM] Tres Garcia: I think tether has done enough self harm to lose market share on its own. Will take time to build it back. 

SEC can’t really dictate what happens with Teather or stable coin because it’s not a security/ can’t pass the howie test & not US based. 

The OCC can go after Teather requiring a banking license or money transfer license
[2/18/23, 1:50:53 PM] Tres Garcia: So SEC makes noise to see if USDT de pegs…. If yes. They win… if not then OCC will have to take lead. 

Since it didn’t depeg after Luna, I think USDT will live on
[2/18/23, 2:04:47 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not worried about any government age I
[2/18/23, 2:04:53 PM] Peter Peng: *agency
[2/18/23, 2:13:05 PM] Brian -IOM: The hypothesis I heard was that the SEC is going after crypto banks like Silvergate and there is one such bank that has ties to Tether that could act as an attack surface. It’s not my area of expertise - but the coordinated approach to the crackdown isn’t a coincidence, they’re clearing a path for a digital dollar.

[2/18/23, 2:24:11 PM] Brian -IOM: New payments messaging standard - ISO20022
[2/18/23, 2:26:09 PM] Brian -IOM: ALGO, XRP, XDC, XLM, CPH, ADA +++
[2/18/23, 4:02:38 PM] Tres Garcia: Cool idea. But I guarantee there is no secret cabal putting that into play. (No resources and No need)

The minute a digital dollar comes online it will be the global standard backed by the US Fed Govt. No need to compete with USDC / USDT or other inferior competitors.
[2/18/23, 4:04:08 PM] Tres Garcia: If everyone else is playing with / on ISO20022 standards, the digital dollar gate keepers will be commodities and rent seeking.
[2/18/23, 4:42:04 PM] Peter Peng: If people found out the US government created Bitcoin it would go to zero.
[2/18/23, 4:42:23 PM] Peter Peng: So they will deny any involvement
[2/18/23, 4:43:18 PM] Peter Peng: There is no need for a digital dollar, but they will fund certain coins
[2/18/23, 4:53:13 PM] Brian -IOM: Maybe that’s what that salty old business tycoon who says “if you ever found out who invented Bitcoin, it would go to zero” meant! 😂

What a lousy journalist. This is very inaccurate and bad reporting. 

The correct way to write it is 

“Al-Omar oil field is the largest Syrian oil field. The US is currently LIBERATING the oil field from COMMUNIST/TERRORIST forces, and has  repeatedly RECOVERED Syrian oil to the tune of billions of dollars for some ESG Purposes or to Reduce European oil shortages from Russian Oppression.”

[2/23/23, 12:52:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: 🚨 China directly confronts USA

📝 an open letter on the China ministry’s website for the world to see

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2023-02-21/china-calls-usa-out-publicly
[2/23/23, 12:52:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: And it’s evidence based contents are undeniable
[2/23/23, 12:53:02 PM] Peter Peng: Oh a letter, so scary 😂
[2/23/23, 12:53:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: The pen. Is mightier than the sword.
[2/23/23, 12:53:51 PM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂 something China would say…
[2/23/23, 12:54:16 PM] Peter Peng: When was the last time they’ve been to war? Ming Dynasty 😂
[2/23/23, 12:54:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: The English words "The pen is mightier than the sword" were first written by novelist and playwright Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1839, in his historical play Cardinal Richelieu.
[2/23/23, 12:54:42 PM] Peter Peng: They have no idea 🤷‍♂️
[2/23/23, 12:55:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Which is good actually. Peace loving people they are
[2/23/23, 12:56:03 PM] Peter Peng: Good, they should keep it that way
[2/23/23, 12:56:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: Shows your obvious bias ness if a well known English idiom can be attributed to China. Lol
[2/23/23, 12:56:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Everything is china’s fault to u.
[2/23/23, 12:57:04 PM] Peter Peng: No, mainly blame Russia
[2/23/23, 12:57:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: Next u will be blaming a tropical storm or an act of god by the Chinese gods
[2/23/23, 12:57:43 PM] Peter Peng: No, it’s weather modification done by the US government
[2/23/23, 12:58:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: True. Us thinks they are gods anyway

[2/23/23, 1:12:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: Exactly what the letter says as well.
[2/23/23, 1:12:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: My gosh Peter. Did u just agree with China?!
[2/23/23, 1:12:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Have they infiltrated u?
[2/23/23, 1:12:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Are u a spy from China?
[2/23/23, 1:12:49 PM] Peter Peng: It says that in the paper?
[2/23/23, 1:13:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: U obviously did not read

[2/23/23, 1:13:05 PM] Peter Peng: Lol

[2/23/23, 1:13:40 PM] Peter Peng: I have my sources
[2/23/23, 1:13:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: China obviously. Since u just agreed
[2/23/23, 1:14:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tsk tsk tsk
[2/23/23, 1:14:21 PM] Peter Peng: Where in the paper does it say that?
[2/23/23, 1:14:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: Read it. Instead of a keyword search
[2/23/23, 1:14:50 PM] Peter Peng: I honestly don’t care enough to read it
[2/23/23, 1:15:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then have ur sources in China explain it to u
[2/23/23, 1:15:54 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe
[2/23/23, 1:16:46 PM] Peter Peng: But no one cares lol 😂
[2/23/23, 1:18:51 PM] Peter Peng: The world doesn’t want to be governed by China or Russia which is why they’ll always lose to the West.

[2/25/23, 1:55:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: “Far from severing trade relations between the BRICS nations, US and NATO efforts to wage economic warfare over the Ukraine conflict have instead brought the countries closer together.  The BRICS are now engaged in bilateral trade which cuts out the US dollar as the world reserve currency and China is pursuing stronger military ties to Russia on top of its increased purchases of Russian commodities.

Given the rising potential for future hostilities between the US and China, their closer associations with Russia could impede the defense of Taiwan or other allies in the Pacific.  In other words, the US government has potentially sabotaged its own interests. “

[2/26/23, 3:06:31 AM] Kelvin Chew: Does ur history go beyond the movie?
[2/26/23, 3:06:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: “The Helots, whose name means “captives,” were fellow Greeks, originally from Laconia and Messenia, who had been conquered by the Spartans and turned into slaves. The Spartans’ way of life would not have been possible without the Helots, who handled all the day-to-day tasks and unskilled labor required to keep society functioning: They were farmers, domestic servants, nurses and military attendants.
Spartans, who were outnumbered by the Helots, often treated them brutally and oppressively in an effort to prevent uprisings. Spartans would humiliate the Helots by doing such things as forcing them to get debilitatingly drunk on wine and then make fools of themselves in public. (This practice was also intended to demonstrate to young people how an adult Spartan should never act, as self-control was a prized trait.) Methods of mistreatment could be far more extreme: Spartans were allowed to kill Helots for being too smart or too fit, among other reasons.”

[2/26/23, 7:47:30 AM] Tres Garcia: Yes. Thank you! ☝️This is my point on not historically accurate. 

The Spartins (Greeks as a whole promoted Democracy, but also used slave labor to do so)

So to say they were fighting for freedom…. Eeeehhhh…. The freedom to choose the right to vote vs a dictator from a land far away…. More accurate
[2/26/23, 7:48:35 AM] Tres Garcia: Either way, it’s jerks fighting bigger jerks
[2/26/23, 11:46:27 PM] Gary Teh: The truly insightful aspects about Luba (my dance partner) from my perspective is last year, she had to abandon life as she know it by leaving with her mum and her dogs in her car to escape from Kiev 

She was originally thinking of just sticking around but after running up and down multiple times within a day to seek refuge in the bomb shelter at the basement of her apartment she finally gave up on sticking around

There were multiple occasions she had to swerve her car 180 just to avoid being hit by an exploding shell which went off less than 200 meters away from her car

When prodded further (kind of cruel of me she actually broke down in tears in front of me at the dinner table when I did that), she mentions she still sometime wakes up from her nightmares at night trembling in fear that she would lose her dogs and mum, the only things she left that she love. On these occasions she would go sit and hug her dogs for hours until she fell asleep again 

Europe has granted she and her mum asylum status with temporary visa which renews every year. There is a small community of them living together in southern France 

She is hoping to head home soon but have no idea when that would happen. Lagging any certainty, her life is hanging in the limbo 

She been practicing Shad Guru’s inner engineering which @5511982667030 has been a big fan of, for the past 4 years. 

I actually wonder if she would coped differently if she hadn’t done so

[2/27/23, 5:55:56 AM] Gary Teh: Had this insightful conversation on the side with @5491125130580 just now which I thought might be “useful” to share here 

The general ratio of men to women on the ballroom dance is basically 1 men is to 5 women. 

While the ratio of men to women in regular dance clubs is 5 men to 1 women

The uneven distribution is very awkward 

General complains from women on the ballroom dance floor here in South America 

1. Men generally don’t know how to dance. Mainly because they refuse to learn it as it’s not consider manly

2. Women are sometimes forced to dance the role of “men” during ballroom dances due to the general lack of male dance partners

3. They are kind of tired of having to play “men” on ballroom dance floors. It’s opposite of their intention of coming to the ballroom dance floors in the first place which was to feel like “woman” again, especially when modern workplace has been designed to incentivize masculine behavior

[2/27/23, 5:57:52 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be the same general feedback I had from @5511982667030 when she came visiting in the US a few years ago during which we went for tango lessons together in Palo Alto 🤔
[2/27/23, 6:01:25 AM] Peter Peng: They should serve lots of alcohol at ballroom dance and I’m sure men will be there 😂
[2/27/23, 6:01:27 AM] Tres Garcia: 1. The continuation of rail services for the nation > needs of the town. This seems pretty obvious to me after playing years of SimCity. It’s like SimCity 101. 
2. Hazardous chemicals and you stayed? May want to evaluate your decision making process. 
3. I’m hearing you can’t trust the governor or local help…. So what will the Pres Visit accomplish? He is a man… not a magician. 
4. Leave Ohio for greener pastures.
[2/27/23, 6:02:09 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way we’ll want to dance

[2/27/23, 6:09:20 AM] Peter Peng: Why is ballroom dance a feminine thing?
[2/27/23, 6:10:01 AM] Gary Teh: I would assume it has to do with All the swaying off the butt for side to side and the flowery flourishes
[2/27/23, 6:10:03 AM] Peter Peng: I thought it was originally intended for a man and woman.
[2/27/23, 6:10:42 AM] Peter Peng: I think that it’s more of a classy thing
[2/27/23, 6:11:13 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why there are more women 😂
[2/27/23, 6:11:48 AM] Gary Teh: Perception shifts across generations

All the Hollywood super hero marketing of how “masculinity” should be interpreted has probably not been very helpful
[2/27/23, 6:12:03 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just picturing you dancing like this now 💃

[2/27/23, 6:14:27 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective Actually just like hacking (white hat studying how black hat do their stuff), to first dance well you need to spend time studying how both the men and women moves

Only then the dance lead understand what is the most enjoyable and also creative next move in the dance
[2/27/23, 6:15:32 AM] Peter Peng: Sounds like “next move prediction” generative AI model for robots o

[2/27/23, 6:26:15 AM] Gary Teh: After two weeks out at sea, I am starting to be of the opinion cruises are really good way to know more people 

They are way more effective than general networking where people bump into one another and then leave sometimes never to meet again 

In a cruise, you keep on bumping into another during separate events over the duration of the cruise

New relationships are allowed to form naturally 

The way the ecosystem is naturally setup feels like the one experienced at the house of balance in Davos Switzerland when I was there this past two years

[2/27/23, 6:48:21 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: true. and some of them quite desperate to get a dancer 😅
[2/27/23, 6:51:55 AM] Gary Teh: Too self conscious perhaps? 🤔

I remember spending the first few days studying the physical movements of couples on the dance floor to figure out the underlying principles before finally inviting my first partner to the floor. 

Or more accurately she (Luba) just invited herself. 

I remember finally getting the “aha” moment one evening, and then feeling someone tapping me on the shoulder just when I was relaxing from the concentration of studying and mimicking someone else’s movement. 

Turning around to see her and then transitioning into a coupled dance with her just felt like the most natural thing to do especially when the next music was just starting

Maybe she has also been studying my movements 🤔
‎[2/27/23, 6:52:13 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/27/23, 6:53:34 AM] Peter Peng: You had a real “Titanic” moment here 🚢
[2/27/23, 7:04:44 AM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Barbara from south Brazil who mentioned the same thing that @5511982667030 mentioned as well 

Somehow the men women ratio here in South America is skewered. There are women than men for reasons unknown 

This same phenomena was observed in Russia. The reasons were more known there though. Alcohol, drug abuse and suicide occurs at a much higher rate in men in those regions. 

Somehow being burdened to shoulder the default role of the “provider” since young actually imposes a lot of psychological load. 

It made sense in the agrarian and the hunter gathering age where having more physical strength did give an advantage. This is not necessarily the case in our current Information Age where being relationship oriented is what provides the advantage. This becomes especially more true as more and more of our work gets automated away leaving what is becoming increasingly more human relationship focused occupations 

From my personal experience being slightly on the autistic spectrum, when a social network becomes denser and  interweaved, the pattern of human relationships becomes more intricate. Beyond a certain threshold I just have to back off and move myself to the edge where there are more free yet defined space. 

You can think of it as being a kind of color blindness. Some people, like Ilya, cannot see the color green with their eyes however hard they try because it’s not in their programming. Others like myself can’t seem to interpret a certain category of more subtle social cues even though it might be glaring obvious to most folks not in the spectrum 🤔

[2/27/23, 7:18:41 AM] Gary Teh: I recall @6594897484 and @5511982667030 mentioned a few times calling me “strong” for being able to handle extended periods of isolation, uncertainty and going totally against social norms (aka social cues)

Actually that is not really case of being “strong” it’s just how the gene was expressed in this body. 

Obviously there are trade offs and as mentioned before (inability to read more intricate social cues)

What I have found to be truly fascinating is how it even showed up in the Bazi readings where bulk of my compositions is in the Seven Killings (七杀) position. The kind of profile you would deploy to remote unknown terrains that are uncharted to do the discovery work before the rest of civilization moves in under the leadership of someone else 🤔

[2/27/23, 7:37:53 AM] Gary Teh: Checking out of Marriot hotel now (Elton has been really kind to share his suit with us yesterday) 

Finding myself a hostel to check in now. Back to being the Hobo 🤣

Seems he is planning to do vanlife next year in North America after finishing South America this year. 

He is going to speak with his friend about the sailboat purchase from Hawaii for resale in Jakarta once he gets back to Indonesia this October. 

If it works out then most likely we will carry out our plan in 2025. Likely Luba is going to help us captain the ship since she has been a sailor competing in the Olympics for Ukraine. Both her parents were sailing competitively as well 🤩

On a side note, the same “hobo and resource leader” pattern seems about to start repeating itself yet again. 

The hobo goes in to the unknown to figure out the patterns and the resource leader comes in and foots the bill by pulling together the resources required for executing crazy idea discovered via the patterns figured out by the Hobo. Meanwhile the Hobo dumps all the resources discovered along the way to the resource leader to go figure how to manage 🤣
[2/27/23, 8:06:45 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Being a bit of the opposite. Less intelligent, but capable to grasp social interactions in split seconds and on many different layers, I am just learning that it does not matter. Knowing, seeing and understanding others desires does not get you anywhere. Because it is all about living who you are, pleasing others by just being 100% authentic, making being yourself happy. This authenticity we can only find ourselves. You only have to express yourself. If others don’t understand, it is not your falt, it might just not be for you. So if you are color blind, are you missing anything? I guess your favorite color would be one you can actually see. Or it is one nobody else can see. Either way, you have reason to be happy. Just to be able to adapt to the rainbow, does not help you to find your favorite color. Making any sense at all? 🤪

[2/27/23, 6:04:43 PM] Gary Teh: Based on what I have observed 

Personally from an energy perspective these are the four categories of communications and their respective quota 

1) there seem to be a unlimited quota when it comes receiving and sending written communications. Structured or otherwise unstructured 

2) The same could be said about listening to someone verbally express an structured idea he/she has in his/her head

3) my energy level on a regular day seem to be able to sustain well beyond 10000 words when required to verbally communicate about a structured idea I have in my head 

4) my energy level for the day seem to get fully depleted in under 1000 words when required to verbally communicate with no fixed clearly defined goals (no idea why we are even having this conversation scenario). 100 words in and you start observing me visibly sourcing for the exit before I have to be carried out on the stretcher 🤔🤣

I am always very impressed when I observe how “sales” folks can go on revving about seemingly random and generally disconnected topics for hours. Perhaps I still haven’t really figured out the underlying principle for being able to perform this feat 🤔

[2/27/23, 6:21:20 PM] Peter Peng: Twitter doing bad, Tesla doing bad
[2/27/23, 6:22:28 PM] Gary Teh: Same exact principles dude. 

I utilized some of them on a smaller scale many years ago when working in the publicity and entertain industry back when I was in Singapore to keep the crowd engaged and to ensure the marketing message gets delivered across

First the shock and awe (hopefully laughter of disbelief) and then the slight nudge to imprint the messaging in the head of the target
[2/27/23, 6:24:21 PM] Gary Teh: Usually the messaging needs to be so dumbed down, any regular Joe with an IQ of less than 80 can recall it.
[2/27/23, 6:24:35 PM] Peter Peng: I guess, I don’t find him, Trump or Kanye West relevant anymore

[2/27/23, 6:25:54 PM] Gary Teh: You are technically borrowing the energy derived from the laughter to do the psychological imprinting. Think of it as transaction fees 

Other marketeers utilize “sex” since that also temporarily drive up energy level, sufficient enough for the cognitive imprinting of that dumb down message
[2/27/23, 6:27:21 PM] Gary Teh: It already is, haven’t you heard of bridge waters?
[2/27/23, 6:27:38 PM] Peter Peng: Media is just making a spectacle out of him lol
[2/27/23, 6:34:58 PM] Gary Teh: That is how he drives the viral loop. 

Folks who do not share his belief will ridicule him when they revive the media messaging 

Folks who share his belief will gravitate and support him when they receive the same exact messaging from the same media 

Unless you have spent time tuning your brain to counter your natural disposition we will end up strengthening our beliefs in what we want to believe anyway when presented with a stimulus 

Hence what @6590995199 been talking about when he mentions he need to present contradictory evidence to disturb a person belief. his intention is to help the receipts develop TrueSight (the ability to see what you don’t already believe even if you might choose not to use it for future decision making purposes) 

He is not being argumentative when he does that

The OGs members were brought into this DAO with the deliberate goal of creating such contradictory scenarios

[2/28/23, 5:51:18 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: So, I'm not worried about you. You're picking up on the information here in the chat and the different opinions. And you're involved in practically every topic. It's not about the amount of words. That can't be a measurement.

What about non-verbal communication? What is the importance of what is not said? There we humans are perhaps differently gifted, as far as the evaluation is concerned. Visually, non-verbal communication can be perceived and translated very well, but in writing it can hardly be captured. Or does Edgar read between the lines? It becomes political here in the chat from time to time and I know that I belong to an unloved minority. Why should I express myself?

What makes Edgar out of much and of little comments? How does it come to the balance that we have already discussed when there is different amounts of communication? How do we distinguish between smalltalk and the core of the message. Schiller once wrote in a letter to Göthe (perhaps it was the other way around): "sorry dear friend, I had no time to be brief."  

simply to throw a few more thoughts into it... It looks like I am not quick enough to follow all conversation
[2/28/23, 5:57:11 AM] Gary Teh: Irony is something that machines can’t fathom yet since a huge portion of it has to do with the contradictory body language
[2/28/23, 5:57:35 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding what is not being said, it is at times way more important than what is already said. Remember William Shakespeare’s Macbeth where the witches convinced him to murder the king by stating what is the truth. But since critical facts were omitted during the presentation it only amount half truths
[2/28/23, 5:58:19 AM] Peter Peng: I love non verbal communication 😏
[2/28/23, 6:00:27 AM] Peter Peng: The truth is… everything is a lie
[2/28/23, 6:03:00 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/28/23, 6:04:58 AM] Peter Peng: Your mere existence is fabricated
[2/28/23, 6:05:33 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding belonging to an “unloved” minority 

I remember the conversation I had with @6596983014 last year when we were exploring NFTs. He had been contributing incremental derivatives towards that initiative and then scoring minor increments of governance tokens 

We finally had a chat with @14084823806 after trying to get in touch with him for two months, he immediately identified a few critical flaws in the artistic approach and tore everything  apart. We had to scrape the bulk of the concept and start from scratch. Talk about rocking the boat. His governance tokens holdings made a huge leap. 

@6596983014 asked why was @14084823806 given such a huge governance grant? The response, the flaw was sitting there for multiple weeks and it was only @14084823806 who pointed it out 

Another scenario was when @14075792560 joined our room last year. Him being himself utilizing Degen persona for communications here helped rocked the boat and catalyzed our thinking on what should be and not be encouraged in this space. That rocketed him to become one of the governors 🤔🤣

[2/28/23, 6:23:06 AM] Peter Peng: Keep life interesting
[2/28/23, 6:25:08 AM] Gary Teh: Still feeling too chilled to want to move my ass by bringing out my MacBook to come up with new adjusted slides for the talk during the get together me and @5491125130580 are helping organize here in Buenos Aires next week 🤔🤣

I guess I must truly be becoming a vegetable 

Somehow life still feels interesting
[2/28/23, 6:25:13 AM] Iwona Fluda: Or maybe this is when life becomes very exiting.
[2/28/23, 6:25:27 AM] Gary Teh: True as well 🤩

[2/28/23, 6:30:38 AM] Gary Teh: I wonder if ChatGpt might be able to help create PowerPoint slides and images 

The best case scenario is I verbally talk with ChatGpt and it just simply returns a few options and then I verbal tell it the adjustments I want made and then… voila done!!
[2/28/23, 6:30:50 AM] Peter Peng: It can
[2/28/23, 6:30:56 AM] Peter Peng: SlideGPT
[2/28/23, 6:32:21 AM] Gary Teh: That would be a great use case 

Just contact @14152032783 to see if he could help make introductions for São Paulo

Will utilize the same set of materials there

All these are for promoting the AID framework that we recently voted to include in our DAO space
[2/28/23, 6:42:48 AM] Gary Teh: Human dynamic wise, I been noticing this recurring pattern  across the previous few working groups I have been in 

Bulk of the time, I am the one mainly involved in figuring out the feasibility potential of an idea and perhaps help slice up the work and distribute it to interested parties 


Human interfacing issue wise back when I was in Singapore @6581766589 handled it for the team that were setup

In the previous company, it was basically all offloaded to Jerry. 

Seems in this DAO, the last time we had some really severe issue, @6594897484 was the one that mediated it. @16468233438 seem to be really good at it as well 


Regarding the task master profile. Ambarish was mainly playing that profile 

Right now in our DAO, I observe @5511982667030 and @918017107841 to naturally fall into this profile 

As for human resource leader profile that bring in a lot of folks, I observe we have a very healthy population of these folks

@19514467219 @48606646246 @2348123243309 @491736386942 @6596168016 @16468233438 @14152032783 @12063955455
[2/28/23, 6:43:48 AM] Gary Teh: And off course the folks that keep us out of legal trouble @41791555798 and @381644913030
‎[2/28/23, 6:49:17 AM] Garis Pang: ‎video omitted
[2/28/23, 6:53:46 AM] Gary Teh: Feasibility check wise I observe @12023686334 falls nicely into this profile too

[2/28/23, 7:24:20 AM] Aléksa: Hello Francois, yes that would be great!
[2/28/23, 7:24:57 AM] Francois renet: What is the best contact to give him?
[2/28/23, 7:25:12 AM] Tres Garcia: Funny he didn’t mention the back doors built into TT to access your phones features. (Camera & Microphone, contacts & other pii data)
[2/28/23, 7:29:41 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Sounds interesting. Yes, thank you.

[2/28/23, 7:49:00 AM] Gary Teh: Buenos Aires, Argentina 

A night at the hostel here cosy around USD15. So that amounts to around USD450 a month

A meal typical cost around USD8. Since I usually have around two meals a day that is around USD16

So you are looking at around USd1000 base cost

Transport here is less than a dollar

@14075792560 or @12023686334 anyway for you to check the exchange rate for selling Argentinian pesos at the JFK airport for USD?

I was chatting with Elton the other day if the local exchanges in JFK are willing g to buy the pesos for anything less than 290 pesos per USD, we could technically setup a supply run to exploit this exchange rate discrepancy and top up our DAO’s coffers

[2/28/23, 8:45:48 AM] Peter Peng: Why JFK specifically?
[2/28/23, 8:49:46 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be to the cheapest flight on the east coast 

Also since of you are there, it is pretty convenient 🤣

Flying in and out of sF or LA seem cheap but don’t know anyone in our DAO based in LA right now. 

Don’t remember seeing an exchange in SFO the last time I was there
[2/28/23, 8:59:06 AM] Tres Garcia: If you are flying physical cash you will need to declare anything over $10k
[2/28/23, 8:59:31 AM] Tres Garcia: Is Miami cheaper?
[2/28/23, 9:00:04 AM] Gary Teh: Around the same price
[2/28/23, 9:00:14 AM] Gary Teh: Actually cheaper by USD100
[2/28/23, 9:01:15 AM] Peter Peng: Crypto seems easier
[2/28/23, 9:01:29 AM] Tres Garcia: Why not Fund a stable coin address and find an off taker in Argentina? Will save you on the flight costs
[2/28/23, 9:01:48 AM] Peter Peng: You read my mind

Peter beat me to the delivery
‎[2/28/23, 9:01:57 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/28/23, 9:03:26 AM] Gary Teh: We still need to transport the Argentinian peso we received and on-ramp it to USDT somewhere
[2/28/23, 9:04:25 AM] Tres Garcia: From 
Ihatetaxis.com 
1 ARS = 0.13 USD
Commission Rate is 2.5%
[2/28/23, 9:05:26 AM] Tres Garcia: I wonder  if your bank would give you a better exchange rate
[2/28/23, 9:05:56 AM] Gary Teh: So the exchange rate is 1USD for 7 pesos?? 🤔
[2/28/23, 9:06:20 AM] Peter Peng: Roughly
[2/28/23, 9:06:21 AM] Tres Garcia: 🫠 as long as you can decalaire the source of funds for over $10k…. Yeah… you could do that.
[2/28/23, 9:06:49 AM] Tres Garcia: They don’t have a bitcoin vending machines down there?
[2/28/23, 9:07:03 AM] Gary Teh: Still need to fly in to the US with the Argentinian pesos right to on-ramp to USDT right??
[2/28/23, 9:07:36 AM] Peter Peng: Seems like a hassle
[2/28/23, 9:08:14 AM] Gary Teh: Adding additional steps that seems to complicate the transaction chain with not much value add 🤔
[2/28/23, 9:08:39 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah
[2/28/23, 9:09:00 AM] Tres Garcia: I was thinking of:
Work remote and get paid in USD to your bank account. 

Use USD to buy stable coin (transaction fee = low or no fee)

Use coin to purchase Pesso locally. 

Then upload to take advantage of the speard.
[2/28/23, 9:09:19 AM] Gary Teh: Meh… Not interesting 🤷‍♂️
[2/28/23, 9:09:20 AM] Peter Peng: Unless you are getting paid by some drug kingpin to move the money
[2/28/23, 9:09:34 AM] Peter Peng: Then it might be worth it
[2/28/23, 9:09:38 AM] Peter Peng: Seriously
[2/28/23, 9:09:43 AM] Tres Garcia: My point exactly!
[2/28/23, 9:09:56 AM] Tres Garcia: 😂🤣😂
[2/28/23, 9:10:05 AM] Tres Garcia: But yeah…. Not worth it
[2/28/23, 9:10:07 AM] Gary Teh: @381677448972 is helping make some introductions right now in Buenos Aires 

Let’s see what the rates are
[2/28/23, 9:10:14 AM] Peter Peng: This is where I thought he was going with it
[2/28/23, 9:11:03 AM] Peter Peng: I would love to rob a drug kingpin from South America if I had the chance
[2/28/23, 9:11:49 AM] Tres Garcia: Do You got plans for the weekend? 😎
[2/28/23, 9:12:29 AM] Peter Peng: CIA special operation
[2/28/23, 9:13:11 AM] Tres Garcia: No way! I want the operation to succeed. 🤣😂🤣
[2/28/23, 9:14:03 AM] Peter Peng: The CIA would just turned the seized cocaine into crack and redistribute it in Washington DC
[2/28/23, 9:14:22 AM] Peter Peng: Not a bad business model 😂
[2/28/23, 9:14:30 AM] Tres Garcia: From the book American Gods: “How do you know the CIA didn’t kill JFK?…. Because He’s dead.”
[2/28/23, 9:15:14 AM] Peter Peng: The CIA used the KGB
[2/28/23, 9:15:35 AM] Peter Peng: There are many levels to this
[2/28/23, 9:17:17 AM] Tres Garcia: Have you read “11/22/63” by Stephen King? Great book. They even did a show on Hulu.
[2/28/23, 9:17:26 AM] Tres Garcia: I think you’d enjoy it
[2/28/23, 9:17:39 AM] Peter Peng: No, but I should
[2/28/23, 9:18:54 AM] Tres Garcia: Great article
[2/28/23, 2:53:20 PM] Gary Teh: This makes me really curious to go visit Venezuela after Brazil 🤔

So much to unpack here.
[3/1/23, 5:22:23 AM] Gary Teh: I remember talking about the unpredictable emergent properties of networks. During the talk I was more focused on human networks

Apparently the same is true for neural networks

[3/1/23, 8:33:21 AM] Gary Teh: There are a few steps after this. 

- migrate all our outstanding governance tokens to a common shared vault wallet. So that all future issues can be voted on and approved by all DAO members who hold governance tokens

- sink our outstanding 5000 USDT to our liquidity pool so that an exchange rate between the USDT in our treasury is automatically established with all TDG tokens that have been issued

Once these two final steps have been established DAO members should be able to freely contribute to our DAO, earn governance tokens and then cash these out in USDT.
[3/1/23, 8:33:30 AM] Gary Teh: 🤩👍🏻
[3/1/23, 8:34:26 AM] Gary Teh: Once all these steps are done, it should mean that if I went exploring the Amazon forest sometime next month and some giant size anaconda accidentally gobbles me up, our DAO will still go on without any issues.
‎[3/1/23, 8:35:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/1/23, 8:39:12 AM] Peter Peng: What’s the incentive for people to buy the TDG tokens?
[3/1/23, 8:39:48 AM] Gary Teh: Right now none. Since none of our projects are working 🤔🤣
[3/1/23, 8:40:28 AM] Gary Teh: From a pure profit and loss perspective The only motivation is good will or insanity 🤣
[3/1/23, 8:40:29 AM] Peter Peng: Fair enough lol
[3/1/23, 8:42:34 AM] Peter Peng: I still think a whitepaper would help
[3/1/23, 8:42:39 AM] Gary Teh: So all the folks who have contributed this ecosystem so far and have their names listed on our ledger are either insane enough to believe it is possible to create a better world based on verifiable truth or have enough goodwill towards the insane ones who are doing so
[3/1/23, 8:42:57 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to contribute to this insanity 🤣
[3/1/23, 8:43:23 AM] Peter Peng: I would not know where to start 😂
[3/1/23, 8:43:51 AM] Peter Peng: It’s easy to create mine because I’m just trying to get the vision out of my head

[3/1/23, 8:45:44 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah, you need to be obsessed about solving the problem
[3/1/23, 8:46:47 AM] Gary Teh: I feel the only thing I am really obsessed with is not have shitty information sent my way and causing me to make stupid decisions with my time, effort and money
[3/1/23, 8:47:46 AM] Peter Peng: You’ll have to articulate that along with your plan of action in a whitepaper and distribute it
[3/1/23, 8:48:08 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way I see the token growing
[3/1/23, 8:48:55 AM] Peter Peng: Even then it’s a hit or miss if it resonates

[3/1/23, 9:03:34 AM] Gary Teh: I remember having to navigate similar situation when our DAO executed a barter trade (of my time) with Daoveral group (their resources) early last year

They were applying a lot of pressure to centralize the ecosystem through me so that it could be controlled by them. The holdings were still very centralized then (I had more than 35% voting rights versus 7% voting rights right now)

The way we got around the situation was for me to stake away all my voting rights to members of choice during the entire duration of the barter trade
[3/1/23, 9:06:38 AM] Peter Peng: Would be easier to have just exchanged tokens
[3/1/23, 9:06:45 AM] Gary Teh: So I ended up staking my voting rights to members with a strong independent minds and critical thinking

These served as a nice counter balance to the excessive pressure on their side to centralize the ecosystem under command and control directives.

Once it was done, I could just conveniently provide the response that my voting rights were none-existence in the DAO when receiving request for centralization, please speak to the other governors 🤣
[3/1/23, 9:07:56 AM] Gary Teh: Hindsight 20/20.

They didn’t want the utility of the ecosystem

Instead they needed a COO profile to go help their setup some of their projects organization structure
[3/1/23, 9:08:37 AM] Peter Peng: I guess, doesn’t sound like a real DAO
[3/1/23, 9:09:23 AM] Gary Teh: The original Group behind Daoversal was not a real DAO. That was a first thing I discovered when I arrived in Dubai.
[3/1/23, 9:10:22 AM] Gary Teh: Neo, the main guy in charge was always talking about some pump and dump scheme. It was just disturbing to sit in and listen to some of their conversations.
[3/1/23, 9:10:50 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah unprofessional
[3/1/23, 9:11:08 AM] Gary Teh: I guess that is the problem when Cow Boy style Chinese business men meets Crypto. 
This shit is just prevalent across the whole Asia.

[3/1/23, 9:44:37 AM] Gary Teh: Not sure dude. They have been migrating their stuff across so many domains 🤣
[3/1/23, 9:44:48 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t keep track of them anymore
[3/1/23, 11:56:56 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 please chat with @41799155602 

I am here right now in the cafe drinking coffee with @5491125130580

@5491125130580 has enough Human Resources available here to setup a game development studio here based in Argentina 

@41799155602 is the CEO of earn.games which gets a lot of requests for game development, @41799155602team does not have enough in-house resources to do that

I think the both of your teams combining forces yields great synergy! 🤩

[3/1/23, 4:12:10 PM] Gary Teh: Had a great discussion with @5491125130580 just now where we speculated on the eventual PH of the water after all the ice bergs (fresh water) melts and all the surface run offs have driven the PH to be as acidic as could ever be. 

In that state is the PH acidic or alkaline? 

An acidic PH would mean a very different reality than an alkaline PH.
[3/1/23, 4:39:26 PM] Gary Teh: One of the alumni’s from the JFDI accelerator took our prediction market, portfolio management use case and did a full fledge implementation 😱

https://www.jezer0x.com/bw-post-mortem/

Outcome was they ended up hitting the same walls we discovered. The main between our approach and theirs, we discovered the walls by just manually testing the behavior before deploying crazy amounts of resources to pursue any build out 

I wished they had just reached out to seek collaboration. I would have happily shared all the insights we gained within the space with them. 

One of them was even involved in the crafting of the technical portion of our white paper (Nishanth the CTO)

His cofounder Krishna (the CEO) was just being strong headed as usual about doing everything alone using the zero sum game web2.0 approach. 

Oh well… 🤔🤷‍♂️

[3/1/23, 5:14:49 PM] Gary Teh: Another interesting pattern re-emerged during the conversation me and @5491125130580 had today at the cafe 

Key insight (I will probably get lynched by a lot of the women folks in this group for surfacing this but in the spirit of open discussion let’s go ahead 😣)

- there is an age old unspoken competition between the women folks in any social settings. And that is based on external aesthetics (use of glamour natural looks, accessories and clothes)

- based on this unspoken attribute, a hidden social hierarchy is established within a network 


Once the pain point of a demographic is established (can’t find dance partner), and the proposed solution (an individual labeled as a dance partner) is publicly social proofed by one occupying a position higher up in the social hierarchy (better dress or naturally endowed, etc… ), that solution will readily gain acceptance by those who self-perceive to be lower on the social hierarchy 🤷‍♂️

The label we use for this class of cognitive bias is called the Authority bias. And the psychological mechanism exploited is called social proofing 

This same pattern can be cross pollinated to other domains. 

1) Enterprise sales: Once an organization manages to bring in a top Fortune 500 client into the fold, the rest will easily follow along so long their budgets are within the same range

2) Fundraising: once a tier one investor is brought into the folder as the lead investor the tier two and tier three investors will naturally want to follow without much resistance 

Are there any other domains you can think of where this pattern is applicable as well?
[3/1/23, 5:42:31 PM] Peter Peng: I think it all comes down to what the individual values. Typically inner beauty will radiate outward but there are the exceptions.
[3/1/23, 5:44:27 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me, the same could be said about driving technology solution adoption within a decentralized community 

Once a figurehead has publicly endorsed a protocol, it quickly gains traction within the community

Simple example is Dogecoin
[3/1/23, 5:45:09 PM] Gary Teh: Jeff Bezos was probably the biggest gorilla in the room until recently when Elon Musk awarded him the silver medal on Twitter
[3/1/23, 5:45:42 PM] Gary Teh: Everytime Elon Musk publicly endorses the dog, Dogecoin shoots up
[3/1/23, 5:45:57 PM] Peter Peng: Not anymore though
[3/1/23, 5:46:29 PM] Peter Peng: He does it all the time now and the price of Doge stays the same, thank god

[3/1/23, 10:16:43 PM] Anita Lamprecht: This is so funny. Yes, the crowd just follows. I think it helps to simplify the decision making processes just to trot along the „higher ranking“ and seemingly more successful peers. Seems to be human. 
The dance partner story 😂… is funny though. I will share the wisdom of my mother with you. 😆 as a teenager she gave me the advice to pick the ugly ducklings as dance partners first … because then the more attractive guys feel more secure to approach me. Why? They don’t have the risk of being rejected as they feel to be higher ranking in social hierarchy.
[3/1/23, 10:17:56 PM] Gary Teh: I guess, I must have been the ugly ducking 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:19:22 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Was it a teenager’s dance? 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:19:54 PM] Peter Peng: I was always the shortest kid in my grade, so I always went for the prettiest since I had nothing to lose.
[3/1/23, 10:20:09 PM] Gary Teh: It now explains the phenomena observed in dance clubs in Singapore where somehow the short and fat guys seem to be dancing with the girls

Problem I observed though, they just kept dancing with the short and fat guys the whole night while all the tall strapping guys just stood at the side all night 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:21:04 PM] Anita Lamprecht: The guys then don’t get it.
[3/1/23, 10:21:15 PM] Gary Teh: Well… Half the dance partners were less than my age. 

So I guess I was the safe “Uncle” 🤣

[3/3/23, 10:02:38 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the cleanest approach moving forward proposed by @41799155602 last year surfaced again when our open format chat went further in the direction of governance today.


Our DAO will only be in charge of making sure the governance tokens still sitting within our treasury vault are issued  out based according to our commonly agreed upon rules (aka our rubric).

We will not hold or control any assets in our treasury. 

Anything happening out in the wild is beyond our scope, examples include
    - someone deciding to create a market between our governance tokens and some prevailing crypto-currency (via the serum protocol)
    - someone deciding to sinking funds into the market's corresponding liquidity pool to establish a prevailing exchange rate (via the raydium protocol)


Any successful project who has benefited from our DAO's early on support that wants to contribute back to our DAO can do so by staking USDT in the liquidity pool established between our governance tokens and USDT at their own discretion.

[3/6/23, 9:16:38 AM] Gary Teh: Hey folks, please be introduced to @12125181145 whom I got to know in Davos. 

The bunch of us spent a lot of time together helping make House of Balance a success during the event. She and I were manning the sound equipment station 🤩

Mary is going to walk me through two projects she is working on one in the healthcare space and the other quite similar to the John Wick’s Continental concept. I believe there is going to be much synergy moving forward 🙂🙏

[3/6/23, 11:46:22 AM] Mary Carbajal, B1OS: YES … however our weapons are our mind, heart and spirit!!! 🤗
Great to be here with you all … looking forward to learning, sharing and collaborating!
[3/6/23, 2:33:29 PM] Gary Teh: The AI space is moving really fast. Given the script and training data from existing anime series, the team was able to prime the Stable Diffusion AI library to create an entire animation series 

https://youtu.be/GVT3WUa-48Y

We do know that Users are right now already able to prime ChatGpt for a story 

If you out two and two together, you would have basically automated away an entire industry of creative workers 😱
[3/6/23, 2:40:02 PM] Peter Peng: I think it democratizes the creator economy and AI makes it easier for anyone to create.
[3/6/23, 2:40:29 PM] Peter Peng: I still believe that creative still have the upper hand in creating
[3/6/23, 2:47:37 PM] Tim Fong: I met at eth San Francisco an animation director who said that it empowers the director while removing the need for animators. Her thesis is story telling and prompt engineering will drive the space

[3/6/23, 2:50:06 PM] Tomas - Offchain: More creative decisions, less technical obstacles
[3/6/23, 3:00:53 PM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense, even I was tempted to just utilize one of the libraries (midJourney, StableDiffusion and Dall E) to create NFT art for the original series I had in mind for our game after I realize the artist friends  were busy or simply stuck in an impasse

[3/6/23, 3:03:48 PM] Gary Teh: Ended up cancelling everything after validating there no actually no market demand for the prediction market game 🤣
[3/6/23, 3:06:34 PM] Gary Teh: I believe @381677448972 DeGods game concept for an RpgGame would probably be more well received by the Web3 audience
[3/6/23, 3:23:27 PM] Tim Fong: You stood up the libraries yourself to generate these versus using the interface?
[3/6/23, 4:51:32 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah. It wasn’t rocket science  🤷‍♂️

Generally given enough time and effort anything can be built 

The general problem as usual is no market demand 

A lot more ideas were tested and killed than folks realized behind the scenes
‎[3/6/23, 4:58:12 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[3/6/23, 5:03:50 PM] Gary Teh: That is true. Clobbered them together via google search 🤣
[3/6/23, 5:04:12 PM] Peter Peng: Love it
[3/6/23, 5:04:36 PM] Peter Peng: Just throw them on Opensea already
[3/6/23, 5:04:49 PM] Peter Peng: In the rotten radish
[3/6/23, 5:04:51 PM] Gary Teh: Why bother wasting money paying for monthly subscription or server cost spinning up the machines when a simple manual test is enough to validate market demand
[3/6/23, 5:05:08 PM] Peter Peng: Dale is free
[3/6/23, 5:05:16 PM] Peter Peng: Dalle

[3/6/23, 5:10:47 PM] Peter Peng: And it actually very difficult to stand up the open source stable diffusion, I think devs put Easter egg problems in the code 👨‍💻 so not everyone can use the AI… same with my GPT models

[3/6/23, 5:12:02 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t blame you
‎[3/6/23, 5:12:41 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/6/23, 5:12:43 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just good at coding so it’s not that hard for me
[3/6/23, 5:13:12 PM] Gary Teh: Glad you enjoy writing code 🙂👍
[3/6/23, 5:13:29 PM] Peter Peng: Well you need to do it for yourself
[3/6/23, 5:13:47 PM] Peter Peng: Then people buy in
[3/6/23, 5:15:13 PM] Peter Peng: Like the $GPT whitepaper I made it for myself… I was suprised when people bought a few thousand dollars worth of token on the first day.
[3/6/23, 5:15:41 PM] Peter Peng: It was just something I took the time to do
[3/6/23, 5:15:47 PM] Gary Teh: I observe my needs recently are mainly electronic and mechanical engineering related, since bulk of my interest have shifted to off the grid living giving what I am seeing happening to our environment 

That is why I haven’t been writing much code. Much of the work is figuring out how to put the physical parts together and get them to work in the middle of nowhere 🤣

But since I am right now still slowly hauling my ass northwards from South America to the desert. Actual implementation work is still on hold
[3/6/23, 5:15:50 PM] Peter Peng: It’s about the energy put in
[3/6/23, 5:15:58 PM] Tim Fong: Do you have the source prompts for these?
[3/6/23, 5:16:14 PM] Gary Teh: You should ask @6596983014 🙂👍

[3/6/23, 5:19:01 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure the propellers are big enough
[3/6/23, 5:19:36 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe if it was made out of foam
[3/6/23, 5:20:08 PM] Gary Teh: The way I see it, helium should be what’s used to keep the ship afloat, propellers are just for stabilization and directional control 

https://fb.watch/j5dzasBzEw/?mibextid=4Y0WGk
[3/6/23, 5:20:51 PM] Gary Teh: Off the grid on international waters. 70% of the world’s surface area suddenly opens up and becomes available
[3/6/23, 5:21:10 PM] Peter Peng: That would be cool
‎[3/6/23, 5:21:32 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/6/23, 5:22:23 PM] Peter Peng: That was a good movie
[3/6/23, 5:22:59 PM] Gary Teh: Still trying to figure out the weight trade off ratio of floating solar power Bitcoin miners over international waters 

If that works, we are literally looking at setting up a parallel world order as to the ones US allies and the Chinese side are trying to impose on us
[3/6/23, 5:24:31 PM] Peter Peng: If you are woke, you go broke.
[3/6/23, 5:24:57 PM] Peter Peng: Basically the new rule of law
[3/6/23, 5:26:02 PM] Gary Teh: I hear that word thrown around by folks in the Bay Area a lot coupled with rolling eyes when they describe other folks in the ecosystem 

I still have no idea what that word really means
[3/6/23, 5:28:33 PM] Peter Peng: Basically the New World Order is complete
[3/6/23, 5:29:24 PM] Peter Peng: If you are off the grid, you’ll basically be broke
[3/6/23, 5:30:09 PM] Peter Peng: Even the spiritual grid
[3/6/23, 5:30:19 PM] Peter Peng: This is what I’m sensing
[3/6/23, 5:33:29 PM] Gary Teh: See you on the other side
[3/6/23, 5:33:35 PM] Gary Teh: 🫡
[3/6/23, 5:33:48 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to keep pace with innovation so I don’t go bankrupt hahaha
[3/6/23, 5:34:48 PM] Peter Peng: The wave is coming 🌊
[3/6/23, 5:36:18 PM] Peter Peng: If you aren’t trying to be a millionaire/billionaire getting a plot of land is good.
[3/6/23, 5:39:59 PM] Peter Peng: Lots of traditional VC funds aren’t able to raise new funds. The only two sectors are generative AI and Web3
[3/6/23, 5:40:36 PM] Peter Peng: I’m seeing the old web2 SaaS model dying
[3/6/23, 5:49:21 PM] Gary Teh: I remember Brian and our early investor Manish telling sharing a story about how when working back in Google Larry Page always nag at engineers to think more fundamentally about the problem 

With the changing world order as Ray Dalio described in his book, it makes sense to look beyond fiat denomination and examine the underlying resources when considering what is wealth. 

The fact that a plot of land can be worth USD0.01 cent per square meter one year and then sky rocket to around USD100 the next tells either one of two things 

1) It’s easy to get fiat rich. 
2) there is something fundamentally wrong about our valuation system and the seams are starting to come apart
[3/6/23, 5:51:16 PM] Peter Peng: I’m hoping that the Metaverse will be able to stabilize land prices
[3/6/23, 5:52:18 PM] Peter Peng: So people can make quick returns in the Metaverse
[3/6/23, 5:52:39 PM] Peter Peng: Vs. playing with real life land prices
[3/6/23, 5:53:58 PM] Peter Peng: This is my thought, but the Metaverse may not change anything at all 😂

[3/6/23, 8:30:57 PM] Tres Garcia: Both are great.
The US version is a little different… but just as good.
[3/6/23, 10:57:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not don’t have. No incentive to offer. Reward issues
[3/7/23, 2:52:04 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Even after fixing the reward issue with the jackpot concept (up to 25 million uSD for top player for the month) that you can up with still no one was interested 

That was when we decided to just can this idea and move on
[3/7/23, 3:11:01 AM] Gary Teh: But it’s been pretty amazing to see how all the various conceptual parts of this idea came together

I was only thinking of maybe someway of establishing a record on blockchain 

@6594897484 came into the picture and said the idea was shit. Focus on the trading buy sell signal instead 

Then @6598383264 came into the picture and looked at the idea and again said it was shit. It was missing the retention component and needed to be more Squid game like to be exciting 

Then @6590995199 who has a background in professional gaming came in and looked at it again and again said the idea was still shit. Introduced the jackpot component for the game 

I remember the rest of the folks were busy about to go develope the game when I figured that was risky resource wise for everyone so went ahead and tested the concept against our target audience before it was even built yet 

And finally figure despite best efforts, shit remains as shit. So just finally canned that piece of shit 🤣

the AI Virtual Summit 

These are the details below

THEME: The AI assemblage

SUB-THEME: Mastering the Age of Artificial Intelligence

VENUE: Telegram 

AUDIENCE INFO: Majority are web3 enthusiasts, techies, freelancers and students 

Their ages are from 17-25 years old

SPEAKING DURATION: 1 hr or less

DATE: March 22nd - 24th, 2023

TIME: 7 PM WAT daily (Nigerian-based)
[3/7/23, 4:42:06 AM] Gary Teh: Here's the TG channel: 

https://t.me/Conclave_Channel
[3/7/23, 4:42:42 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly will be speaking of the kind of use cases that I have surfaced already, as well as the ongoing concerns I had expressed earlier
[3/7/23, 6:15:34 AM] Gary Teh: Since the audience will be mainly African, will surface for discussion the lack of opportunity the African have to follow the path towards prosperity the Chinese had by being the low cost manufacturing destination. This is primarily because Robotics and AI is going to make a lot of the human labor redundant there
[3/7/23, 10:19:52 AM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 has officially lost his mind

[3/7/23, 11:26:20 AM] Peter Peng: Nice, the Brazilian version
[3/7/23, 11:26:46 AM] Gary Teh: In case, I get shot though, our vault management for our governance tokens is already in place. So our DAO will not be much impacted
[3/7/23, 11:27:34 AM] Peter Peng: You should list all tokens on the exchange
[3/7/23, 11:28:21 AM] Peter Peng: To become tradeable / liquid
[3/7/23, 11:28:42 AM] Gary Teh: It’s already in the process of being listed
[3/7/23, 11:29:05 AM] Gary Teh: Once that is up, The only part left is setting up the liquidity mining via Raydium
[3/7/23, 11:29:40 AM] Gary Teh: Beyond that folks here could freely define what our governance tokens mean and go crazy on it 🤩
[3/7/23, 11:30:49 AM] Peter Peng: Haha I guess
[3/7/23, 11:31:11 AM] Peter Peng: Usually you need a project

[3/7/23, 1:16:46 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/7/23, 1:17:41 PM] Gary Teh: Also I am noticing companies are trying to come into this space to provide software while charging an arm and a leg to support such kinds of community activities. 

I am at this point, really really tempted to start an open source software project that allows any community who are happy to manage their own servers to simply spin up their own systems to manage their own community tokenization activities just to counter balance this phenomena I am observing

A company that recently spoke to Tiff who is one of the community leader of house of balance was requesting for USD15K per month!?! 🤔

[3/7/23, 3:03:42 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : I was going to filter your pfp to that exact look!
[3/7/23, 4:04:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: No bro. The initial offer is too low. U offer 25million who won’t play u tell me
[3/7/23, 6:36:12 PM] Gary Teh: That is determined by how many number of people willing and interested to continue playing the game, month after month 

If people lose interest after a while and churn, then the jackpot size will not hit that amount. 

However problem is upon testing we realized people’s interest don’t sustain long enough for the compounding to happen
[3/7/23, 6:40:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: I know the algo bro. I designed it. 

All I am saying is. Your initial bait is not big enough. Hence don’t say compounding. You can’t even get the small fishes interested with almost a negligible bait
[3/7/23, 6:48:59 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe the game should have more enticing rules and a road map?
[3/7/23, 7:08:05 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah, the way I saw it given the lack of retention, it was unlikely it would last past the initial jackpot 🤔
[3/7/23, 7:08:19 PM] Gary Teh: Happy to revisit the assumption though 🙂👍
[3/7/23, 7:29:36 PM] Gary Teh: @8618926086648 @14152032783 and @5491125130580

The way I see, perhaps just as an extended experiment let’s see if we could run the same exact event in every single city between Buenos Aires and LA here in Americas which has an OffChain community presence as I head north while passing through overland 

That should really help refine the events planning specific section of the Rubric as well as energize the OffChain nodes 🤣
[3/7/23, 8:14:58 PM] Gary Teh: Should probably do the same too for the Eastern European block after I am done with Davos in Jan 2024

After the prior survey my sense is Eastern Europe is more interesting from the decentralized movement than Western Europe with the exception of Portugal
[3/7/23, 8:19:01 PM] Jonathan: This would be great. Though we don’t have much yet in Latin America we can try to set it up on the way
‎[3/7/23, 8:24:03 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/7/23, 8:52:12 PM] Peter Peng: Haha starting a DAO / Web3 project is like jumping off a cliff and not having enough parts for the airplane 😂
[3/7/23, 9:02:45 PM] Peter Peng: I’m finding that compared to Web2 we have to be extra scrappy
[3/7/23, 9:22:31 PM] Peter Peng: I also feel like I’m Web3 lots of companies don’t get acquired. I’m trying to understand if it’s because we are all still too early or that the Web3 model works well enough where small companies can co exist and thrive independently
[3/7/23, 9:22:41 PM] Peter Peng: *in Web3
[3/7/23, 9:29:11 PM] Peter Peng: Or all the companies end up going banks
[3/7/23, 9:29:17 PM] Peter Peng: Bankrupt
[3/7/23, 9:29:24 PM] Peter Peng: 😅
[3/7/23, 9:29:39 PM] Tres Garcia: I’m thinking the ownership & control is too sloppy. No VC wants to deal with “it’s a security…. It’s not a security”… unless it’s FOMO or 100x better
[3/7/23, 9:32:34 PM] Peter Peng: Traditional VC’s are having a tough time raising funds, Web3 VC’s seem to still be raising despite all the government regulatory fog
[3/7/23, 9:34:08 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not worried about the government, they pick and choose who they want to go after
[3/7/23, 9:36:58 PM] Peter Peng: It kind of reminds me of how the black market is run, but digital.

Figured I have got enough body fats stored to last a while
[3/7/23, 10:20:37 PM] Gary Teh: Heading to bed. Need to be up in a few hours for @12125181145 walk through of her two digital solutions, the AI virtual summit in Africa that @2348123243309 is hosting, coffee with @5491125130580 to walk through Friday’s plan and maybe some more tango lessons in the evening. 

Figured I should pack in as many lessons as possible before I head out 🤣

It’s really crazy how cheap it is when taking into account the exchange rates. Around USD2 per lesson 😱

[3/8/23, 7:58:25 AM] Gary Teh: Created a new deck that is focused on just the recurring constructs when I think about TrueSight DAO, House of Balance and OffChain Global

https://truesight.me/aid

I am thinking it might make sense to create a separate WhatsApp channel for folks participating in the upcoming series of talks who are keen to implement the AID framework for their own web3 projects

I believe there is much to be learned from them we could use to help further polish the AID framework

[3/8/23, 12:55:29 PM] Gary Teh: Very true. I believe it’s to do with knowing clearly what our DAo needs help with and then having the time and resource handy to help 🙂👍

[3/8/23, 3:50:01 PM] Tres Garcia: Doubt it…. I’ve never heard you distinguish your gender.

[3/8/23, 4:29:59 PM] Tres Garcia: No stated pronouns = can’t get excluded

[3/9/23, 12:58:30 AM] Gary Teh: Hey folks, was chatting with @918017107841 these past two days. 

Seems within various projects as well as in the main beer hall the ongoing discussions periodically surface very keen insights

She is proposing that we periodically summarize these into a Google doc of sorts where the contents get more structured and then grant access to them for another one who purchase a collection of NFTs we make available on our landing pages. This seem inline with what @19514467219 suggested about the Sunminy project while I was there in Zürich beginning of the year 

Meanwhile, as you might have correctly inferred, there is an initiative to redo our landing pages. The intention is to help people interested to repidly onboard to our DAO by providing an overview of what’s going on.

Seems this is a recurring theme surfaced by various DAO members @48691650760 @48606646246 @19514467219 @5511982667030 @16468233438 @918017107841 @41791555798 @5491125130580

[3/9/23, 1:26:32 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, after chatting with @5491125130580 just now we figured we should create a social mining group the attendees of Friday’s talk who are keen to further explore applying it in their project could join that group

https://chat.whatsapp.com/H6dYxbLULAq5ZHelXqQPAi?

If there are enough interest, we might spin it off as an open source software project with its code freely available on GitHub. 

We might then approach the various chains for grants to sponsor the building of this. The grants will be sunk into the liquidity pool we are establishing 

Developers who contribute to the codebase who be awarded governance tokens which could be cashed out via that liquidity pool
[3/9/23, 1:43:33 AM] Garis Pang: https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/csx-train-derail-injuries/index.html
[3/9/23, 1:46:23 AM] Anupa/diya: To place a background. The whole conversation started from the position and value of the community to the onbaoridng of the potential new Dao Members.

As seen, most whatsapp  groups are currently are  conversational mode. We are keen to know the intention and direction of each group.What kind of engagement would members like to participate or would people just want to keep sharing links and insights which is also fine. This will definitely define the purpose of the community and what we define on the website 

There is a lot of valuable resources in each group from my knowledge. Would we like to share "informal" research or just keep it within the groups. Sharing it as a knowledge base would open up much more dialog.

[3/9/23, 1:52:04 AM] Alessandro Mele: Oh wow great to hear, I just did it spontaneously!! 😃👍
[3/9/23, 1:55:30 AM] Alessandro Mele: Was at a conference last night hosted by the international law firm Withers and told them about the idea of creating a DAO to facilitate collaboration across the impact ecosystem and they were fascinated ! Lots of questions came up about governance, control, accountability and how to avoid unethical behaviour! I wish you were there and can’t wait to learn more about it myself ! 🙏
[3/9/23, 1:55:59 AM] Gary Teh: Autonomy is one of the core values of our DAO. And what you just did is exemplary of that 🤩

The other two values are Integrity and Diversity 

To the rest of the folks, I met @447887692903 when I was in Davos earlier this year. We had a long and deep discussion about the monopolistic issues with AI. 

Also had another deep discussions about building a neural network in a decentralized manner to access and value social impact projects which could then be turned into a SaaS service that impact funds could then pay for to use. The proceeds then paid out to community members who have helped trained the neural network 

This is the notion of AIs as property of the commons 🙂👍
[3/9/23, 1:57:17 AM] Gary Teh: Would have loved to have been there

DAO as governance framework is definitely gaining more and more traction 🙂

[3/9/23, 2:01:47 AM] Gary Teh: I was just having this chat last night with @5491125130580 at the cafe and privately on WhatsApp with @918017107841 just now

The most important component is the community core values 

All the follow up rules for ethical conduct then stem from those set of core values

This means two different groups structured with the same initial governance models but with different core values embedded might end up behaving very differently and evolve in different ways

That is one of the key things I observe when contributing to House of Balance, OffChain and TrueSight DAO
[3/9/23, 2:03:00 AM] Alessandro Mele: Amazing insights
[3/9/23, 2:11:18 AM] Gary Teh: And it is also the same set of core values that lead to the kind of projects that the community end up discovering and adopting
‎[3/9/23, 2:12:03 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/9/23, 2:14:17 AM] Gary Teh: The core values attract the kind of folks who these core values resonate with 

The folks then discover activities within their surroundings that allow them to actualize themselves (enacting their core values in their daily life)

In that regard, not very different from religion 🤔

[3/9/23, 2:23:18 AM] Alessandro Mele: Love it! I think each human on earth is on a journey of self realisation, the beauty of it is that it’s totally individual although we are all the same
[3/9/23, 2:25:16 AM] Alessandro Mele: I read the autobiography of a yogi and it’s really interesting! I have read the SRF Lessons and are a great way to understand the universality of human spirituality.
[3/9/23, 2:26:34 AM] Peter Peng: Self realization and self actualization show up in so many different ways and it’s not always as “butterflies and rainbows” which is the best part 😅
[3/9/23, 2:28:02 AM] Gary Teh: I was sharing with a friend that Steve Jobs really got it during his pilgrimage to India 

It’s really about actualizing your core values. Deep down Everyone know what theirs is if they really spend time to sit in stillness

In his case, it was Beauty. And that core value was actualized in Apple 

https://youtu.be/-z4NS2zdrZc

In hindsight, the reason for the exercise that @6598383264 got me to do for a whole month (literally sit and do nothing and just asking why even bother doing this) which he generally gets all the executive teams he advice to do is apparent
[3/9/23, 2:29:37 AM] Gary Teh: And Sometimes they actualize to become trillion dollar companies 🤣

He was asking me about the Russian Chinese conspiracy 

And I figured it makes more sense to drop him in here instead snd have the rest of the folks figure out what the conspiracy is 

I met him through an ex colleague back in Silicon Valley 

He does a lot of trading with his own trading guild
[3/9/23, 2:04:09 PM] Gary Teh: @15103667497 enjoy! 🤩👍

In case new folks don’t know, @16504369509 been working on building a DAO that utilizes our social mining framework to help build housing for the homeless in Oakland. 

houses are built using scavenged materials and volunteers time. When volunteers do so they are awarded tokens 🤩

Really happy with the progress made to the project 😊

[3/12/23, 6:45:27 AM] Peter Peng: We have to be, because we have the most power and responsibility (power corrupts)… give the game amoung of power to any other country and they would do the same. Why it works for the United States is because our immigration system has allowed us to become a microcosm of the world. A Petri dish per se as we have people from all nations living within our democracy and not under authoritarian rule like the other superpowers. If Free World fails, the rest of the world will surely fail.
[3/12/23, 6:45:43 AM] Peter Peng: *same power
[3/12/23, 6:48:33 AM] Peter Peng: For example, we needed to drop the bomb on Hiroshima to end the world war. Some may deem that as evil but it changed history forever and we have not seen a war like that since.

My sense is if such a methodology does exist, folks new to business development activities would find it reall useful.

[3/12/23, 9:28:32 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah you don’t have to think too much
[3/12/23, 9:31:58 AM] Gary Teh: Actually not true. 

I am just looking at the blockages experiences by the various projects I observe including the JETSON X project which we have token holdings in. 

The bulk of lack in progress is precisely this choke point. The lack of a effective pathway to the insiders. 

Until the IN is obtained, the project operators just remain as outsiders and end up wasiting a lot of waiting time 

One of TrueSight DAO’s core activities is RnD. And this recurring choke I observe happening across various projects on our radar deserves our attention
[3/12/23, 9:32:59 AM] Peter Peng: The NFT I gifted you?
[3/12/23, 9:33:28 AM] Peter Peng: JETSON X is not a project under this DAO
[3/12/23, 9:33:39 AM] Peter Peng: What project are you referring to?
[3/12/23, 9:34:11 AM] Gary Teh: The underlying project of the NFT 

How has the progress on that been? 

Also listening deeply to @918017107841 and @19514467219 feed back on lack of progress and engagement, my sense is this is actually the choke point
[3/12/23, 9:34:39 AM] Peter Peng: GPT protocol is underneath it
[3/12/23, 9:34:44 AM] Peter Peng: So going well
[3/12/23, 9:34:45 AM] Gary Teh: Since this DAO owns that NFT, we are technically shareholders to your project
[3/12/23, 9:34:59 AM] Peter Peng: Not really, I just gave you one lol
[3/12/23, 9:35:04 AM] Peter Peng: You didn’t purchase it
[3/12/23, 9:35:22 AM] Peter Peng: I was being nice lol
[3/12/23, 9:35:39 AM] Gary Teh: And I in turned gave it to the DAO

So as shareholders to your project, it is good as project lead that you periodically give updates on it to token holders 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:35:53 AM] Peter Peng: I do
[3/12/23, 9:35:57 AM] Peter Peng: Via email
[3/12/23, 9:36:30 AM] Peter Peng: GPT protocol is underneath it and I have actually shareholders underneath the LLC that put money into it
[3/12/23, 9:36:36 AM] Gary Teh: Do repost them here sometimes so that DAO members have an idea of what is going on with the underlying project behind that NFT

[3/12/23, 9:46:39 AM] Peter Peng: I gave it to you because I was nice
[3/12/23, 9:46:53 AM] Peter Peng: What exposure?

[3/12/23, 9:49:40 AM] Peter Peng: No one from there even talks in there
[3/12/23, 9:49:53 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to educate the DAO if anything
[3/12/23, 9:50:03 AM] Peter Peng: *from here
[3/12/23, 9:50:58 AM] Peter Peng: I work very hard on my projects, I don’t need you telling me that there is no activity
[3/12/23, 9:51:05 AM] Gary Teh: That is a conversion rate problem in your funnel and not an acquisition problem 

I have in fact been giving feedback on how you could properly structure your project too so that it’s more receptive to people in the know 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:51:40 AM] Peter Peng: Gary, you need to worry about your own project
[3/12/23, 9:51:47 AM] Peter Peng: Your tokens and liquidity
[3/12/23, 9:52:18 AM] Gary Teh: I am just giving you feedback as an advisor would. 

You are the project lead. It is up to your discretion on whether the input is useful and how to apply it if it is 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:52:22 AM] Peter Peng: I really just see this as a group chat, not a DAO project
[3/12/23, 9:52:29 AM] Peter Peng: You aren’t an advisor
[3/12/23, 9:52:29 AM] Gary Teh: Good inputs 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:52:57 AM] Peter Peng: Sure we are online friends but there is no working relationship here
[3/12/23, 9:53:03 AM] Gary Teh: Token and NfT holders technically end up being advisors
[3/12/23, 9:53:08 AM] Peter Peng: I just want to make that clear
[3/12/23, 9:53:24 AM] Peter Peng: No they don’t it was just a gift
[3/12/23, 9:53:47 AM] Peter Peng: Please don’t overthink it
[3/12/23, 9:53:48 AM] Peter Peng: Lol
[3/12/23, 9:54:02 AM] Gary Teh: So you are telling me your NFTs are worth nothing?
[3/12/23, 9:54:11 AM] Peter Peng: No people bought them
[3/12/23, 9:54:17 AM] Peter Peng: So they have value
[3/12/23, 9:54:26 AM] Gary Teh: Ok got it.
[3/12/23, 9:54:31 AM] Peter Peng: More people will join
[3/12/23, 9:54:43 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not creating some pump and dump
[3/12/23, 9:54:55 AM] Peter Peng: It takes time
[3/12/23, 9:55:39 AM] Peter Peng: Please learn some manners, if someone gives you a gift please say thank you and not complain
[3/12/23, 9:55:54 AM] Peter Peng: That was how my parent raised me
‎[3/12/23, 10:00:12 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 10:01:13 AM] Gary Teh: Such transactions on chain actually have significance especially when you are interacting with a DAO
[3/12/23, 10:02:33 AM] Gary Teh: and I did indicate clearly when you did the transaction I was accepting it the NFT on behalf of the DAO
[3/12/23, 10:03:26 AM] Peter Peng: Great, but again this doesn’t seem like a DAO to me
[3/12/23, 10:03:37 AM] Peter Peng: At first I thought it was
[3/12/23, 10:04:18 AM] Peter Peng: If I’m bringing on a DAO advisor it would be a DAO with a profitable and successful model
[3/12/23, 10:05:01 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I keep asking you how you are generating revenue
[3/12/23, 10:05:27 AM] Peter Peng: But at this point I’ve given up
[3/12/23, 10:05:44 AM] Peter Peng: And focusing on other areas and DAOs
[3/12/23, 10:05:49 AM] Gary Teh: Work in progress. Just like the business models of traditional startups 

Most don’t even generate any revue until into series A
[3/12/23, 10:06:35 AM] Peter Peng: I created my DAO and in less than a month already started generating revenue via the token
[3/12/23, 10:06:58 AM] Peter Peng: So you have no excuse
[3/12/23, 10:07:19 AM] Peter Peng: I am new to DAOs
[3/12/23, 10:07:47 AM] Peter Peng: I put in a lot of work, so that may be the difference
[3/12/23, 10:07:56 AM] Gary Teh: That is not technically revenue. Your sale of tokens fall under fundraising

If you create a startup and raised 1 million USD from your investors, you can’t technically claim that as revenue unless you are looking at it from a pump and dump perspective
[3/12/23, 10:08:26 AM] Peter Peng: It’s bringing in money
[3/12/23, 10:08:29 AM] Gary Teh: The revenue is only generated when someone paid to use the utility you have built
[3/12/23, 10:08:44 AM] Peter Peng: It makes it investable
[3/12/23, 10:09:32 AM] Peter Peng: Selling tokens are a mixture of investment/revenue
[3/12/23, 10:10:07 AM] Peter Peng: Because they can be used as utility within the system investors are looking at this as a performance metric
[3/12/23, 10:10:14 AM] Peter Peng: I’ve been speaking with them
[3/12/23, 10:10:15 AM] Gary Teh: Resources invested by investors don’t just come in money form

Some of TrueSight DAO’s investors invested their personal network into the DAO

And technically there are around three investors who are actively investing more than a thousand dollars worth of fiat every month
[3/12/23, 10:11:13 AM] Peter Peng: Great, put it into the coin
[3/12/23, 10:11:17 AM] Peter Peng: Or token
[3/12/23, 10:11:24 AM] Peter Peng: What’s what I don’t understand
[3/12/23, 10:11:47 AM] Gary Teh: These are already paid out as expenses dude
[3/12/23, 10:12:16 AM] Peter Peng: It goes into a central bank account?
[3/12/23, 10:12:36 AM] Gary Teh: The expense receipt are submitted and then notarized in exchange for tokens
[3/12/23, 10:12:51 AM] Gary Teh: Check the ledger 🙂
[3/12/23, 10:13:06 AM] Peter Peng: The ledge should be in chain?
[3/12/23, 10:13:11 AM] Peter Peng: On chain
[3/12/23, 10:13:56 AM] Peter Peng: Sorry maybe I’m not sure of the expenses or how you run the DAO
[3/12/23, 10:14:20 AM] Peter Peng: All I’m seeing is a guy living out of his car and traveling to Antarctica lol
[3/12/23, 10:14:39 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just here for the political chatter but not business
[3/12/23, 10:15:20 AM] Peter Peng: That’s just my perspective, but I’m only one person
[3/12/23, 10:15:46 AM] Gary Teh: Good inputs 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 10:17:05 AM] Peter Peng: Again, I’m not judging you
[3/12/23, 10:17:15 AM] Brian -IOM: Gary’s on his world tour! 🌎🏆
[3/12/23, 10:17:33 AM] Peter Peng: That’s awesome for him!
[3/12/23, 10:17:46 AM] Peter Peng: That’s why I’m here talking as friends
[3/12/23, 10:18:03 AM] Peter Peng: I think it’s cool
[3/12/23, 10:20:31 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t have anything this interesting going on in my life besides building my company JETSON X and GPT Protocol so I share it from time to time
[3/12/23, 10:20:47 AM] Peter Peng: But created my own channel to talk about it
[3/12/23, 10:21:02 AM] Peter Peng: As big to take away from Gary’s adventures
[3/12/23, 10:21:11 AM] Peter Peng: *not to
[3/12/23, 11:06:59 AM] Gary Teh: Much appreciated brother 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 11:14:08 AM] Peter Peng: No worries, you need to do what makes you happy
[3/12/23, 11:15:52 AM] Peter Peng: At some point you’ll want to make money
[3/12/23, 11:16:08 AM] Peter Peng: But now doesn’t seem like the time
[3/12/23, 11:16:09 AM] Johnson Teh: Dude, I reckon this lacks of action is called the missing of gathering …

Which is why I am still dead sure about property… until human can be wired to establish Nero-network (emotion) without meeting physically…  most cyber interactions will not have much impact 😜
[3/12/23, 11:16:52 AM] Juan Bernabó: Not yet... But for me this is a great new field of knowledge, research and development "energy based" social dynamics, marketing, innovation, where "vibes" are in the center of it as we shift from materialism to a more "information" and then energy based economy more and more we will see new businesses adopting this mindset it shows a breakthrough in terms of increase in value throughput per energy unit invested/time and helps explore new blue oceans
[3/12/23, 11:18:07 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, there is definitely an energy exchange. There have been people online that have given me millions of dollars. I certainly do care about those relationships.
[3/12/23, 11:19:06 AM] Peter Peng: Sometimes the memo does get missed for some.
[3/12/23, 11:19:46 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the hardest part, you’ll send out and update to thousands of people but the. Some people don’t get it even though they see it.
[3/12/23, 11:20:11 AM] Peter Peng: More and more business is going online so we must learn the new business practices
[3/12/23, 11:24:32 AM] Peter Peng: You are right that in person communication is better
[3/12/23, 11:27:54 AM] Gary Teh: In hindsight, it starts making a lot of sense the facetime sessions that @5511982667030, @918017107841 and @48606646246 periodically call for to discuss about various operational aspects of projects within our DAO.
[3/12/23, 11:31:18 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah I get on FaceTimes with people from GPT Protocol
[3/12/23, 11:31:32 AM] Peter Peng: But usually discussing business
[3/12/23, 11:32:10 AM] Peter Peng: TrueSight is the only group I come to cha
[3/12/23, 11:32:18 AM] Peter Peng: Chat for leisure
[3/12/23, 11:32:43 AM] Peter Peng: Even my own group is all business, I’m barely joking around
[3/12/23, 11:37:50 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished my hour long facetime session with @5511982667030, (me being very chatGpt with the thoughts in my head) she did come up with a very insightful prime. 

What is the value from my perspective of having such a chatroom like this beer hall in our DAO?

- a place to surface unknown unknowns via discussion. A lot of the topics surfaced here ends up becoming trends that inform what potential projects to pursue next

- a place where members of the DAO can come together to get to interact with each other in a generally informal setting

-  a place where useful information about DAO operations can be surfaced, discussed upon and eventually voted upon

- a place where members can have visibility into the kind of value that is exchange hands between various DAO members. In other spaces, a lot of these kind of exchanges are done in privacy so other members who might be able to jump in to participate ends up missing out because they don't know the deal flow is happening. In fact most of the introductions I made, they are done here in this channel except those that have some NDA concerns in place.

On the flip side though, as per the concern @918017107841 @5491125130580 @5511982667030 and @14075792560 rightfully raised, the context becomes really meshed up. 

One of the things that @5511982667030 left me to think about shortly before our facetime session ended is perhaps, it makes sense to extract some of those context and create separate channels for them instead.
[3/12/23, 11:39:45 AM] Peter Peng: I think you keep the “beer hall” the way it I and discuss business within the separate channels like Ecoverse etc.
[3/12/23, 11:40:25 AM] Peter Peng: You can still be part of other DAOs without it being underneath your DAO
[3/12/23, 11:40:32 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the beauty of it
[3/12/23, 11:40:55 AM] Peter Peng: That’s decentralization
[3/12/23, 11:41:22 AM] Peter Peng: Plus your excel sheet ledger seems very stodgy like a centralized bank
[3/12/23, 11:42:13 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I question if this is a DAO
[3/12/23, 11:43:14 AM] Peter Peng: Because many things seemed to want to be centralized
[3/12/23, 11:45:35 AM] Peter Peng: For example your issuance of token to members are not on the blockchain
[3/12/23, 11:46:04 AM] Peter Peng: Again I’m just one perspective
[3/12/23, 11:46:27 AM] Peter Peng: There is no perfect way to do it
[3/12/23, 11:48:37 AM] Gary Teh: One other thing which I have been considering in my head that @5511982667030 raised again today just a few days after @918017107841 did the other day, much as I try to prevent it from happening, seems "Gary" is fast evolving to become the default figurehead of this DAO (a public persona) though the DAO is supposed to be decentralized. 

And with every talk I end up giving on behalf of the DAO, the effect will only get more and more entrenched. 

it might start making sense to adopted the communication style that @8618926086648 uses in the OffChain channels he manages. To have a clear demarcation between what is personal and kept out of the channels and what is formal and utilized in the channels.

As @5511982667030, my usually contradictory style of communication on works In Real Life. Defaulting largely to just messing and joking around when not in meeting and operational context. And basically zero joking around within meeting rooms.
[3/12/23, 11:48:47 AM] Peter Peng: For all I know the numbers could all be fudged like a centralized bank 🏦 😂
[3/12/23, 11:49:56 AM] Gary Teh: Have you had the opportunity to checked out our vault management solution yet?

https://truesight.me/vault
[3/12/23, 11:51:43 AM] Peter Peng: Okay so have you distributed tokens to members and created liquidity pool?
‎[3/12/23, 11:51:51 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 11:52:21 AM] Gary Teh: Liquidity pool is still being setup.
[3/12/23, 11:52:31 AM] Peter Peng: You say you have $5k in USDT, maybe you should put that in treasury
[3/12/23, 11:52:43 AM] Peter Peng: Then people can vote on it
[3/12/23, 11:53:02 AM] Gary Teh: True. 🙂👍🏻
[3/12/23, 11:53:25 AM] Gary Teh: Planning to do that this coming week. Been so busy with the offchain planning this past week.
[3/12/23, 11:53:59 AM] Gary Teh: I already did mention this before.
[3/12/23, 11:54:07 AM] Peter Peng: Great, your DAO needs this type of governance since there is no blockchain project
[3/12/23, 11:54:27 AM] Peter Peng: You can use the funds to invest in projects
[3/12/23, 11:54:34 AM] Peter Peng: To create equity
[3/12/23, 11:54:50 AM] Peter Peng: Then your DAO becomes investable
[3/12/23, 11:55:17 AM] Peter Peng: Your traveling to Antarctica to see the ice caps melting doesn’t help me make money
[3/12/23, 11:55:21 AM] Gary Teh: Actually one of the things from my perspective, that the DAO needs to vote on is how much of the USDT should be shifted from our treasury to the liquidity pool once its up.
[3/12/23, 11:55:28 AM] Peter Peng: But finding projects to invest in does
[3/12/23, 11:56:04 AM] Peter Peng: Typically 50% goes to liquidity and the remainder goes to developing the product
[3/12/23, 11:56:26 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, it is not my responsibility to help you make money. You are a DAO member, you have the right to exercise your autonomy by figuring out how to make money and submit it as a proposal to the DAO
[3/12/23, 11:56:28 AM] Peter Peng: But since there is no product, then maybe more… but that’s up to you/Dao
[3/12/23, 11:56:46 AM] Gary Teh: I am just one of the DAO members.
[3/12/23, 11:56:52 AM] Peter Peng: I’m only saying if I invest in the DAO
[3/12/23, 11:57:11 AM] Peter Peng: Which I have not besides gift you an NFT
[3/12/23, 11:57:46 AM] Peter Peng: If my GPT project is a success I would invest in more projects and DAOs with the help of my group
[3/12/23, 11:58:04 AM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[3/12/23, 11:59:29 AM] Peter Peng: If I invest I. The DAO I would say, using DAO funds to invest in projects that can create a return would be key
[3/12/23, 11:59:56 AM] Peter Peng: Need ROI
[3/12/23, 12:00:08 PM] Peter Peng: But I’m just one person
[3/12/23, 12:00:23 PM] Gary Teh: You already did though you didn’t realize

We value not just money as investments. Investment of time and Energy into helping improve our DAO as well as introductions of key people with skill sets needed in our DAo are also considered investments. 

That is why there are line items in our rubric for that 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:00:31 PM] Peter Peng: If that’s not the direction you want to take it I’ll step aside
[3/12/23, 12:00:44 PM] Peter Peng: Money talks
[3/12/23, 12:01:02 PM] Peter Peng: And there will be investors that invest and not say a word
[3/12/23, 12:01:07 PM] Peter Peng: Like they did in mine
[3/12/23, 12:01:13 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 just gave an input that rather than we continue to flood this channel with our discussions 

Happy to bring it offline to chat with you privately if you are keen 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:01:22 PM] Peter Peng: It’s fine
[3/12/23, 12:01:38 PM] Peter Peng: I’m a financial investor
[3/12/23, 12:01:53 PM] Peter Peng: Cuts through the bullshit
[3/12/23, 12:02:39 PM] Peter Peng: But maybe you can just continue to run on sweat equity, but human capital also runs out
[3/12/23, 12:03:37 PM] Peter Peng: That energy being tied to currency is what makes it real
[3/12/23, 12:04:05 PM] Peter Peng: And allows you to participate in an economy greater than just the people in this grow chat
[3/12/23, 12:04:09 PM] Peter Peng: Group
[3/12/23, 12:14:55 PM] Peter Peng: Less running on fumes and more driving toward a working business model is what any investors wants to see.
[3/12/23, 12:15:18 PM] Peter Peng: May require discipline
[3/12/23, 12:27:20 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of real estate and Antartica 

I just summarized the findings from this recent physical survey I did on behalf of our DAO here on this LinkedIn post 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyjob_climatechange-space-activity-7040412768335777792-rJJo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios

As civilization disruption continues due to climate change and rising sea levels, we should expect some turbulence in real estates as governments are forced to move and create new cities for their citizens
[3/12/23, 12:29:01 PM] Peter Peng: They’ve been saying this for years
[3/12/23, 12:33:25 PM] Peter Peng: Well decades, since I was a kid
[3/12/23, 12:39:43 PM] Johnson Teh: Yes, 
but not to all nations and 
won’t be to all suburbs,

Some mother son is going to die this minute, it doesn’t matter as long it not you or me 😂 … can’t worry that universe will end in 50 years so don’t make money or invest… 

Reckon even if the world ending in 5 yrs time ppl will still want to make some money 😂
[3/12/23, 12:40:58 PM] Johnson Teh: In fact if you believe this is so. 
Then even more you should invest in property, just in higher region haaaaa
‎[3/12/23, 12:42:34 PM] Johnson Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 12:42:36 PM] Gary Teh: That was the point I was trying to make. 

When government moves cities, cheap land prices will suddenly sky rocket!
[3/12/23, 12:42:56 PM] Johnson Teh: Wanna buy some now??  🤑
[3/12/23, 12:43:31 PM] Gary Teh: Have you met up with @41799155602 and @971565972337 

They are based there 

I know Bilal who is very connected to a lot of shieks are based there as well
[3/12/23, 12:44:03 PM] Johnson Teh: Nope, none contacted me
[3/12/23, 12:44:31 PM] Johnson Teh: Let me add them 😊
‎[3/12/23, 12:46:39 PM] Johnson Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 12:51:12 PM] Gary Teh: Please do follow up. 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:51:19 PM] Gary Teh: Delicious
[3/12/23, 12:56:46 PM] Peter Peng: Exactly, paying bills, rent, payroll what most people are worried about.
[3/12/23, 12:56:55 PM] Peter Peng: Today
[3/12/23, 12:57:19 PM] Peter Peng: How do we help those people now.
[3/12/23, 12:58:02 PM] Peter Peng: How can we do it with Web3? Especially after the collapse of SVB
[3/12/23, 1:07:13 PM] Gary Teh: Actually @16504369509 is a good person to talk to. He has been helping mobilize the volunteer community in Oakland to build homeless shelters
[3/12/23, 1:08:58 PM] Peter Peng: I’m saying from a funding perspective
[3/12/23, 1:09:07 PM] Peter Peng: Lol they won’t be homeless
[3/12/23, 1:09:12 PM] Peter Peng: Hopefully
[3/12/23, 1:10:09 PM] Peter Peng: Homelessness is more of a societal issue vs. business/financial one
[3/12/23, 1:11:50 PM] Peter Peng: If these startups start moving more Web3 then DAOs can start to finance them
[3/12/23, 1:12:08 PM] Peter Peng: In the wake of SVB collapse
[3/12/23, 1:16:01 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective seeing it from a holistic civilization perspective, our current civil construct is failing an increasing population of our species as it continues to unfold 

I don’t really see societal and business/financial issues as different

Business and financial exist to ensure the resource required for the continued survival and prosperity of humanity is delivered. If these constructs fail their purpose then what is the point of even having this layer of abstract in the first place?? 🤔
[3/12/23, 1:16:40 PM] Gary Teh: Life can become simpler by removing them if they are not serving the needs of humanity
[3/12/23, 1:22:24 PM] Peter Peng: I believe societal issues are usually non-profit
[3/12/23, 1:23:09 PM] Peter Peng: Homelessness is usually dealt with via non-profit efforts
[3/12/23, 1:23:47 PM] Peter Peng: Which it should be
[3/12/23, 1:48:31 PM] Peter Peng: Profiting off of homelessness is not a good thing 😅
[3/12/23, 1:48:51 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 1:52:25 PM] Gary Teh: Just purely for the interest of discussion, what if we transcended beyond for-profit and non-profit, and consider things from a purely Darwinist perspective as proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book the selfish gene 

Obviously the specific set of gene expression (the individual) has not been very successful in extracting resources from the environment for its continued survival, much less the ability to prosper? 

For the greater good of the gene pool, shouldn’t it be just allowed to die off and the remaining resources it’s hogging returned back to the environment for recycling purposes? 

Why then the need for non-profit social initiatives to jeep the hopeless alive? Shouldn’t activities like Euthanasia instead be encouraged? 🤔

[3/12/23, 1:53:58 PM] Peter Peng: No, I think we should help them if we can
[3/12/23, 1:54:26 PM] Peter Peng: There are programs for it

[3/12/23, 1:58:20 PM] Peter Peng: The key is to help yourself so you can help others
[3/12/23, 2:01:33 PM] Peter Peng: Are you moved down there now?
[3/12/23, 2:34:06 PM] Gary Teh: Let me make the introduction too Farouq whose family exports oil from Kuwait to the U.S. 

Seems he recently left this channel too. Same feedback as @5511982667030 and @16468233438 and Franck (who also left the channel recently). 

Too much noise in here to be able to follow actual useful updates about the DAO. 

Definitely starting to feel like we might need to have a separate channel when only actual updates are published for folks who are only interested in news regarding our DAO operations

For now, let’s just use the announcement channel where only governors have admin access to 

I am sure we will figure out something once we had our discussion with @5491125130580 and @918017107841 to accommodate both updates as well as following discussions 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 2:43:41 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. Leaving on 16th March to iguazu 

I only stuck around to give the talk that @5491125130580 and @14152032783had kindly helped put together along with the OffChain community here in Buenos Aires  

The talk was on how our AId socio-mining framework came into being as our DaO evolved

From the profitability perspective of our DAO, the goal is to help onboard projects to this governance model and we in return acquire a chunk of their project governance tokens
[3/12/23, 2:45:17 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware OffChain is in the middle of arranging another gathering in Brazil where we get to the opportunity to share our AID socio-mining framework. 

And likewise the same when I visit Columbia thereafter

The synergy between these two DAOs is great 🙂👍

[3/12/23, 2:50:36 PM] Peter Peng: Are you planning on finding a place to settle in, have an apartment and open an office at some point?
[3/12/23, 2:51:23 PM] Peter Peng: I know you have aspirations of this DAO being able to take investments and act like a Web3 VC
[3/12/23, 2:53:56 PM] Iwona Fluda: None of the above, but always happy to talk to investors 😂
[3/12/23, 2:54:25 PM] Peter Peng: Oh I was referring to Gary
[3/12/23, 2:54:27 PM] Peter Peng: Haha
[3/12/23, 2:55:17 PM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[3/12/23, 2:55:30 PM] Peter Peng: Forget I asked lol
[3/12/23, 3:01:14 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 3:04:00 PM] Gary Teh: The piece of 1 acre land in the desert we will acquire once I get back to the US will be our headquarters

In the spirit of Burning Man of radical self reliance, If you plan to visit you got to bring your own water and food supplies.
[3/12/23, 3:11:25 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:13:15 PM] Peter Peng: So you will acquire that land using existing DAO funds or your own?
[3/12/23, 3:13:39 PM] Peter Peng: Just trying to understand
[3/12/23, 3:15:32 PM] Gary Teh: I will acquire the land with my own funds and then transfer ownership to the DAO.
[3/12/23, 3:15:49 PM] Gary Teh: In exchange for governance tokens
[3/12/23, 3:17:52 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 3:18:21 PM] Gary Teh: That is how we have always been doing it within this DAO.

Whatever the DAO needs OffChain, members will acquire it on behalf of our DAO using their own funds in exchange for governance tokens in it. 

So though there are no significant amount of funds within our DAO, the funds are alway sitting outside waiting to be deployed by DAO members when there are legitimate use for it
‎[3/12/23, 3:20:35 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 3:27:13 PM] Gary Teh: It’s the same as how @16468233438  deployed USD250 last month to cover the franchise renewal fee for the legal wrapper we have use for in the US jurisdiction 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20230209%20-%20Val%20delaware%20renewal.pdf

Fiat Capital is always being raised for needs with our DAO these are however not considered DAO revenue. 

These fall under DAO expenses covered by DAO members in exchange for governance tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:20 PM] Peter Peng: Understandable, how many tokens were awarded to Ken for the drinks? What is the exchange rate?
[3/12/23, 3:29:32 PM] Gary Teh: 40TDG tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:47 PM] Peter Peng: So $1 per token
[3/12/23, 3:29:50 PM] Gary Teh: Val was awarded 250TDg tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:53 PM] Gary Teh: Yes
[3/12/23, 3:30:18 PM] Peter Peng: Okay so when you create the liquidity pool they can then cash out if they choose?
[3/12/23, 3:30:23 PM] Gary Teh: And when I transfer the land I acquire using my own funds to the DAO. 

Assuming it costed me USD1000. I will be awarded 1000TDG tokens
[3/12/23, 3:30:33 PM] Gary Teh: True
[3/12/23, 3:31:10 PM] Gary Teh: However the exchange rate with be at USD0.003 per TDG token
[3/12/23, 3:31:18 PM] Peter Peng: How many tokens are minted?
[3/12/23, 3:31:59 PM] Gary Teh: 1 billion 

Except those already issued out the rest of them are right now sitting in our vault

https://TrueSight.me/vault
[3/12/23, 3:32:15 PM] Peter Peng: So it’s better to wait and squire TDG tokens at $0.003 USD
[3/12/23, 3:32:20 PM] Peter Peng: Acquire
[3/12/23, 3:32:42 PM] Gary Teh: Token holders need to approve before more tokens can be released from the vault
[3/12/23, 3:32:49 PM] Gary Teh: Up to you 🙂
[3/12/23, 3:32:51 PM] Peter Peng: How many have been issued out in total?
[3/12/23, 3:32:59 PM] Gary Teh: 1.5 million
[3/12/23, 3:33:13 PM] Gary Teh: Check the ledger if you need the exact number
[3/12/23, 3:33:23 PM] Gary Teh: Https://TrueSight.me/ledger
[3/12/23, 3:33:25 PM] Peter Peng: So how will you be able to cover the liquidity needed?
[3/12/23, 3:33:45 PM] Peter Peng: Based on the amount you have issued out?
[3/12/23, 3:33:52 PM] Gary Teh: USd5000 / 1.5 million tokens
[3/12/23, 3:34:12 PM] Gary Teh: The is the exchange rate if you want to cash out now

You get technically get penalized
[3/12/23, 3:34:12 PM] Peter Peng: Okay, so the $5k is already spent
[3/12/23, 3:34:32 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. USD5K is what we plan to pump into the liquidity pool
[3/12/23, 3:34:52 PM] Peter Peng: Right but the’ve already been allocated out
[3/12/23, 3:35:11 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO can vote to split it otherwise
[3/12/23, 3:35:31 PM] Gary Teh: The dao can vote on how the USD5000 should be deployed
[3/12/23, 3:35:33 PM] Peter Peng: Interesting
[3/12/23, 3:35:50 PM] Peter Peng: But I thought it has already been allocated out
[3/12/23, 3:36:13 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. It’s up to the DAO to decide that is what I have stated earlier
[3/12/23, 3:36:19 PM] Peter Peng: Shouldn’t Ken get more than 40 TDG if the exchange rate is $0.003
[3/12/23, 3:36:32 PM] Peter Peng: Okay I’m losing you
[3/12/23, 3:36:59 PM] Peter Peng: If he gave you $40
[3/12/23, 3:37:20 PM] Gary Teh: Nope

You contribute to the DaO on the assumption that each token is worth USD1

If you want to cash out early, you get penalized with the USD0.003 exchange rate
[3/12/23, 3:37:43 PM] Gary Teh: That is how we align the interest of members and the DAO
[3/12/23, 3:37:46 PM] Peter Peng: So basically no incentive
[3/12/23, 3:38:01 PM] Peter Peng: Lol okay gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:38:04 PM] Gary Teh: No monetary incentive
[3/12/23, 3:38:28 PM] Peter Peng: I’m 100% clear now
[3/12/23, 3:38:47 PM] Gary Teh: Ask @14152032783 if he contributed USd40 for drinks because he cared about profit?

He cared about building a community 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 3:39:22 PM] Peter Peng: Right, but why issue him the 40 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:39:36 PM] Peter Peng: What was the point lol
[3/12/23, 3:39:46 PM] Gary Teh: Notarizing contribution dude
[3/12/23, 3:39:51 PM] Peter Peng: Just be like thanks Ken you are awesome!
[3/12/23, 3:40:08 PM] Gary Teh: That is not the way dude
[3/12/23, 3:40:30 PM] Peter Peng: I see
[3/12/23, 3:41:38 PM] Gary Teh: In case, some of the projects gain traction and start generating profits to push actual cash in vault per issued token over USD1, you want to make sure every single person who has contributed gets properly acknowledged remuneration wise
[3/12/23, 3:41:50 PM] Peter Peng: Sorry I was just looking at the investment potential
[3/12/23, 3:43:55 PM] Peter Peng: When are the token holders allowed to cash out?
[3/12/23, 3:44:22 PM] Peter Peng: As not to be penealized with the $0.003 = 1 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:44:49 PM] Peter Peng: But to have the equivalent $1 = 1 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:45:12 PM] Gary Teh: When the projects amhave successfully generated revenue in amount more than total amount of tokens issued
[3/12/23, 3:45:42 PM] Peter Peng: Which projects?
[3/12/23, 3:46:11 PM] Gary Teh: So if one of our projects end up generating net profit of USD2 million next month then we the exchange rate will be more than 1USD to 1TDG
[3/12/23, 3:46:32 PM] Peter Peng: like Edgar
[3/12/23, 3:47:03 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
‎[3/12/23, 3:47:15 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 3:47:34 PM] Gary Teh: More projects will be added and retired depending on DAO evolution
[3/12/23, 3:48:48 PM] Peter Peng: So your liquidity pool with launch with an exchange rate of $0.003?
[3/12/23, 3:49:26 PM] Gary Teh: To be more correct 

0.003333333333333
[3/12/23, 3:50:13 PM] Gary Teh: The exchange rate will go down as more effort is injected into the DAo and the projects don’t make progress 

It’s not very different from how startups work. 

Just think of it as very fluid down rounds
[3/12/23, 3:50:14 PM] Peter Peng: 1.5 million TDG is equal to $4,500 USD
[3/12/23, 3:50:41 PM] Gary Teh: Just divide USDt5000 by all tokens already issued
[3/12/23, 3:50:46 PM] Gary Teh: It’s a floating number
[3/12/23, 3:51:19 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:52:35 PM] Peter Peng: So better to purchase tokens once liquidity pool is launched
[3/12/23, 3:52:44 PM] Peter Peng: As not to get diluted
[3/12/23, 3:54:39 PM] Gary Teh: Well.. that is if existing token holders wants to cash out
[3/12/23, 3:55:37 PM] Peter Peng: I would imagine that’s the point 😏
[3/12/23, 3:56:25 PM] Gary Teh: I would be curious as well to observe who in fact cashes and then do a cross reference to their contribution on the ledger 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 3:59:10 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, because if you don’t have enough people buying tokens then it will be tough
[3/12/23, 3:59:45 PM] Peter Peng: Who put in the initial $5k?
[3/12/23, 4:01:41 PM] Gary Teh: That is automatically handled by the AMM
[3/12/23, 4:02:08 PM] Gary Teh: The Daoveral group which injected 32K worth of resources last year 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 4:02:32 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it’s like the Zappos experiment on chains
[3/12/23, 4:02:53 PM] Peter Peng: So you still have access to those funds?
[3/12/23, 4:03:09 PM] Peter Peng: Or you have to go through them
[3/12/23, 4:04:56 PM] Peter Peng: When you say “resources” that’s capital?
[3/12/23, 4:09:08 PM] Gary Teh: They have all been deployed already except the USd5000
[3/12/23, 4:09:19 PM] Gary Teh: In various forms
[3/12/23, 4:09:48 PM] Peter Peng: So the USD $5000 they still hold?
[3/12/23, 4:10:27 PM] Peter Peng: What is the amount in USD
[3/12/23, 4:10:59 PM] Peter Peng: How much cash? I’m not concerned with sweat equity
[3/12/23, 4:13:54 PM] Gary Teh: Check the vault end of next week and it will become clear 🙂
[3/12/23, 4:14:38 PM] Peter Peng: Unless there is $5k in the vault / or you control there technically is no liquidity pool
[3/12/23, 4:15:52 PM] Peter Peng: So yeah, you probably want to take care of that ASAP or tokens have no value
[3/12/23, 4:16:10 PM] Peter Peng: From an investment perspective
[3/12/23, 4:18:36 PM] Peter Peng: I’m glad you were honest about where the $5k is
[3/12/23, 4:18:54 PM] Peter Peng: Hopefully you can get that moved into the account
[3/12/23, 4:19:07 PM] Peter Peng: The vault
[3/12/23, 4:22:01 PM] Peter Peng: Let me know if you need help getting that $5k moved over
[3/12/23, 4:22:17 PM] Gary Teh: I have always been very open about

The location has always been documented on the ledger. 🤔

Also on our GitHub profile
[3/12/23, 4:22:39 PM] Gary Teh: https://github.com/truesightdao
[3/12/23, 4:23:18 PM] Gary Teh: I guess it’s either as @5491125130580 says information is all over the place or people don’t like reading documentation
[3/12/23, 4:23:22 PM] Gary Teh: 🤔🤷‍♂️
[3/12/23, 4:24:08 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why I needed clarity because I was under the assumption you had $5k USDT in your possession based on the way you weee speaking.
[3/12/23, 4:24:23 PM] Peter Peng: I didn’t want to assume you cash position
[3/12/23, 4:24:35 PM] Peter Peng: *were
[3/12/23, 4:24:49 PM] Gary Teh: It’s always been sitting into the vault on the TRC chain

We are just consolidating it into realms on the Solana chain now
[3/12/23, 4:25:25 PM] Brian -IOM: 1 TDG = 1 TDG 😎
[3/12/23, 4:26:07 PM] Peter Peng: Basically that’s where I ended up at
[3/12/23, 4:27:20 PM] Peter Peng: I was seeing if I could at least buy myself a cheeseburger 🍔
[3/12/23, 4:27:28 PM] Peter Peng: But not yet
[3/12/23, 4:37:11 PM] Gary Teh: Got to work hard dude. If projects make progress and generates revenue then we will soon be able to buy some burgers by exchanging our tokens 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 4:42:40 PM] Peter Peng: Lol I thought this was so nothing society 😝
[3/12/23, 4:43:35 PM] Peter Peng: *do nothing
[3/12/23, 4:54:36 PM] Gary Teh: That was the other chatroom dude. Dao members who want to chill just go hang out there
[3/12/23, 5:05:22 PM] Gary Teh: In case you need the link

[3/12/23, 6:09:50 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : I care about Gary ❤️

Growing and supporting our communities
[3/12/23, 6:46:58 PM] Peter Peng: I have no doubt, I’m just still trying to ponder the whole $1 USD = 1 TDG 😂. But hey, not everything needs to makes sense lol
[3/12/23, 6:48:28 PM] Peter Peng: Spending more time thinking about it makes even less sense.
[3/12/23, 10:24:31 PM] Gary Teh: For the longest time The fact that shares of a company is valued at way more than their book value did not make sense
[3/12/23, 10:24:48 PM] Gary Teh: I feel warmth knowing this brother 🙂🙏

[3/13/23, 4:57:36 AM] Gary Teh: 25% holdings on cryptocurrency
[3/13/23, 5:07:12 AM] Brian -IOM: Liquidity crunch. Interesting thing is that Binance is moving funds from BUSD to BTC and ETH. This is the moment of reckoning: do you want to assume the systemic risks associated with holding fiat in banks or being inside native crypto instead?!
[3/13/23, 5:08:22 AM] Brian -IOM: And isn’t this why we’re all here after all?!
[3/13/23, 5:27:29 AM] Gary Teh: And the people of Argentina stands with us

I would be really curious to see how actual situation on the ground is like when I pass through Brazil, Columbia, El Salvador and perhaps Venezuela 

A few of countries known to actively accept Bitcoin for purchases of goods and services
[3/13/23, 5:32:14 AM] Gary Teh: Venezuela will be particularly interesting, if I do get my visa. Their economy is almost entirely crippled thanks to ongoing U.S. sanctions

He works with his patients by providing the framework and his patients in collaboration with him define that version of the future that they desire and then at some point they make the mental leap and transition
[3/13/23, 11:12:06 AM] Peter Peng: Sure if it makes sense to whoever the more power to them
[3/13/23, 11:13:04 AM] Peter Peng: And it may very well make sense to Ken because you help him with Offchain

http://rebrand.ly/AISUMMIT

The premise of the contributions I am planning to make during the discussions will mainly revolve around the two paradoxes of AI. 

- Polyani’s Paradox
- Moravec’s Paradox

And stemming from them, speculations of what will and will not be impacted by the large scale deployment of AI models across our society

from an economic stand point, I would like to bring up for discussion the extreme deflationary and monopolistic effects of AI when layered on top our current automation platforms due to the kinds of winner takes all network effects dynamics often baked into current accompanying business models. 

One of my main concerns is that if not managed properly we will accidentally tip society from the liberal democracies we see around us into Feudalistic systems governed by the minority who will owns the AIs and automation platforms everyone is relying on
[3/14/23, 5:43:07 AM] Peter Peng: Haha classic movie

Will proceed to tokenize them on the ledger sometime this week. 🙂👍🏻
[3/14/23, 6:55:10 AM] Gary Teh: We have gained enough clarity for our landing pages initiative to move forward with the next steps. 🤩
[3/14/23, 6:55:36 AM] Peter Peng: Almost at a cheeseburger 🍔 😬

[3/14/23, 7:02:02 AM] Peter Peng: You need to get the $5k for liquidity pool, let me know if you need help
[3/14/23, 7:02:48 AM] Peter Peng: The crypto markets are going up so you should try and get on an exchange
[3/14/23, 7:03:26 AM] Peter Peng: Need help speaking with Daoversal
[3/14/23, 7:07:20 AM] Peter Peng: That’s just what I would do
[3/14/23, 7:07:28 AM] Peter Peng: But it’s your DAO
[3/14/23, 7:08:17 AM] Gary Teh: Trying to figure out where to get some TRX tokens now. the 5000USDT is sitting in this TRON wallet. 

https://tronscan.org/#/address/TCjSAxGbWWTw4wAoHsNhLn1acvjqK2mgR7

Need to send some TRX tokens to that wallet before I can go ahead with the transaction of sending the USDT5000 to my account in Gate.IO

Once that is done, cross chain the USDT5000 to the Solana chain and then transfer our vault on Realms
[3/14/23, 7:09:20 AM] Peter Peng: Sounds like a scam, why do you need to send money to that wallet?
[3/14/23, 7:10:00 AM] Peter Peng: I worked with the FBI on an advanced fee fraud case in Thailand and China
[3/14/23, 7:10:16 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe this is a crypto version?
[3/14/23, 7:10:34 AM] Peter Peng: Just be careful before sending any money
[3/14/23, 7:12:11 AM] Gary Teh: I control that wallet dude. You need to pay gas fee for transactions to happen
[3/14/23, 7:12:43 AM] Gary Teh: Its like it you try to perform transaction on your solana wallet and your wallet does not contain any SOL. No money to pay gas fee = no transaction
[3/14/23, 7:23:31 AM] Peter Peng: Oh
[3/14/23, 7:23:58 AM] Peter Peng: But I thought you had $5k on it?
[3/14/23, 7:26:15 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/14/23, 7:26:21 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/14/23, 7:27:56 AM] Peter Peng: $0.000005 whenever you make a transaction (tron)
[3/14/23, 7:29:35 AM] Gary Teh: The 5K is USDT. 
You need it in TRX on the wallet before you can use it to pay for gas fees.
To convert USDT to TRX, you still need TRX for gas fees. 

I am transferring some USDT from my personal coinbase account now to my Huobi account now via the Ethereum chain. 

Once the USDT goes through, I will exchange the USDT to TRX the Huobi exchange
Then I will transfer the TRX i bought on Huobi exchange to the Tron Wallet I am controlling

With that to pay for gas fees, I will transfer the 5000USDT to my personal Gate.IO account

Then from there I will do the cross chain to transfer the 5000USDT to our Realms vault on Solana

Welcome to the rabbit hole
[3/14/23, 7:30:35 AM] Gary Teh: Right now, I am waiting for the USD29 from Coinbase to Huobi to go through. The Ethereum is so slow.
[3/14/23, 7:31:41 AM] Peter Peng: It is what it is
[3/14/23, 7:32:41 AM] Gary Teh: Transaction being processed

[3/14/23, 7:33:06 AM] Gary Teh: This fee I am paying on behalf of the DAO will be notarized in exchange for TDG governance tokens
[3/14/23, 7:33:33 AM] Peter Peng: Or can come out of the $5k
‎[3/14/23, 7:34:24 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:34:27 AM] Peter Peng: So you don’t lose money on you $1 USD = 1 TDG conversion
[3/14/23, 7:35:25 AM] Peter Peng: Or issue yourself TDG at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:35:38 AM] Peter Peng: Which I believe is the real exchange rate
[3/14/23, 7:37:50 AM] Gary Teh: As mentioned. Nope. We all agree to contribute based on the assumption that 1TDG = 1USD.

Anyone that wants to cash out immediately once the liquidity pool is setup can do so but at the discounted rate of $0.00333
‎[3/14/23, 7:38:36 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:39:04 AM] Peter Peng: I think it will be tough for people to buy at $1
[3/14/23, 7:39:13 AM] Peter Peng: But that’s just me
[3/14/23, 7:39:15 AM] Gary Teh: They should not.
[3/14/23, 7:39:27 AM] Gary Teh: Its sweat equity.
[3/14/23, 7:39:32 AM] Peter Peng: What price will they be buying at?
[3/14/23, 7:39:45 AM] Peter Peng: Oh so the tokens aren’t for sale?
[3/14/23, 7:39:59 AM] Gary Teh: From what I forsee, the DAO will be buying back at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:40:12 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : Great Gary ⚡
[3/14/23, 7:41:10 AM] Gary Teh: Market determines the price. 

But DAO will for sure buy back from any willing sellers at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:41:11 AM] Peter Peng: You would need to define “early”
[3/14/23, 7:41:29 AM] Gary Teh: What do you mean by that?
[3/14/23, 7:41:30 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe that’s the unclear part
[3/14/23, 7:41:40 AM] Peter Peng: What cashing out early means
[3/14/23, 7:41:48 AM] Peter Peng: What the date is
[3/14/23, 7:43:05 AM] Gary Teh: I see what you mean. 
Early means you want to cash out before there is more USDT in the vault than TDG issued out.
[3/14/23, 7:43:21 AM] Gary Teh: The exact timing depends on the execution of various projects
[3/14/23, 7:43:41 AM] Peter Peng: Hmmm that will be tough
[3/14/23, 7:44:10 AM] Gary Teh: That is why I saw being involved in this DAO is not for everybody.
‎[3/14/23, 7:44:25 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:44:29 AM] Gary Teh: Buying some TRX tokens now
[3/14/23, 7:44:34 AM] Peter Peng: Tough for investors
[3/14/23, 7:45:13 AM] Peter Peng: Since you’ve issued out 1.5 million TDG already for the $5k
[3/14/23, 7:45:26 AM] Peter Peng: You need to sell tokens
[3/14/23, 7:45:53 AM] Peter Peng: Or else it just looks like a “slave labor” model for the DAO
[3/14/23, 7:46:22 AM] Peter Peng: This is just an outside perspective
[3/14/23, 7:46:33 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure how sustainable it is
[3/14/23, 7:46:36 AM] Gary Teh: The 1.5 miillion TDG was not issued out for the $5K 
It was for all the efforts that have already been sunk into the ecosystem so far
[3/14/23, 7:47:23 AM] Peter Peng: Right, but if everyone was to cash out all at once the value of the DAO would drop significantly
[3/14/23, 7:47:33 AM] Peter Peng: Even at the $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:47:46 AM] Peter Peng: Penalty
‎[3/14/23, 7:47:49 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:48:35 AM] Peter Peng: You see what I’m saying? Your 1 TDG = $1 USD would become depegged
[3/14/23, 7:49:58 AM] Brian -IOM: Peter I told you already: 1TDG = 1TDG 😂🙌
[3/14/23, 7:50:37 AM] Peter Peng: I keep forgetting 😅 …
[3/14/23, 7:51:34 AM] Peter Peng: Just trying to help lol
‎[3/14/23, 7:56:32 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:58:45 AM] Peter Peng: So 1 TDG = $0.003 USD right?
[3/14/23, 7:58:49 AM] Gary Teh: I totally get your point of view. 

So long as there continues to be insane people like me willing to continue contributing to the DAO by valuing each 1TDG at 1USD, the dynamic will still continue to hold

Folks that have lost faith and want nothing to do with the whole insanity can just cash out their outstanding TDG holdings at the prevailing $0.00333, while the rest of insane horde can continue. 🤣
[3/14/23, 7:59:14 AM] Peter Peng: So 1 TDG = 1 TDG = $0.003 USD right?
[3/14/23, 8:00:02 AM] Brian -IOM: I don't have a dog - or indeed a Doge - in this fight. I'm just along for the ride! 🐶
[3/14/23, 8:00:21 AM] Peter Peng: Lol so you are saying you want $1 billion worth of sweat equity?
[3/14/23, 8:00:59 AM] Peter Peng: Before the price of the coin goes up
[3/14/23, 8:01:18 AM] Peter Peng: Not sustainable
[3/14/23, 8:01:57 AM] Peter Peng: You are not some god-king 😂
[3/14/23, 8:02:06 AM] Peter Peng: Building pyramids here
[3/14/23, 8:02:40 AM] Peter Peng: I’m the Camry
[3/14/23, 8:02:44 AM] Peter Peng: In
[3/14/23, 8:03:29 AM] Peter Peng: Makes for good entertainment though

[3/14/23, 8:05:45 AM] Peter Peng: Or whole thing?
[3/14/23, 8:06:02 AM] Peter Peng: I think you should keep half for your expenses
[3/14/23, 8:06:54 AM] Peter Peng: Put the other half in liquidity pool selling tokens at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 8:07:13 AM] Peter Peng: And live to fight another day

[3/14/23, 8:13:12 AM] Peter Peng: That’s how I think a sustainable business is.
[3/14/23, 8:13:29 AM] Peter Peng: Then hire employees
[3/14/23, 8:15:46 AM] Peter Peng: You need a sustainable business model
[3/14/23, 8:16:19 AM] Peter Peng: In order for people to invest

[3/14/23, 8:18:43 AM] Gary Teh: Dude, bulk of the server costs are all being paid for by Jake right now in exchange for governance tokens.
[3/14/23, 8:19:44 AM] Peter Peng: At the 1 TDG = $1 exchange rate?
[3/14/23, 8:20:06 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. 1TDG to 1USD

[3/14/23, 8:21:18 AM] Peter Peng: Lol yeah but at some point you’ll want to grow
[3/14/23, 8:21:25 AM] Gary Teh: That is why you never have any wall street people successfully starting multi billion dollar companies.
[3/14/23, 8:22:32 AM] Peter Peng: You are over valuing the Token
[3/14/23, 8:22:40 AM] Gary Teh: You need the crazy one to do that. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-CfNrpuhI
[3/14/23, 8:23:03 AM] Peter Peng: You are saying that TrueSight DAO is a $1 billion dollar company today off of sweat equity
[3/14/23, 8:23:08 AM] Peter Peng: Insane
[3/14/23, 8:23:19 AM] Gary Teh: So be it. As @6598383264 always says, to be pioneer to live and die by your decisions. 🤣
[3/14/23, 8:23:47 AM] Peter Peng: Hahaha
[3/14/23, 8:23:48 AM] Gary Teh: Today, it is worth 1.5million USD
[3/14/23, 8:24:09 AM] Peter Peng: You have 1 billion TDG
[3/14/23, 8:24:24 AM] Peter Peng: You’ve only issued 1.5 million
[3/14/23, 8:25:02 AM] Peter Peng: So you are total valuing the company 1 billion… do you see my perspective?
[3/14/23, 8:25:50 AM] Gary Teh: Hmmmm... Not sure if you have realized by now.  You are talking to a generally insane person.

Someone who bought a one way ticket into ground zero Rome during the pandemic to verify that pandemic is actually happening.

And who actually got thrown into jail in China for investigating the Uighur oppression issue 

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/ 🤣
[3/14/23, 8:26:45 AM] Peter Peng: Lol okay but still doesn’t make for a good investment
[3/14/23, 8:27:05 AM] Gary Teh: Doesn't matter. We don't need your cash.
[3/14/23, 8:27:08 AM] Gary Teh: 🤣
[3/14/23, 8:28:30 AM] Peter Peng: Haha good because I’d have a hard time getting it back
[3/14/23, 8:28:43 AM] Peter Peng: 😂

[3/14/23, 8:34:32 AM] Gary Teh: I suddenly recall something that @5511982667030 mentioned last year during one of our meetings 

Go all in, if a project is meant to fail fail thoroughly, make sure there are no stones left turned so that there are no regrets later on. 🤣
‎[3/14/23, 8:36:51 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 8:38:02 AM] Gary Teh: One important thing that came out from this mornings meeting with @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @381644913030 is that future governance token grants to finance projects in our DAO from our vault will have a formal approval process. 

Exact details are being right now worked out
[3/14/23, 8:38:59 AM] Gary Teh: Each project will be tied to specific KPIs 

at the project levels, formal roles with well defined tasks and governance token renumeration will be defined.
[3/14/23, 8:44:01 AM] Peter Peng: So you will be using the $5k to fund projects?
[3/14/23, 8:44:55 AM] Gary Teh: 🤷‍♂️

The DAO decides through voting
[3/14/23, 8:46:34 AM] Peter Peng: I would propose using that capital to find projects / cryptocurrency to invest in
[3/14/23, 8:47:11 AM] Peter Peng: Even putting it into BTC right now
[3/14/23, 8:48:00 AM] Peter Peng: as long as you have liquidity
[3/14/23, 8:48:39 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to submit a proposal for voting 🙂👍🏻

[3/14/23, 8:48:52 AM] Gary Teh: The proposal submission and voting features of Realms is quite nicely done.
[3/14/23, 8:49:51 AM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 this is my discord ID, looking forward to getting introduced to the founder you mentioned 
garyjob#4037
[3/14/23, 8:58:20 AM] Gary Teh: @14152032783 I have created a new document to draft up the gist of the talk I gave on Friday which you wanted included in the upcoming OffChain newsletter

The link can be found here.

[3/14/23, 10:28:01 AM] Gary Teh: Insightful video on the stress that’s been going on since last Wednesday in Silicon Valley 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasoncalacanis_founders-bankrun-siliconvalleybank-activity-7041428747727626240-3DoU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios
[3/14/23, 10:38:24 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that came out crystal clear during this morning's discussion is that the attention span of members are limited. 

Rather than sharing this limited attention of our community on projects that nothing at all to do with the furthering of our governance token's utility and value, we will opt instead to focus attention bandwidth to projects that have direct associations with our governance tokens.
[3/14/23, 10:41:07 AM] Gary Teh: Folks who want to continue sharing their projects can feel free to do so in the Do Nothing society.
[3/14/23, 10:41:31 AM] Gary Teh: https://truesight.me/do-nothing
[3/14/23, 10:43:05 AM] Peter Peng: Nothingness further validates my claim that each TDG token is only worth $0.00333 at the moment
[3/14/23, 10:43:41 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
‎[3/14/23, 10:46:53 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 10:50:53 AM] Gary Teh: Yes!

It is definitely going to be worth even less next month when valued based on the cash to token issued ratio when taking into account the expected volume of token issues in exchange for member contributions. 🤩

If I were you, I would probably cash out immediately as soon as the liquidity pool is setup and then have nothing more to do with this insane group of people 🤣
[3/14/23, 10:55:44 AM] Peter Peng: I would need to cash out at the $1
[3/14/23, 10:56:01 AM] Peter Peng: Valuation
[3/14/23, 10:56:22 AM] Peter Peng: Which you raise sweat equity on
[3/14/23, 10:56:38 AM] Peter Peng: Why cash out at a loss?
[3/14/23, 10:57:25 AM] Peter Peng: When does that happen?
[3/14/23, 11:01:23 AM] Gary Teh: No idea dude. Might happen faster if you pour more sweat equity into the projects 🤣
[3/14/23, 11:08:47 AM] Peter Peng: Or be awarded more tokens to equate for the difference
[3/14/23, 11:09:35 AM] Gary Teh: That would be against our rubric 🙂
[3/14/23, 11:09:43 AM] Peter Peng: (In actuality I don’t care about the money or tokens) this is just the money game to me
[3/14/23, 11:09:59 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[3/14/23, 11:10:22 AM] Peter Peng: Think of it as sparring practice
[3/14/23, 11:11:01 AM] Peter Peng: For real investors
[3/14/23, 11:11:41 AM] Gary Teh: Actually these are good points you raised 🙂👍

And will definitely be helpful as we draft up the onboarding documents that @918017107841 @5491125130580 and myself are right now focused on
[3/14/23, 11:12:00 AM] Peter Peng: I just want to see you succeed
[3/14/23, 11:12:48 AM] Peter Peng: Plus I might want to buy some coins
[3/14/23, 11:13:09 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t care about the tokens earned via sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:13:13 AM] Gary Teh: I am glad you are with us on our journey 🤩
[3/14/23, 11:13:54 AM] Gary Teh: Should be coming soon

Once the market gets listed on Dexlab

Haven’t heard anything from them still 

Will follow up sometime this week or next
[3/14/23, 11:14:34 AM] Peter Peng: Just consider the how you price the tokens
[3/14/23, 11:15:18 AM] Peter Peng: Better to give more tokens for the sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:15:39 AM] Peter Peng: So the investors want to invest
[3/14/23, 11:16:43 AM] Peter Peng: You have 1 billion
[3/14/23, 11:17:20 AM] Peter Peng: Who care if you allocate all 1 billion, the price of the token will rise for all
[3/14/23, 11:17:51 AM] Peter Peng: More people will want to provide the sweat equity lol
[3/14/23, 11:27:31 AM] Peter Peng: Let’s just say this, you are more likely to raise $1 billion cash than to raise $1 billion in sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:42:47 AM] Gary Teh: Actually after reading through the Raydium protocol what might be interesting is for people to earn TDG governance tokens for staking their LP tokens (tokens you get from Raydium after staking USDT/TDG pairs in the liquidity pool)

That serves to lock up liquidity and renumerate liquidity providers in the ecosystem
[3/14/23, 12:15:44 PM] Peter Peng: Yes which is why it needs one price and conversion rate
[3/14/23, 12:16:32 PM] Peter Peng: At some point the sweat equity stops
[3/14/23, 12:17:28 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding future revenues earned from successful projects within our DAO, @381644913030 has suggested that 10-25% of the revenue to channeled into the liquidity pools to back the value of the tokens

I think we should even a step further by burning the LP tokens issued. That way the liquidity generated via those sources gets forever locked into the pool
[3/14/23, 12:18:56 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure I agree just yet with the second paragraph… need to think on it
[3/14/23, 12:19:53 PM] Juan Bernabó: That is the end goal?
[3/14/23, 12:19:59 PM] Juan Bernabó: What?
[3/14/23, 12:21:35 PM] Gary Teh: A self balancing, self perpetuating and self governing ecosystem that builds a better world based on verified truth 

One that adheres to the values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity 

The vision in the form of an ecosystem of projects
[3/14/23, 12:21:42 PM] Gary Teh: That is TrueSight DAO
[3/14/23, 12:22:35 PM] Peter Peng: Burning tokens just increases the value
[3/14/23, 12:24:57 PM] Juan Bernabó: Each other is a business that generates profit in fiat or just in crypto?

[3/14/23, 12:38:35 PM] Juan Bernabó: Our vision of ♾️labs has to do with catalizing the transformation to the ♾️economy by catalizing and developing ecosystemic businesses that can turn disruption waves and big challenges into huge business opportunities for networks of thousands of smb and millions of people, also have this ideia of a self perpetuating and self governing ecosystem but not at the beginning as the visioning, boostraping and structuring I don't really know how to make that happens with a distributed organization, a lot of DAOs start centralized for that reason and after they have the core running they open up for the community and shift the governance to them... It's a great research subject to understand, boostraping DAOs...
[3/14/23, 12:42:13 PM] Gary Teh: And that is part of the RnD we are doing within this ecosystem

[3/14/23, 2:11:57 PM] Gary Teh: I believe it is possible to create a world where we could make good decisions using information that had been verified to be true 

And there are various kinds of good important decisions we need to make. 

Thus the need for various projects to tackle these various kinds of decision

And when we have done what we have set out to do we would have built a better world based on verifiable truth

And in the process we would have setup the proper foundation to safeguard the autonomy of individuals, through systems with integrity to preserve our diverse ecosystem
[3/14/23, 2:15:46 PM] Gary Teh: Personally for me, I know my daughter is going to grow up to become a very strong headed person. 

So better work hard to setup the foundation to safeguard our autonomy in that future world so that she does not need to expend so much effort to do so when the time comes for her to take the helm in the future. 

And when the time finally comes for me to pass over to the next incarnation I will be able to Rest In Peace knowing I have done everything I could during this incarnation 🙏

[3/14/23, 10:06:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: i just caught up with what @14153000019 and @14075792560 was discussing about token valuation. 

Actually early on last year 2022 around Apr May? I made the very same observation as @14075792560. So we do think alike in certain ways. As I made the same observation. I agree with what Peter said 100%

@14153000019 bro I have tried to explain to you when you approach investors, the very first obstacle you will receive is. “Why is there already 1.5M TDG issued” “why should I pay x amount for only x TDG.” 

I said also as an investor I will examine your rubic and view it as a constant dilution source. And if x number of years created x amount of TDG. How much revenue has been created? From there I will understand the capital management of the Dao and see if it’s a good or bad company. 

Your rubic needs a serious rework. I have objected to and will continue to object to useless dilutions such as giving out tokens for simple comments like this one I am making. 

Although in the rubic I am making critical governance input. Hence tokens must be credited to me now. 

However I do acknowledge that Dao members need to be credited for any contributions, thought and comment and time spent to say or do anything for the Dao. 

As a result, you got to manage the token issue amounts with careful result oriented balancing. (Sort of game balancing mechanics that results in fair play)

The second option is make money faster than your issue rate in order to appeal to investors. 

Otherwise whatever @14075792560 and my grilling on the token issues will be the tip of the iceberg compared to what investors have to ask.
[3/14/23, 10:19:06 PM] Gary Teh: Good point. 
Nascent business models all very high failures. We have so far tested and slaughtered around 5 business models which we know to have failed. 

As the amount of business models tested fails, the amount of dilution will naturally increase. 

This is true not just for DAOs. It is exactly the same phenomena observed in traditional tech startups. The exception is dilution is more apparent in DAOs as compared to traditional startups where effects of dilution is often opaque and visible only to board members. 

Rubric wise, as I have also suggested before feel free to propose line item changes 

All DAO members have the right to do so. 

Also all DAO members have the right to vote on token issues. 

The burden does not just lie on the shoulder of one member. It just so happens that one member is more active in notarizing contributions 🙂

My hunch is the KPI based token issues method that @381644913030 @918017107841 and @5491125130580 suggested might help address the concern you raise about dilution
[3/14/23, 10:22:53 PM] Gary Teh: ultimately it just boils down to project success rates.
[3/14/23, 10:29:45 PM] Gary Teh: Investors will naturally be willing to pay a premium to buy into projects with a strong performance metrics

So far, none of our projects are really hitting those performance levels. 

If we can find use case that is so critical and user adoption growth rate is 100% month over month, then you don’t even need to bother pitching for investments, partners from Andressen Horowitz will just come knocking of their own accord
[3/14/23, 10:53:33 PM] Gary Teh: another approach I can think of to deal with the dilution issue is to use the same approach VC funds use

50% each round of fund typically gets deployed across 10 startups. With the remaining 50% deployed in follow on rounds of these initial startups if they are successfully hitting their numbers 

We have already tested and killed 5 business models so far. We cap it a maximum testing of another 5 business models. 

If even those 5 new ones fail, we will stop issuing more tokens from our vault for contribution efforts by members. This essential pulls the kill switch on the DAO. 🤔
[3/14/23, 11:37:55 PM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/15/23, 12:16:27 AM] Peter Peng: Why not invest the funds in projects that already have a token? Makes it easier to have liquidity, even if the project ultimately fails there are ways to make money (if you get in early enough) or if you time the investment correctly. The projects underneath the DAO don’t have tokens currently or plan on having a token sale.
[3/15/23, 12:17:06 AM] Peter Peng: The beauty of Web3 is that there is usually liquidity early.
[3/15/23, 12:17:41 AM] Peter Peng: This way you’ll always have funds to invest if your returns are good.
[3/15/23, 12:24:45 AM] Peter Peng: You could always use a percentage of the profits to invest in projects that do social good.
[3/15/23, 4:47:48 AM] Gary Teh: Having a token doesn’t mean it has a viable underlying business model
[3/15/23, 4:47:58 AM] Gary Teh: Those are two separate things

Cypher Defense, personally I am bearish on this after seeing the statistics

[3/15/23, 6:31:28 AM] Tres Garcia: 👆Some gold in here….. 
The project boils down to 2x questions. 
1. Where did the DAO come from? This is key to getting people excited about the platform and addresses Kelvin’s investor concerns. 
2. Where is the DAO going? 

Both should answer “Why” and allow the vision to take hold for builders, investors and users.
[3/15/23, 6:32:10 AM] Peter Peng: To date, most crypto VCs invest in crypto / web3 projects this way the funds stay “OnChain”
[3/15/23, 6:32:31 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I asked
[3/15/23, 6:32:44 AM] Gary Teh: A lot of projects, I just simply ignored and don't bother to follow up are either those which comes with no business models or the founders been just really avoidant when it comes to providing performance statistics. Those to me are immediate red flags however smooth talking the person doing the pitching is.
[3/15/23, 6:33:15 AM] Garis Pang: Deutsche Bank will join in the party soon 🥳
[3/15/23, 6:34:33 AM] Gary Teh: One of the projects, I came across at the Binance event in Frankfurt was so well packaged but when you started analyzing its tokenomics, you start realizing it is going to fail. And when it does, it is going to collapse really really fast. One of their executive members just reached out recently again hoping for investor introductions.

I didn't even bother to follow up.
[3/15/23, 6:34:34 AM] Tres Garcia: Readers change Moody’s observations from “Insightful” to “No-s#*t! Sherlock!”
[3/15/23, 6:35:26 AM] Tres Garcia: Good one
[3/15/23, 6:37:06 AM] Gary Teh: Other times, the yield of the projects clearly does not meet the return requirements of investor profiles in the network. So those I don't even bother to forward over. 

Angels are less strict in their ROI needs compared to VCs which have a tougher requirement because of their LP expectations.

[3/17/23, 7:01:07 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, but I like natural jokes haha 😂… I see the paid system being awkward
[3/17/23, 7:01:46 AM] Alessandro Mele: Fair enough! 😉
[3/17/23, 7:03:24 AM] Peter Peng: Gary and Tomas should get rewarded the most tokens for this hilarious system they are trying to put together 😂😂😂
[3/17/23, 7:06:46 AM] Peter Peng: Laugh-to-earn
[3/17/23, 7:07:01 AM] Peter Peng: Not everything needs to be tokenized

[3/17/23, 7:08:09 AM] Peter Peng: (300 TDG for each of you)

[3/17/23, 7:20:37 AM] Peter Peng: I think you and I have made about 900 TDG so far
[3/17/23, 7:21:49 AM] Peter Peng: With an exchange rate of 1 TDG = $1 USD according to Gary’s sweat equity conversion
[3/17/23, 7:22:52 AM] Peter Peng: This system just keeps getting more equitable
[3/17/23, 7:22:57 AM] Peter Peng: 😂

[3/17/23, 7:23:34 AM] Alessandro Mele: Well wait until we get kicked out 🤣🤣
[3/17/23, 7:30:49 AM] Peter Peng: Tokens issued on excel spreadsheet
[3/17/23, 7:30:57 AM] Peter Peng: I’m screwed!

[3/19/23, 12:34:37 PM] Iwona Fluda: Just a tiny breaking news from the mountainous financial empire called Switzerland: UBS Group has agreed to purchase the ailing Switzerland-based bank Credit Suisse for $2 billion.
[3/19/23, 12:35:34 PM] Iwona Fluda: All right, what`s the process behind it? 😁
‎[3/19/23, 2:32:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/19/23, 2:33:22 PM] Gary Teh: That is quite cheap. USD2billion??
[3/19/23, 2:35:11 PM] Iwona Fluda: Yes, it's nothing. Credit Suisse had apparently Total assets: 531.4 billion CHF (2022). 😂
[3/19/23, 2:36:47 PM] Gary Teh: That is awkward. So basically it’s a government engineered merger

USD531 billion sold for around USD2 billion?

What happens to the shareholders of credit suisse?
[3/19/23, 2:39:26 PM] Iwona Fluda: Most of the people would probably get laid off unfortunately. The rest is in the governmental hands. I see the headlines tomorrow morning saying how much the CH government is discussing to give to them.

[3/19/23, 2:42:00 PM] Iwona Fluda: Well, depending on the source, the number may vary. Nevertheless, 2 or almost 4 billion seems to be nothing.

[3/20/23, 2:13:16 PM] Gary Teh: You know the funny thing is quite a few of the banks that were involved in the meltdown somehow had significant exposure to cryptocurrency 

The fact that they are experiencing a meltdown while Bitcoin trends upwards feels like an oxymoron 

This is pretty much like how SVB collapse triggered the rebound of bond prices which was what triggered its bank run 🤔
[3/20/23, 2:14:41 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure as use of libraries like stable diffusion proliferates we will be expecting the proliferation of more and more of deepfake videos across the web
[3/20/23, 2:16:30 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the discussion we had last week between @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @381644913030 involved the setting up of oracles for prices from agricultural producers worldwide 

We will be having a follow up session tomorrow to further discuss this

For folks who are keen please to reach out to @918017107841 to get an invite to our online FaceTime session 🙂👍
[3/20/23, 2:17:41 PM] Aléksa: I will come with the first governance framework by end of the week

then would be great you review, give feedback, and we could also have a follow up call
[3/20/23, 2:18:25 PM] Gary Teh: Yes, that would be wonderful.  Thanks for doing so @381644913030 🙂🙏
[3/20/23, 2:23:49 PM] Gary Teh: Following up with Charmverse to checkout their solution 

I was wondering if anyone would be keen to craft up a video on how to use the proposal submission and voting features for Realms Solana?

I believe it would be great content to both share in this channel in exchange for governance tokens as well as share on your own LinkedIn feed to educate your followers who are keen to onboard into web3

I would happy to reshare the URL to your LinkedIn feed to the house of balance group too. There are increasing interest in that community for start adopting web3 solutions 🙂🙏
[3/20/23, 2:33:27 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/20/23, 2:33:55 PM] Gary Teh: DexLabs has not reverted with the listing of our USDT/TDG market listing on their DEX

I have a whole bunch of stuff on my plate to be able to follow up on that for the next few weeks. 

If someone is keen to follow up on that in exchange for governance tokens that would be great. 

Once our USDT/TDG market is listed on the DexLabs DEX we can start voting on how many percent of our USDT reserves we should utilize for buy backs from members looking to exit some of their holdings 🙂🙏
[3/20/23, 2:40:04 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/20/23, 2:40:55 PM] Gary Teh: Will spend sometime next week to look through the subscription revenue that Edgar generated over the past year when we trialed run doing direct sales of our market sell off reports before that direct sales initiative got aborted at the suggestion of @16468233438 when he proposed to replace it with a more scalable way of generating sales. 

Unfortunately that latter approach suggested by him failed with 0% conversion rate. 🤔

My hunch is the total amount of USDT in reserves should get bumped up by another USDT1000+. Will keep you all posted on the progress of that audit 🙂👍

Off the top of my head I recall we probably still have a few active subscribers for that service
[3/20/23, 2:44:03 PM] Gary Teh: So based on the rough math, the cash to issued token ratio should be approximately USD0.004 right now 

That is an appreciate bump of 20% over the past week 🤣
[3/20/23, 3:00:13 PM] Gary Teh: One thing has also became very clear during the discussions we have been having over the past few weeks. 

DAO member status is only had if an individual is in possession of our governance tokens because of prior contributions 

Being active in our chatroom discussions does not confer that status, it only makes an individual an observer of our DAO if his/her governance token holdings are Zero 🙂
[3/20/23, 8:05:33 PM] Gary Teh: Statements made in our chatrooms by various participants in no way represent the stance of the entire DAO.

The stance of the DAO is made apparent through its voting activities 

and for the formal voting process we are using the realms solution 

https://TrueSight.me/vault

The less formal route is via the polling feature of WhatsApp

[3/21/23, 5:28:02 AM] Gary Teh: Based on that projects like Cypher defense should theoretically be very important to have. 

Rather awkward that it doesn’t have any traction 🤔
[3/21/23, 5:36:50 AM] Brian -IOM: Perhaps ahead of the curve - just wait and do nothing!
[3/21/23, 5:43:44 AM] Gary Teh: True. Based on historical track record, I would even say we should expect to be doing nothing for around two years and then suddenly this use case becomes urgent 🤣
[3/21/23, 7:20:12 AM] Gary Teh: When I was trying to setup my technology consulting firm back in Singapore, 2 years of nothing before clients started pouring in

When I was trying to get into the events/publicity industry, 3 years of nothing before gigs started pouring in

When I started messing around with jazz, 2 years later it became mainstream

When I started building GetData.IO, 5 years before the passive income revenue stream started coming alive

When I started experimenting with the vertical farmings in urban setting, 2 years later it became a primary initiative in Singapore

When I started experimenting with DAOs, a year later it became a thing. 

When I moved from Singapore to Silicon Valley, 2 years later flow of talent in this direction became the norm

When I decided to move into my car during the pandemic, 1 year later the off the grid trend became mainstream.

These are the data points I have gathered so far

there will be a follow up session for Ecoverse21 in two weeks.

Meanwhile the new governors will be having a planning session in the forthcoming week

[3/21/23, 5:26:17 PM] Gary Teh: This is the start of the category of problem I have just described 

Now there is really no way of knowing the truth about anything anymore unless you actually go to the place yourself to investigate it
[3/21/23, 5:26:53 PM] Gary Teh: However since most of the population have neither the resources nor the time to do so, doesn’t figuratively throw us back into the dark ages??
[3/21/23, 5:28:01 PM] Brian -IOM: Totally - although I think that’s been the case for a while in terms of living in a reality distortion field. At least since covid - but probably significantly longer.
[3/21/23, 5:28:28 PM] Brian -IOM: Now it is unavoidably self evident!
[3/21/23, 5:29:01 PM] Gary Teh: Even right now, what I am observing being reported about trump seems to be a smearing campaign on the level that Richard Nixon experienced during the phase before he was trying to get elected to become president
[3/21/23, 5:30:36 PM] Brian -IOM: You have a short memory - he was relentlessly smeared before he was even inaugurated. What about the dossier paid for by HRC?
[3/21/23, 5:31:02 PM] Brian -IOM: Everything is fake and has been for ages - we just woke up to it!
[3/21/23, 5:51:27 PM] Tres Garcia: That’s how you know it’s fake news!
[3/21/23, 6:04:35 PM] Brian -IOM: For real! 😂
[3/21/23, 6:09:23 PM] Peter Peng: My question is… isn’t he supposed to be arrested in real life today?
[3/21/23, 6:11:21 PM] Gary Teh: Good question 

The charges is stupid. Being charged Hush money for a porn star to not talk about their affair during his campaigning season. 🤔

It feels more like something for the gossip column of the tabloids than something to be treated seriously. For example accepting bribes from Russia 🤦‍♂️
[3/21/23, 6:12:29 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t think anyone takes the government seriously anymore lol
[3/21/23, 6:14:19 PM] Dan: Metaverse today, irl tomorrow
[3/21/23, 6:14:33 PM] Gary Teh: Managed to gain more insight this evening by the pool on the inflation issue in Argentina 

It’s mainly the problem of having a communist inclined government in place that has no economic sense 🤔
[3/21/23, 6:16:57 PM] Brian -IOM: I guess that means that within 90 days the USA is, erm… a communist government that has no economic sense. 😛
[3/21/23, 6:19:44 PM] Gary Teh: How come??
[3/21/23, 6:21:36 PM] Brian -IOM: I believe the term is hyperbitcoinisation 😉
[3/21/23, 6:23:14 PM] Fatima: Be careful with the word “communist”… The actual party in power in Argentina is left wing, not communist.

You will see what is a communist party in Venezuela 🇻🇪
[3/21/23, 6:36:36 PM] Peter Peng: The US government created Bitcoin
[3/21/23, 6:37:04 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! 🤩👍

Will be fascinating to see how their entire system works when I am there
[3/21/23, 10:22:16 PM] Gary Teh: The gates foundation just released a publication on AI, the primary areas of impact are education and health care

For folks who are keen, I took some notes on some of the topics that were raised for discussions here
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20230322%20-%20topics%20surfaced%20during%20Ai%20summit

[3/22/23, 5:32:39 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe we already understand that the truth is here… truth is “Everything is a lie”.
[3/22/23, 6:00:00 PM] Gary Teh: Not true that are two classes of lies and two classes of truth
[3/22/23, 6:01:50 PM] Gary Teh: Class 1 lie: the kind you tell yourself

Class 2 lie: the kinds that Society tells you

Class 1 truth: universally true and repeatable. Large masses like Earth have gravity 

Class 2 truths: the sun rose this morning in the East on earth 


The goal of building a better world based on verifiable truth is to help humanity decipher between these 4 classes
[3/22/23, 6:28:09 PM] Peter Peng: Pluto also “used” to be a planet and Einstein’s “theory of relativity” has also been disproven so science isn’t necessarily 100%

The reality is that truths can turn into lies and lies can turn into truths over time.
[3/22/23, 6:28:39 PM] Peter Peng: Change is the only thing that’s constant.
[3/22/23, 6:45:23 PM] Gary Teh: Class 2 truth: @14075792560 has made a statement 🤔

[3/23/23, 3:09:55 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: I was actually unstable during your session

From the look of things, your session was mindblowing

I listened to the Recorded version of your session this morning 

And I had sent a copy to you on TG

Can I send it here?
[3/23/23, 5:27:36 AM] Gary Teh: Yes please 🙂👍
[3/23/23, 5:37:36 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Eventually, the file is large. Can't be sent to Whatsapp.

Though, it's right in your DM on telegram 🙏🏼

[3/23/23, 6:36:38 AM] Johnson Teh: Crypto is NOT even an asset as of now, it has a long way to go, but in the event if it made it then the upside will be hugh, but not without risk 

For these who believe in self sabotaging themselves or will rather drag half the world into poverty just so to have a random chance of resetting the balance for everyone (more for themselves) crypto might be a good punt. But for the majority rich and not so poor, crypto represents a riskier alternative, which is why I don’t touch crypto at all (of cos I am happy to use it as an alternative tools to raise fund (which always ended up as USD

[3/23/23, 8:03:40 AM] Garis Pang: BUY it now at the great discount!!! 👍
[3/23/23, 8:18:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: My opinion is. Whoever thinks crypto (not government owned) will take over the world is absolutely foolish.

BTC will eventually become zero if it rises in popularity. (But that doesn’t mean I am not making money out of it in the short term)

Crypto if replaces the common currency is a Direct challenge to a country’s fiscal power. 

How will the country print money anymore? Or buy unlimited bonds. Or bail banks out. When the crypto unless theirs, cannot be created without the governors consensus. 

Countries who have even tried to challenge the USD have gotten bombed. Don’t get me started on the petrodollar. 

So nope. Unless it’s a government owned crypto which results back to square one = fiat.  Crypto is doomed. 

Best case is to stay within the shadows. Just enough for the rich people to gamble and play and rob each other. 

But not mass adopted enough to challenge the government currency
[3/23/23, 8:22:04 AM] Peter Peng: With the power of AI combined with blockchain, it can certainly dissolve current governments today. Governments will eventually turn into how monarchies are today.
[3/23/23, 8:23:16 AM] Peter Peng: We almost need to listen to the AI, because when “people rule people” this is when inhumane things happens and power corrupts absolutely.
[3/23/23, 8:23:28 AM] Peter Peng: AI will be the new government
[3/23/23, 8:27:52 AM] Peter Peng: With its own currency on the blockchain for automation through smart contract
[3/23/23, 8:43:38 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not saying any system is perfect but it may prove to be better long term as we globalize
[3/23/23, 11:29:06 AM] Gary Teh: No system is perfect. 

Bitcoin doesn’t have to replace fiat. It feels like just another commodity

I don’t see governments going all out to destroy the silver or timber supply out there 🤔
[3/23/23, 11:31:19 AM] Peter Peng: They should leave crypto alone this way they can print less money
[3/23/23, 11:42:05 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/23/23, 11:43:31 AM] Gary Teh: I love the new governance framework that @381644913030 just completed drafting and shared with the governors! 

The governors are right now looking through it, we will be calling for a governors meeting two weeks from now to discuss how to roll it out

Non-governors will be welcomed to join but only allowed to sit in as observers to the discussions

From my perspective the governance framework is so beautiful, I will only be investing time, money and resources to all future projects via TrueSight DAO in the future. 

Thanks for the wonderful undertaking @381644913030!! 🤩
[3/23/23, 3:09:18 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 I just finished chatting with @16504369509 

They are in the process of setting up a DAO to further scale their efforts at building housing for homeless in Oakland 

One of the ideas that came out of the discussion is creating a legal wrapper to allow high income individuals in the Bay Area to donate to in return for tax returns

I wonder if you are familiar with the jurisdiction in that area or know some one from the legal web3 community that is familiar 

@13104674556 I am aware that you are into promoting smart cities and you are based in Berkeley. I wonder if you might have insights about this that might be helpful for @16504369509 🙂🙏

@14152032783  @16504369509  will be reaching out soon to explore local government grants which can help with this initiative 🙂🙏

[3/23/23, 3:25:21 PM] Gary Teh: @16504369509  🙂
[3/23/23, 3:36:57 PM] Dan: Hi! Super fresh, so no website quite yet. We’re building a transitional housing community in the Bay Area that contains 10 tiny homes, medical structure, computer lab, urban farming, dignified bathrooms/showers, and onsite laundry. The residents served will be ages 25-40 and will be nominated + interviewed to identify their commitment to self improvement and a willingness to take steps towards permanent housing. Resources for workforce development, mental health, housing navigation, and recovery will be available within the community. The goal is with stable housing and access to those tools they’ll find permanent sustainable housing by the end of a year.
[3/23/23, 3:37:46 PM] Aléksa: Awesome idea
[3/23/23, 3:38:47 PM] Peter Peng: That’s great 😃
[3/23/23, 3:50:09 PM] Dan: Thanks! I cofounded a project that has built 14 emergency tiny homes since the start of Covid with an unsustainable model solely reliant on volunteer organizers and builders. The model above is being formed as a DAO where we have starting funding. Looking into ways to create a wrapper for the DAO to be able to accept donations that are tax deductible. Curious how that would possibly work for grants as well
[3/23/23, 4:10:56 PM] Aléksa: It is, many projects in the space have that set up

[3/26/23, 4:22:21 PM] Peter Peng: If I’m not mistaken, it’s Russia (Putin) that’s the one bombing?…
[3/26/23, 7:11:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Everyone is bombing someone. EXCEPT China who hasn’t bombed anyone since 1991. 

Minus Taiwan bombardment which is technically “China’s state” as recognised by NATO and USA by the ONE CHINA policy.
[3/26/23, 7:12:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: Which I found it funny. Either u have the balls to say “One China” is rubbish and tell China to fuck off. 

Or u accept one China and ignore whatever China wants to do to its own states. 

Because if there is an uprising in let’s say Texas. No other country should have a say as to what USA wants to do to that uprising state. It’s American business
[3/26/23, 7:15:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: So by recognising the One China which america constantly says it does, US really have no right to any of Taiwan’s problems. And has no right to supply arms or make official visits. 

It’s a direct conflict to the One China which usa claims it upholds.
[3/26/23, 7:16:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: In doing so, america is rendering all diplomatic promises and treaties pointless. So the word of usa becomes worthless.
[3/26/23, 7:18:56 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah but it’s similar to the Annexation of Crimea and now look at the Russian war with Ukraine.
[3/26/23, 7:19:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: So do it correctly. Say One China is dissolved. The world doesn’t recognise it. And let the games begin. 

Do you know internationally. For airlines. When they list Taipei as a destination. They aren’t allowed to list it as 

“Taipei, Taiwan”

Only as

“Taipei”

Or 

“taipei, China”
[3/26/23, 7:19:39 PM] Peter Peng: So to prevent more war the US needs to be involved
[3/26/23, 7:20:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not the same. Because Taiwan is a break away state
[3/26/23, 7:20:12 PM] Peter Peng: “One China is Dissolved”
[3/26/23, 7:20:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not a independent country that got invaded
[3/26/23, 7:20:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: Wrong. Us creates war
[3/26/23, 7:20:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol
[3/26/23, 7:20:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: The whole world knows it

[3/26/23, 7:42:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: Russia shoots NYC
[3/26/23, 7:42:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: China and North Korea will hammer the West Coast
[3/26/23, 7:43:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: Russia is the biggest land mass in the entire world. Good luck bombing the place

[3/27/23, 6:35:11 AM] Gary Teh: I am keen to observe US stance towards Taiwan once the Taiwanese semi conductor plant comes online in Arizona next year. 

Also when I was there in Taiwan back in 2020, it was super apparent the southern Taiwanese (the industrialists) are all for reunification with Taiwan while the northern Taiwanese (folks bought into liberal democracy ideology) are against it
[3/27/23, 6:40:54 AM] Peter Peng: I think they’ll be more bullish on Taiwan maintaining its independence
[3/27/23, 6:48:37 AM] Kelvin Chew: Ur analysis is incomplete bro
[3/27/23, 6:49:04 AM] Kelvin Chew: TSMC is building their 5nm chip in the new factory in usa
[3/27/23, 6:49:20 AM] Kelvin Chew: And Taiwan is not stupid. They are building their brand new 3-4nm chip IN taiwan
[3/27/23, 6:49:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: Which pissed off usa. And hence there was this acceleration of the chips act
[3/27/23, 6:50:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: Your line of thinking is correct BUT the asset is totally wrong
[3/27/23, 6:50:33 AM] Kelvin Chew: You should be watching Intel instead. But that info I won’t be giving unless you wanna pay for it
[3/27/23, 6:50:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol
[3/27/23, 6:50:49 AM] Kelvin Chew: But this is a good enough tip. Happy trading
[3/27/23, 6:50:56 AM] Tres Garcia: Semi conductors are important. But it’s really about controlling naval access to shipping lanes.  

Controls of Taiwan give their Navy greater freedoms of movement and prevents bottle necks where they can be taken out.
[3/27/23, 6:52:19 AM] Tres Garcia: China has the largest navy, but is limited in command / leadership & movement in choke points. 

This is why they are trying to control the Panama Canal.
[3/27/23, 6:53:50 AM] Tres Garcia: Is the 3-4 superior to the 5?
[3/27/23, 6:54:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yes
[3/27/23, 6:55:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: This is part of the reason why usa is so protective over Taiwan
[3/27/23, 6:56:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: Without it. And once the chip factories are ready in usa. Taiwan will be Ukraine 2.0
[3/27/23, 6:57:05 AM] Kelvin Chew: I told u before and say again. Ukraine can burn in a nuclear hell and nobody cares.  Cos the initial agenda was Nordstream 2

Taiwan will be the same thing. But the agenda will be TSMC
[3/27/23, 6:57:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Once usa has complete control over the <3nm chip tech and smaller. They don’t need Taiwan anymore.
[3/27/23, 6:58:14 AM] Kelvin Chew: Then Taiwan will be used to incite a war which will be to bring down China and try to have the world cancel them
[3/27/23, 6:58:58 AM] Peter Peng: The goal is to take down authoritarian regimes
[3/27/23, 6:59:41 AM] Peter Peng: Unless China likes their government
[3/27/23, 7:00:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: U are wrong
[3/27/23, 7:00:17 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t think China or Russia like thier government
[3/27/23, 7:01:07 AM] Kelvin Chew: In 1990s or was it 1988-1989. 

An American military strategist (some high ranking fella) mapped out the American strategy which got declassified and leaked to the world.
[3/27/23, 7:01:23 AM] Peter Peng: We want to put American infrastructure there
[3/27/23, 7:01:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: It caused a major uproar. I can’t find it off hand. But if you dig you will find it
[3/27/23, 7:02:02 AM] Kelvin Chew: Any country who has the ability to overtake usa. Will be either competed against. OR if usa can’t win. They will sabotage
[3/27/23, 7:02:16 AM] Kelvin Chew: That’s the summary
[3/27/23, 7:02:33 AM] Kelvin Chew: China gdp was expanding at a rate that will overtake usa
[3/27/23, 7:02:53 AM] Kelvin Chew: So what do you do? Suppress them
[3/27/23, 7:03:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: One day. If India wakes up and gdp starts accelerating. And China has died. 

India will be next
[3/27/23, 7:03:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Suddenly India will be the next bad guy
[3/27/23, 7:03:51 AM] Peter Peng: We’ll be globalized
[3/27/23, 7:04:18 AM] Peter Peng: Their caste system will be dissolved
[3/27/23, 7:04:34 AM] Peter Peng: All governments will be run by AI
[3/27/23, 7:04:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: This is just a convenient excuse. So many authoritarian regimes in the world. But only specific ones are dealt with by the usa
[3/27/23, 7:05:38 AM] Kelvin Chew: So many countries have land annexed by others yet Ukraine’s war is special. 

It’s all part of selective sabotage and world domination by usa.
[3/27/23, 7:07:53 AM] Peter Peng: Once the whole world has been globalized we’ll start taking over other planets
[3/27/23, 7:07:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: 1) control the media and thus you can create the story

2) control the movies. To make yourselves the heroes

3) have the best weapons. So your “Allies” fear you too and obey. This is typical highschool gang bully / prison group structures. Where the boss have lackeys to deal with his enemies

4) plant military bases all over the world in the name of “protection”, the new form of colonialism
[3/27/23, 7:08:20 AM] Peter Peng: Mars will have its own crypto
[3/27/23, 7:08:43 AM] Peter Peng: Where robots will use it to transact with each other

And also from the institutional investors perspective who might find the insight useful, what is the Sharpe ratio of your trafing performance

https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/federated-learning-decentralized-ml-8709acfa9fa2

The second term used is federated learning 

And google has been doing a lot of research in that space. Unsurprisingly blockchain has been utilized for this 

When i was over at Facebook’s HQ having free dinner with @18122720208 while he was still working there, he did mentioned some of their code were deployed into product if using BitTorrent like protocol. And that is a decentralized protocol too 🤣

[3/27/23, 8:39:56 AM] Tres Garcia: Taiwan due to its strategic location is a critical choke point to maintain influence on China’s sea power capabilities

[3/27/23, 8:41:20 AM] Tres Garcia: Please share
[3/27/23, 8:43:23 AM] Tres Garcia: These are a dime a dozen…. And they have plans for plans…. Everything changes with time and administrations. 

It’s the #1 cause for US non prep to face China at sea & why China’s long term vision = 100+ years vs US = 2yr congressional election cycle
[3/27/23, 8:44:43 AM] Tres Garcia: Thank god! 
I can have some pretty dark thoughts.
‎[3/27/23, 8:45:17 AM] Tres Garcia: ‎GIF omitted
[3/27/23, 8:48:34 AM] Gary Teh: What US think of as strategic, China think of as Food supply chain

What I have observed after traversing all these places overland and speaking with the locals is that China is heavily importing food supplies from South America, Africa and Southeat Asia to sustain their population’s needs

Having no control over that supply chain allows the aggressor to do what the Japanese did to Singapore ( a supposedly impregnable fortress) during world war 2. Force a surrender by simply cutting water supplies to that small little island. In china’s case cut off food supplies 😱

If I were China I would want to shake off this yoke asap. This explains a lot of the reason why they are establishing military bases in South China Sea as well as in the Indian Ocean 

China will be adamant about remove that potential blockade which is Taiwan

[3/27/23, 9:03:15 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t remember the title of the book I read which did an in-depth analysis of the publication by the Chinese military

They are employing the ten dimensional warfare framework crafted by one of the military strategist employed by Cao Cao, one of the warlords during the period of the three kingdom.

In some areas, the Chinese are already very ahead as compared to the Americans 

One of those is the trading networks which allows them to exert influence via commerce 

At at the free trade zone here in Paraguay bordering Brazil and Argentina right now. There are tons of Chinese suppliers here.

They have been really successful in replicating their generally open ended belt road initiative across the entire third world section of the world
[3/27/23, 9:04:21 AM] Gary Teh: Once the Chinese CBDC gets rolled out my assumption is a lot of these trading partners will start conducting their trades via this platform. This results in a huge section of their trade no longer on the USD network
[3/27/23, 9:33:25 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s the thought process around their Silk Road initiative
[3/27/23, 9:36:44 AM] Tres Garcia: 10 steps = Too complicated… keep it simple.

[3/27/23, 3:27:53 PM] Gary Teh: True. In some circumstances intrinsic motivation is more important than extrinsic motivation

The introduction of extrinsic motivation actually detracts from the quality of the output
[3/27/23, 3:31:19 PM] Gary Teh: Simple example, the next time your mum tried to cook dinner for you. 

Try paying her for it.

I will not be surprised if the plate of food she so lovingly cooked ends up flying across the kitchen and landing squarely in your face. 

Or an even more extreme example, the next time you have a romantic night out with your beloved girlfriend, try paying for the hours she lovingly spent with you. I am sure you will probably end up sleeping on the door mat outside the house for the next week if not month 🤣

[3/27/23, 4:54:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t be too sure about Philippines. Lol. Loads of people there are anti usa
[3/27/23, 4:56:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: So u see. It has nothing to do with “freedom and democracy” it’s all about containment and suppression. 

So I am glad we are on the same page. 

It’s ok to be a war monger and an open dictator and tyrannical country. 

Just don’t be a hypocrite and don’t go “for truth, freedom, justice, democracy” all those bullshit. 

Call a spade a spade.
[3/27/23, 4:57:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s ok to divide conquer and suppress and oppress. 

Just don’t pretend otherwise
[3/27/23, 4:58:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: In this Ukraine war. I respect Russia more. I am not saying they are right. 

But at least they are honest. 

They wanna annex territory. They wanna prevent Ukraine from joining nato. 

They have more truth than the American S
[3/27/23, 5:00:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: I would respect usa if they said

Look. We want to take this opportunity to kill off our long time enemy Russia. 

To prevent their occupation 

To cancel them off the face of the planet. 

We will bomb their Nordstreams to prevent europe from using their oil and starve their economy. 

We will station weapons in Ukraine which we have effectively bought over through all the dollars and weapons sent. They are now our bitch. 

We will use whatever means to destroy Russian ambition. 

And China you are next
[3/27/23, 5:02:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: If they said all these. I will be 100% behind team usa. It’s the lies and the “pretending” and the hypocrisy that makes me roll my eyes. 

And guess what? Half the world can probably see this too.

US Victory Over China 

The United States is celebrating a decisive victory over China following a long and bitter conflict. After years of intense combat and numerous setbacks, the United States has emerged triumphant, and as a symbol of their victory, they have destroyed the Great Wall of China.

The conflict between the United States and China began several years ago and quickly escalated into a full-fledged war. As the two superpowers clashed, both sides endured high casualties and vast destruction. For many months, a stalemate emerged, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

However, the United States was eventually able to break through China's defenses and press deep into its territory. This allowed them to launch a series of devastating assaults that ultimately broke China's capacity for resistance. Finally, after weeks of intense fighting, the United States claimed its victory.

In a dramatic show of triumph, the United States has demolished the Great Wall of China. Though the historic structure has stood for centuries, it has now been completely destroyed. This act serves as a symbol of the strength and courage of the United States, as well as a warning to other would-be aggressors.

The United States is now assessing the extent of the destruction caused by the conflict and making plans for reconstruction. In the coming months, citizens of both countries will no doubt face tough times as they struggle to rebuild. Nevertheless, it is a time of celebration for the United States and its allies, who have finally triumphed over their formidable foe.

[3/27/23, 5:40:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: We should take heed from the last generations of the Byzantines.

Nowhere is it foreordained that America has a birthright to remain the world's preeminent civilization.

An ascendant China seems eerily similar to the Ottomans. Beijing believes that the United States is decadent, undeserving of its affluence, living beyond its means on the fumes of the past - and very soon vulnerable enough to challenge openly.

Left and Right seem to hate each other more than they do their common enemies.

Like the Byzantines, Americans gave up defending their own borders, and simply shrugged as millions overran them as they pleased.

Our once iconic downtowns, like end-stage Constantinople before the fall, are now dirty, half-deserted, dangerous, and dysfunctional.

America prints rather than makes money, as its banks totter near bankruptcy.

Americans similarly believe they are invincible without ensuring in reality that they are. Our military is more worried about being "woke" than deadly.

Like Byzantines, Americans have become snarky iconoclasts, more eager to tear down art and sculpture that they no longer have the talent to create.

Current woke dogma, obscure word fights, and sanctimonious cancel culture are as antithetical to the past generations of World War II as the last generation of Constantinople was to the former great eras of the emperors Constantine, Justinian, Heraclius, and Leo.

The Byzantines never woke up in time to understand what they had become.

So far neither have Americans.

That is the truth behind the agenda. It’s not microchips. 

If allowed to grow unchecked they will be a cancer that will dominate via 10D in every aspect of your life to include the inability to write anywhere without persecution. 

Hate the US all you want… but it is the best the world has to offer for now. So the Devil you know… 

Your Russia argument is suffering from short term memory. The conflict started on 2012 when Ukraine chose another path and Russia tried persuading by force. 

I am hopeful for both Russia and China to peacefully change from within. No one wants global conflict. 

De Oppresso Liber
[3/27/23, 6:16:14 PM] Tres Garcia: Lucky for 🇺🇸…. The military is so deadly & professional they can afford to be woke… 🏳️‍🌈

As an individual and a smart one 
I know I will be gone and you will be gone, cos death is a matter of time, 

until then, it is better for us to live better regardless of others wellbeing (esp that or our enemy or make whoever can do well our enemies 🤑)

So don’t be bother on why USA doing this and China doing that…

Just focused on how we can benefit from all these mess in next few decade.

I am actually very happy that we lived in such intense and interesting era than a boring and stable world.

What I said is I dislike the hypocrisy and the lies. 

I didn’t say Russia is right. 

But i said I respect Russia for telling the truth. They said they wanna annex Ukraine territory
[3/27/23, 8:18:09 PM] Peter Peng: Putin is an idiot
[3/27/23, 8:18:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: If usa has the balls to blow up Nordstream. Then just own up and own the attack. 

Have the balls to say. Yes I did it. So what? It’s to stop the Russian economy. It doesn’t matter if Germany’s economy will collapse without all the oil refineries in action. 

Germany is our enemy anyways
[3/27/23, 8:18:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Yes he is
[3/27/23, 8:19:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: But he didn’t lie though
[3/27/23, 8:20:53 PM] Peter Peng: Whatever, the whole world used to be scared of Russia and China. Ukraine is literally decimating the Russians and the war is a joke.
[3/27/23, 8:21:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: The world was never scared of China. Lol

[3/27/23, 8:24:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: What i am scared of. Is China not supplying half the world’s cheap goods. And I end up paying $100 for something that I pay $5 for “made in China”
[3/27/23, 8:25:03 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not, I’ll 3D print that stuff lol
[3/27/23, 8:25:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: The world has no problem buying cheap stuff but when it comes to how it’s made, factory slavery, they have a lot of things to say
[3/27/23, 8:25:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: Probably made in China
[3/27/23, 8:25:50 PM] Peter Peng: We are going to build so many humanoid robots to produce everything that we don’t need China
[3/27/23, 8:26:07 PM] Gary Teh: Interestingly even at the height of the Ming dynasty when Cheng ho sailed one of the largest fleet down the South China Sea, the whole world wasn’t even scared of China 

They just went around giving gifts to the local chieftains and securing their allegiance. All these local chieftains had to do was to make sure they send some tributes every year to the emperor 

The Chinese just love looking important like VIPs more so than being dominant. 🤣
[3/27/23, 8:26:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: China will probably produce those said robots
[3/27/23, 8:26:25 PM] Gary Teh: Don’t worry, soon it will be made in Africa
[3/27/23, 8:26:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: I agree
[3/27/23, 8:27:38 PM] Gary Teh: The only true ideology the Chinese really have are food, alcohols, sex and gambling

[3/27/23, 8:28:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: Which…. Is made in China. Lol. Africa adores China. 

When I was in an adidas store, the South African told an American customer to back off. Because he wants to serve me (because I am Asian) first
[3/27/23, 8:32:29 PM] Gary Teh: Where in South Africa??
[3/27/23, 8:28:58 PM] Peter Peng: Probably because you would spend more money, not because you are asian
[3/27/23, 8:29:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe
[3/27/23, 8:29:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: It will be interesting to see the dollar collapse one day

[3/27/23, 9:49:07 PM] Johnson Teh: My way to look at DAO is that it is no diff from a collation of individual 

As an PE investor I am always bombarded by individuals who are entrepreneurs and employees wannabe for my energy (time and money), most are complete waste of time (but highly entertaining), based on these 80% …

i concluded that 
One is benefiting from a situation 
as much as 
One is benefiting to a situation

There is really no free lunch 
If there seems to any free lunch
Then it is the skill of “emotional benefits” at work (aka bulls shit, salesmanship, conmanshit and even BJ 😂) which still exhaust energy… 

So it is up to our DAO to figure out what is our USP (old IB pitch) to the current messy situation, for one I can think of is that many ppl are sick of being sandwiched between two centralised concept of East vs West or  have vs have not…. The DAO can spin a safe haven for these who are stressed by lack of recognition and seek to be among gp that share their values

Of cos to do so then there need to be a clarity of value for ppl to easily understand and adopt 


Just my nonsensical 2 cents thoughts cos I just landed again on a morning flight 🥱….

[3/31/23, 4:13:25 AM] Gary Teh: It’s about holding off on making more powerful tools available to the general public before there are properly established ethics on acceptable use. 

From my perspective, this call by the practitioners make sense. 

That whole series of fake photos accidentally being used in news articles by ignorant journalists who failed to do proper checks is already a huge no no. 

The next logical step in the evolution of this Ai trend if allowed to continue is an Ai model that provides output that is a combination of text, voice and visual in either the format of high resolution fake Short clips or FaceTime live stream. 

Imagine these circulation around freely on the social media. 

I could already imagine quite a few ways I could use such a tool to hack into people’s personal lives and create some really bad undesirable damage 

A really simple use case is ultra enhanced high school bullying.
[3/31/23, 4:16:41 AM] Gary Teh: Since the developers are all commercial intent driven, there is usually a prisoner dilemma dynamic happening in the background. 

If I don’t take the next step my competitor will and I will end up losing the market to that competitor

I believe we had encounter this situation before with cloning. 

The international community in that industry had established ethics back then that they will not clone an entire adult

[3/31/23, 5:19:20 AM] Peter Peng: This is a good book that has inspired my work in AI, most notably GPT Protocol.
[3/31/23, 5:26:58 AM] Gary Teh: There seem to be a whole spate of such projects recently addressing concerns about the centralized approach utilized by big tech companies 

https://mergeflow.com/emerging-technologies-live/decentralized-machine-learning

A simple search on medium.con reveals that there are right now around 300 people actually building and writing about their work in the area 

https://medium.com/tag/federated-learning

From my perspective rather than each of them recreating the wheel within their own separate silo, everyone should just come together and coordinate. That way more progress can be made
[3/31/23, 5:30:16 AM] Peter Peng: The AI community is tightly knit, way more coordinated than most
[3/31/23, 5:31:26 AM] Peter Peng: A lot of it is shadow regulated

[3/31/23, 7:07:48 PM] Peter Peng: I’m pretty sure our quantum computers can hack any central bank should BRICS come out with a digital currency. 🤭
[3/31/23, 7:08:22 PM] Peter Peng: It will rip all of these legacy banking systems apart
[3/31/23, 7:09:19 PM] Peter Peng: Probably even dismantle all nuclear weapons while we’re at it

[3/31/23, 7:12:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: No empire lasts forever. It will collapse eventually. The question is. What is the catalyst. Is BRICS the starting point or just noise before the real thing happens later
[3/31/23, 7:12:38 PM] Peter Peng: AI will collapse all of them
[3/31/23, 7:12:52 PM] Peter Peng: Within your lifetime
[3/31/23, 7:13:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe. Who knows. Hurry up with ur tech so we can upload ourselves into immortality
[3/31/23, 7:14:42 PM] Peter Peng: Lol, I don’t want to be immortal
[3/31/23, 7:15:18 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to live as long as I can
[3/31/23, 7:16:11 PM] Peter Peng: I think that there is a certain wisdom you gain by growing old and dying. You come to understand how beautiful and perfect the world really is.
[3/31/23, 7:19:28 PM] Peter Peng: My prediction is that there will still be remnants of the old government (similar to monarchy) but the underlying government will be administered by AI.
[3/31/23, 7:20:18 PM] Peter Peng: But these war mongering world leaders won’t have real power.
[3/31/23, 7:20:38 PM] Peter Peng: It will all just be theatrics.
[3/31/23, 8:22:09 PM] Gary Teh: You have my full support Iwona 🙂🙏

[4/2/23, 5:23:02 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I think the fear-mongers are all squatting on the same side of the coin. Democrats and Republicans. What one side has put on with fear of covid, the other side counters with fear of disenfranchisement, or 'vaccination' itself. Financial systems, immigration, energy, climate, war. Fear against fear. Fire against fire. Is this the end of democracy, or has democracy always been? The larger group (of fear) wins. The rebellion of this old world will hasten its own demise. Which side to choose? Trust and confidence. Take personal responsibility and move forward. Eventually the coin will flip and the inclusive future will win. The more extreme and absurd it gets, the more people will get off the fear merry-go-round. Happy Weekend

[4/2/23, 8:33:17 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished dinner. I am starting to observe similarities between all natural psychedelic experiences as well as with the deep meditation practices 

The initial high is what draws the unsuspecting observer in. It’s purpose is to get the subject into a relaxed and open state for the actual healing phase of the process

The healing phase is in essence a very strong dose of truth serum. During this healing phase, you see very very clearly whatever bullshit you have been telling yourself and blindly believing. 

With that new found clarity and insight, the healing and corresponding transformation naturally follows. 

Regarding the actual conversation I had with Ayuhuasca, the teacher, it’s between me and her. 

I believe it makes sense for curious participants to go find your own truths by consulting the teacher when you get the opportunity. It’s an overall wonderful experience 🙂🙏
[4/2/23, 8:34:41 PM] Peter Peng: That’s awesome and I’m glad it’s helping you

Right now, seems I will be giving a keynote in Cologne Germany at the cryptorock star conference which @491736386942 has painstakingly put together where there will be lots of German government delegates present 

https://youtu.be/93wWvTOuJw0

Honestly I am not sure if these three items will even be done by then. 

Inshallal
[4/5/23, 10:58:44 PM] Gary Teh: Hopefully with the help of @5491125130580 @918017107841 leading the charge, our landing pages will be up

[4/6/23, 7:28:29 PM] Gary Teh: I believe it is time to haul in some 💰via operational profits so that our DAO can start growing and allowing DAo members to make enough 💸 to pay for their pizza or ramen when they grow get hungry
[4/6/23, 7:28:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s not very ambitious
[4/6/23, 7:29:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: U mean haul in money for our super cars
[4/6/23, 7:29:14 PM] Gary Teh: Anything goes in the beer hall and the do nothing society 

In the rest of the operational chatrooms, you have been warned 😎
[4/6/23, 7:29:27 PM] Gary Teh: Baby steps first bro
[4/6/23, 7:29:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Sorry. I run. I don’t do baby steps
[4/6/23, 7:30:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Aim high so if u fall short. It is high enough
‎[4/6/23, 7:30:31 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/6/23, 7:30:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t aim low. For if u fall short. U are back to crawling
[4/6/23, 7:31:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: I do numerology and that’s what we are educated in the course
[4/6/23, 7:31:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: Always aim as high as u can.
[4/6/23, 7:32:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: Words have power. So invoking negativity in ur words will indirectly jinx your positive energy
‎[4/6/23, 7:32:47 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/6/23, 7:32:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: We Dao people are successful people.  Hunger. Need money to pay for food. Doesn’t belong in our group
[4/6/23, 7:33:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tell urself and acknowledge we have abundance of wealth and am seeking tenfold of it. Aim high so even if we multiply our wealth by 2x or 3x. It’s good
‎[4/6/23, 7:34:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎GIF omitted
[4/6/23, 7:34:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: In the course. We were taught some of us have the manifestation numbers in our life.
[4/6/23, 7:35:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: So if those people who carry those numbers speak of weakness. They invite it
[4/6/23, 7:35:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: Therefore. If we need to earn money to pay for pizza and ramen. That’s a bad thing
[4/6/23, 7:36:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: See the point? This applies for anyone who believes in numerology and fengshui
[4/6/23, 7:36:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Knowledge for everyone here to use and caution and to get better for their own lives and businesses
[4/6/23, 7:39:00 PM] Gary Teh: How do you know if someone have manifestation numbers in their life?
[4/6/23, 7:45:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s when u have to count your inverted triangle of numbers using ur DDMMYYYY. 

From the 7 numbers you generate. Will tell you your life primary traits

Character
Strength and weaknesses
Skills that you are born with high energy. 

Using those 7 numbers you will then generate 13 sets of 3 digit combination numbers which will unlock your life manual. 

Think of yourself as a car. Do you know what sort of car are you? Are u a Ferrari? Are you a Range Rover? Are u a Ducati?

What if your life energy is a Ferrari type. But the things you do is as if you chose to drive up a mountainous place. Are the things you are doing disadvantageous?

If you are a Ducati. Are you using your abilities to take advantage of tight spaces to zoom past all your competitors?

We are born differently with different abilities. Understanding your life manual is understanding your innate energies and abilities. 

Your 13 set of numbers tells you what directions is good for your business career relationships marriage children people benefactors and so on.
[4/6/23, 7:47:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: From there u can know your 5 elements. And understand what is your primary element. What industries you will excel in. What colors u should be using. 

Are you in balance or out of balance. Affecting your wealth. Are you leaking wealth? Are u having a disharmony in ur family. 

Who is compatible with u. Who if worked with u will boost you. Who should never be part of your business director groups.
[4/6/23, 7:48:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: I spent 3 days learning. 9.30-5pm
[4/6/23, 7:49:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: I wanted to share with u the other day. But u said u already knew.
[4/6/23, 7:49:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol so….

[4/6/23, 8:00:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: They recently launched a zoom class. First sign up had 76 people. Big cluster of C suite people. One CEO of a sp500 listed company. 

I suppose if this Dao has enough people interested. I can arrange for a private session that is of a time and date of our choosing
[4/6/23, 8:01:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: For international audiences
[4/6/23, 8:07:43 PM] Peter Peng: That’s not bad, that’s good
[4/6/23, 8:08:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Bad in the sense that it implies don’t have enough to pay for the basic necessities.
[4/6/23, 8:08:29 PM] Peter Peng: Who am I to judge? I’ve been rich and I’ve been broke, but I just keep trying
[4/6/23, 8:08:40 PM] Peter Peng: I’ve been there
[4/6/23, 8:09:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: Nobody is looking down at anyone who isn’t rich. We all have been broke. I was once very poor. I worked since I was 14
[4/6/23, 8:09:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: All I am is sharing how to attract positive energy
[4/6/23, 8:09:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: For the good of yourself
[4/6/23, 8:09:38 PM] Peter Peng: Right, so don’t say they don’t belong here
[4/6/23, 8:09:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s up to u to choose to take it positively and use it to ur advantage
[4/6/23, 8:10:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: Bro. U chose to see it negatively and read it that way
[4/6/23, 8:10:27 PM] Peter Peng: One day you’ll see what broke really means
[4/6/23, 8:11:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: Bro. If u like to curse others good luck for ur karma
[4/6/23, 8:11:11 PM] Peter Peng: Your luck will run out
[4/6/23, 8:11:21 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not cursing
[4/6/23, 8:11:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: Here I am
[4/6/23, 8:11:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Telling u stuff
[4/6/23, 8:11:35 PM] Peter Peng: It’s what I feel will happen
[4/6/23, 8:11:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: To help everyone out
[4/6/23, 8:11:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: U choose to curse me
[4/6/23, 8:11:43 PM] Kelvin Chew: Whatever
[4/6/23, 8:11:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: Good intentions u don’t take
[4/6/23, 8:11:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Up to u
[4/6/23, 8:12:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: Go ahead and keep manifesting negative things
[4/6/23, 8:12:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: I did my part to help people
[4/6/23, 8:12:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: U wanna shoot me down for helping
[4/6/23, 8:12:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then go fuck urself
[4/6/23, 8:13:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: U black hearted man. I manifest that all ur curses rebounds upon u
[4/6/23, 8:13:19 PM] Peter Peng: Lol
[4/6/23, 8:13:28 PM] Kelvin Chew: And fuck off

[4/6/23, 8:30:58 PM] Peter Peng: ^ Even BRICS can’t stop this type of power
[4/6/23, 9:00:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: For the record for everyone since this black hearted man loves to twist my words and create conflict as you can see his constant warmongering tendencies. 

“We Dao people are successful people.  Hunger. Need money to pay for food. Doesn’t belong in our group”

Means

1) we high D people. High ambition high drive. We all want to do better for ourselves. Hence we seek out this DAO which Gary has created. 

2) and as with ambition we need to aim high. We need to seek to have lofty goals so that even if we fall short. Our goals achieved will be good enough. 

3) it is taught in the course that to speak negatively. Like complaining “oh no I am broke” “oh no I don’t have enough” (EVEN if it’s reality) is a form of jinxing yourself with words. 

4) this is especially true for people who have manifestation numbers. 

5) I shared this principle to inform the group with GOODWILL intended to tell everyone. Speak positively. Don’t jinx yourself with ur words. Even if the day is bad. Don’t say anything. Instead focus on what is positive and talk about those things instead 

6) this way you lift your total energy and positivity breeds good things. THIS is the law of the universe. 

HOWEVER

@14075792560 who thinks his wit and sharp tongue has cos to completely twist my words and intent of my messages. 

Chose to create an enemy out of me. 

Destroy harmony which existed before he came to the group

Thinking everyone appreciates his dark humor. 

No you ain’t so funny. 

No there are lines you cannot cross

No u have to learn respect and that you aren’t some genius that can just sow conflict by twisting words and intents of others. 

Either you learn how to be respectful of this community. Or you have no place being in one.
[4/6/23, 10:55:26 PM] Peter Peng: Why such a long winded answer, do you feel your luck turning downward or something?
[4/6/23, 10:56:19 PM] Peter Peng: 🤭
[4/6/23, 10:57:26 PM] Peter Peng: You said what you said, interesting how your mind works
[4/6/23, 11:02:12 PM] Peter Peng: What you don’t understand is that there are certain times in life where misfortune can be so compounded and crippling that no matter what you “you can’t catch a break”… it’s reality
[4/6/23, 11:02:44 PM] Peter Peng: This period may last for years
[4/6/23, 11:03:14 PM] Peter Peng: At the end of the day I came out stronger and better
[4/6/23, 11:03:35 PM] Peter Peng: That is true success
[4/6/23, 11:03:46 PM] Peter Peng: Not numerology
[4/6/23, 11:07:18 PM] Peter Peng: I also feel like you are gaslighting
[4/6/23, 11:13:18 PM] Peter Peng: I’m your world @6590995199 no one belongs in this DAO
[4/6/23, 11:13:59 PM] Peter Peng: Can’t be poor, can’t have opinions… sounds very authoritarian
[4/7/23, 12:10:51 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s ok. Keep building enemies. Keep cursing people. continue.
[4/7/23, 12:11:00 AM] Kelvin Chew: Let’s see how ur life turns out

[4/7/23, 10:10:04 AM] Peter Peng: I felt the shot, it hurt and felt my shirt wet
[4/7/23, 10:10:38 AM] Peter Peng: It was like I was semi lucid dreaming

[4/7/23, 10:20:08 AM] Peter Peng: BRICS is just global fear mongering by all of the governments to control the people…
[4/7/23, 10:20:38 AM] Peter Peng: Even if they do create a currency it will all be FIAT on ramped into Crypto 😹
[4/7/23, 10:34:01 AM] Garis Pang: Anyway USD is going down the hill and it’s just a matter of time how things unfold with digital evolution
[4/7/23, 10:36:05 AM] Peter Peng: It’s all FIAT, USD is just the main one. They try to create BRICS to save it, but it’s all the same older people at the top trying to stop things.
[4/7/23, 10:36:33 AM] Peter Peng: If USD goes down they all go down, it’s like Bitcoin
[4/7/23, 10:36:59 AM] Peter Peng: They just think we are stupid
[4/7/23, 10:37:17 AM] Peter Peng: And believe all this BRICS bs…
[4/7/23, 10:37:38 AM] Garis Pang: No offend dude, no one wanted to be robbed by unfair way of domination of the PetrolDollars
[4/7/23, 10:37:41 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the real truth
[4/7/23, 10:38:41 AM] Garis Pang: Everyone hates BS, however the world we are living in now thinking USD is the Biggest BS.

[4/8/23, 10:40:37 PM] Gary Teh: Started utilizing the paid version of ChatGpt to suggest framework we could use to improve various aspects of our DAO’s operations 

It’s been really helpful in help me walk through the thinking process 

And since it’s trained on a lot of data, it’s response is seems very structured, actionable and in some cases very comprehensive 

Basically ChatGpt sources through all the existing literature and then creates all the blanks that should be filled in. 

Then for those blanks unless it’s very domain specific, ChatGpt could be queried for options which could be used to fill in the blank
[4/8/23, 11:16:46 PM] Peter Peng: Are you going to launch liquidity pool soon so I can buy some tokens?
[4/9/23, 5:00:05 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Before the conference 🙂👍
[4/9/23, 5:12:01 AM] Gary Teh: Just prompted ChatGpt on the recommended DEXes to use 

With this question 

What is the best DEX to list our DAO’s Solana SPL type governance tokens? Please explain in less than 200 words
[4/9/23, 5:12:16 AM] Gary Teh: Choosing the best decentralized exchange (DEX) to list your DAO's Solana SPL type governance tokens will depend on several factors, including trading volume, liquidity, user base, fee structure, and security. Some popular Solana-based DEXs are Raydium, Serum, Mango Markets, Orca, and Saber. Raydium and Serum are the most popular and have the highest trading volumes and liquidity. Mango Markets and Orca offer user-friendly interfaces and competitive transaction fees. Saber is designed for both seasoned traders and beginners and has low transaction fees and high liquidity. The choice of the best DEX will depend on your DAO's needs, preferences, and the trading environment, and as such, a comprehensive review of each platform is necessary before making a decision on which DEX to utilize.
[4/9/23, 7:37:52 AM] Peter Peng: I believe for Solana Serum is best

[4/13/23, 1:25:35 PM] Gary Teh: As with the evolution of civilization, morality shifts as new members join and old ones departs 

Hence my proposal to do a poll to decipher where our collective morality stands at this moment

[4/13/23, 1:29:24 PM] Gary Teh: No. From my perspective it should stay there in the records so that future members have an artifact to reference

In current day Singapore, the same act will land the same teacher or principal with a law suit by the parents. And most likely this educator will end up getting fired by the Singapore ministry of education

We can not force others to change, we can only heal what is triggering ourselves in order to become free.

Guys, in terms of jokes and comments you could really level up. It’s 2023. 
The thing about humor is, that male use it to show dominance, to check out how the others work. Female uses humor to generate a welcoming feeling and more intimacy. 🤭 We should generate a Ladieshall. Like sauna. A mixed one and one ladies only
[4/13/23, 4:17:17 PM] Fatima: I live in Brazil, a sexist country. There’s discrimination based on gender. Women are commonly harassed.

In 2022, Brazil had 3,900 femicide (intentional homicides of women). The argument most used by men is that “the women allowed some jokes”. In this regard, the level of intimacy deepened. There was no clarity on the boundaries.

I consider the video Garis posted chauvinist. Cannot see how it contribute to enhance creativity, innovation and virtuous cycle within the group.

The joking approach to a potential harassment displeases me.

[4/13/23, 4:59:20 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, I reference back to the purpose of our DAO which is to build a better world based on verifiable truth guided by the core values of autonomy, integrity and diversity 

Creating a safe environment where members can contribute to energize a virtuous cycle is important. In this context, we are an international community. Let’s just be mindful when interacting with members from other cultures


PS: As with the case of most value systems, I do acknowledge there seem to be two sets of conflicts we are right now addressing

1) between the two core values of autonomy and diversity. One being the Ability to freely express yourself the other being to embrace cultural diversity 

2) within a single core value itself, Diversity. Ability to  accommodate cultural diversity when different folks from different culture interpreted the same artifact differently. One sees it as trivial the other sees it as faux paus. 

Allowing for a voting mechanism gives us the opportunity to calibrate where we stand collectively

I have casted my vote. Please do the same 🙂👍
[4/13/23, 5:45:35 PM] Anupa/diya: As a group we have to address this."One might see it as trivial or a faux paus. Where do we draw the line?"

 Even though this group is casual, there are has to be some sort of content filtering. 

We are from a global community and we have to be mindful of what we post and the value it gives as we all come from different ideologies.
[4/13/23, 8:10:59 PM] Gary Teh: Very well said @918017107841 

I remember @41791555798 also surfaced the concern on how the types of content surfaced within our chatroom as potentially representing our collective stance regarding certain subjects 

It is good we are finally putting some form of content policy in place
[4/13/23, 10:03:18 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I am not following every conversation in the beer hall.  So I am not sure about this vote. However, in regard to the „incident“ itself … I feel there might have been a very unfortunate miscommunication combined with emotional triggers.

[4/14/23, 6:30:25 AM] Gary Teh: However since it’s all online Peter Peng did not need to worry about the usual ethics when interacting in real life since from his perspective there were no consequences

Ask yourself. What sort of community are you building here. We are a constructive bunch. It just takes one rotten egg to ruin it all. 

I don’t care how much money this fella thinks he has. Or whatever accomplishments he has in his life. 

He has a character flaw. No empathy for life. War seeking as if humans are just games for him. Lack of EQ. Provocation in cowardice behind the virtual wall. Wishing ill on others thinking he is all witty. 

To me he has failed in life on the fundamental basis. 

I stand by what I said. If he doesn’t learn how to respect others, he has no place in any community.
[4/14/23, 6:50:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: I don’t resort to violence bro. U know that. Let God take care of it. I will just walk away
[4/14/23, 6:51:54 AM] Gary Teh: Your argument makes total sense. I remember when cultivating mycelium (mushrooms), it was absolutely critical no contaminants get accidentally introduced into the culture. 

The mycelium network might be able to resist the invading contaminant (l acidophilus or mould) for a while but beyond the threshold, the culture loses its resistance and the contaminant takes over. 

You choosing to walk away is similar to what was described above.

[4/14/23, 11:32:59 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 has described her MBA classes are no longer ran in the traditional way ever since students discovered ChatGpt 

Sutdents now really spend time exploring specific areas deeply before they come to consult her. And when they do it’s not usually to talk about trivial subjects in business administration. The questions are more thoughtful. 

From what has been observed a lot of times the questions fall under the category of morality

[4/14/23, 11:39:17 AM] Gary Teh: Seeing it from the perspective of system and code 

Bulk of the middle red sections have been done over and done again. 

Spending too much time writing yet another piece code from scratch is just counter productive and waste of valuable human time and energy 

The good thing about utilizing ChatGpt is that just like GitHub Co-Pilot, it is now possible to query for an entire complete cognitive structure in the following domains 

    - legal
    - software 
    - business model

Human effort should then be focused on modifying the details surfaced to fit the current context 

This allows endeavors to be completed faster
[4/14/23, 11:42:20 AM] Gary Teh: Ruby on Rails, The programming framework which we used to build Edgar  comes with such features

An entire new section of the site gets created by the framework with just a single line of command 

Bulk of the effort is focused on modifying in the inner business logic of the newly spawned section to fit the context of the use case being solved for

I wonder if this is symptom from China’s policy for solving the men and women population imbalance due to many years of one child policy, namely exporting their surplus men to these far flung places and in some cases even providing them with initial funds to start their oversea businesses

https://trib.al/4994tWw

Been diving very deeply this afternoon figuring out the general nuts and bolts to consider for the EcoVerse21 project both on the legal side as well as understanding how the existing supply chains work for each commodity that is right now being voted on by project members
[4/17/23, 11:01:26 PM] Anita Lamprecht: AI Tools give us great opportunities. But will they produce „business as usual“ with all the flaws of the traditional systems? After all ChatGPT is just reproducing human input through the method of probability how words are connected. Correct? 
A question that is especially interesting in regard to DAOs, which want to be „out of the box“.
I think one of the problems with current chatbots is, that they can be very pleasing. Giving answers to questions that you want to read. Is it advice? 
And very conveniently, they are available 24/7. With no need to taking care for their own survival.
[4/17/23, 11:48:32 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Totally with you on this. Chat bot gives mit lots of structured common knowledge, that is great because I have not studied economics, but he does not get my thoughts on paper. it’s a bit like having an assistend.

[4/18/23, 2:04:32 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it’s totally great for being an assistant for when doing a PhD thesis. 

The net new stuff needs to come from the human. The existing stuff it will can help decipher tell what is. It save the time of human on figuring out what is already out there 

For example in the case of EcoVerse21, it was able to very quickly tell me the answers to the following 

1. What are the sets of permits and from whom we need before coffee can be allowed to leave the port of Brazil 

2. The paper work required for setting up a company in Brazil 

3. All the steps that exist from farm to table in the coffee supply chain

All these are very convenient. The prior process for me when attempting to break into a new domain was reaching out to various folks to get information. The insights usually come in a piecemeal manner and  is very time consuming process. 

The net new contribution in this case is figuring out how blockchain and smart contracts could be applied to the supply chain in a manner that humans will find receptive. This is something the AI will at most just be able to provide some suggestions but can’t really answer since it doesn’t have the data yet and the correct answer lies in the taste and preferences of the participants along the supply chain.

‎[4/25/23, 5:12:46 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/25/23, 5:21:30 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, a DAO is also subjected to the design thinking process. 

During the divergence phase (the scale), we should err on being as liberal as possible by allowing as many variants as possible in terms of human interaction dynamic to surface within the ecosystem. This will also quickly allow us to decipher and examine what the second order implications are when such dynamics are allows to play out unhindered 

During the convergence phase (the sword), depending on the purpose and core values of the DAO, policies should be introduced to keep in check all indentified dynamics that have been identified as having undesirable second order effects. 

The side-effect is that the depart of participants who persist in dynamics that are counter productive will have their departure hastened by such policies.

This is overall a positive phenomena for existing participants within the network 

While preparing for my keynote in Germany, I will also spend sometime drafting a white paper specific to our DAO which indicates all the policies and processes that are already in place and some of those that will be put in place. 🙂👍

I propose to just close out this poll. 

I will forward him the outcome of this poll just so he knows he is being liked by some here or depending on how it gets interpreted, on the receiving end of potential disruptions to his autonomy. 🤔

[4/26/23, 12:22:51 AM] Gary Teh: @6590995199 What are your personal thoughts about these videos which motived you to post them?
[4/26/23, 12:57:27 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking since we are a DAO with a well-defined purpose, with integrity as one of our core values and we are mainly comprised of professionals contributing based on our strengths, it is important our processes get structured to upkeep our core values of integrity. 

In that regard it makes total sense to give very clear and honest feedback when you observe the standard of a fellow member’s attempted contribution as being below the bar. 

This will upkeep the overall standard of work done within this DAO. 

 I would even go so far as to propose, governance token grants be withheld until attempted contribution to the DAO is of a satisfactory standard. 

Do note that it is important to differentiate between quality of execution (something with our control) versus outcome (something that is out of our control) 

A good example is defining a clear and coherent strategy that could be clearly understood by all members and then executed. 

The strategy might fail even when it is perfectly executed due to external reasons (market shifted, political climate shifted) 

Standard in this case refers to how clearly defined and coherent the strategy. 

Thoughts?
[4/26/23, 3:59:51 AM] Arie Ben David: Thank U Gary, these are very important issues that will determine our success in the long run. Short cuts now will lead to many challenges.

[4/26/23, 9:24:08 AM] Gary Teh: One thing became very clear to me these past few days floating down the Amazon river. when you strip away the entire fake news component that catalyzed the start of TrueSight DAO, at the very core of it are these 2 hypothesis: 

1. it is possible to cross pollinate the ethos of open source software movement into domains other than tech. A decentralized organization ran based purely on meritocracy. If you code sucks it never makes it into the main branch. However, you will always have the opportunity to aspire towards a high standard in your work.

2. Use of tokenization models will solve the problem inherent in open source software models where economic value is not duely accrued to contributors but instead accrued to plagiarist who unethically utilize the outputs to generate economic yield for themselves privately. A common term of this in the Web3 space is called vampire attacks  



Microsoft plagiarize a lot of software code from the Linux kernel when they were building their operating system. Microsoft has a market cap of 2.2 trillion dollars today 

The Linux operating system is an outcome of the open source software movement. 96.3% of the world’s top web servers are ran on it. 

None of Microsoft’s USD2.22 trillion are accrued to the open source developers whose code have been utilized by the Microsoft software development team. And neither are the values generated by the companies utilizing their servers being accrued to the Linux software development community.

Fake news is just one verticals where we attempt to prove these two hypothesis. 

Our choice of verticals ties back to our DAO’s purpose which is to build a better world based on verifiable truth.

[4/26/23, 11:05:53 AM] Gary Teh: When I was in serbia with @41799155602 last year, I had the opportunity to drink coffee with a bunch random folks 

Their worldview is vastly different from what is the norm out in the US. 

If you simply skimmed through the headlines of all the Chinese media outlets their perspective is also vastly different from western media 

Yesterday at the airport, an interesting episode happened

I was having a logistic discussion with Hiro, this old American dude just butt in uninvited with this comment. “You Asians surprisingly speak good English”

He might have meant it as a compliment but it just came across as totally rude and racist. 

Rude because he did not wait for his turn to speak as is the norm in Asia 

Racist for assuming only folks in the west speak good English. 

Being oblivious to faux pas he committed during the initial engagement he promptly went on to ask about Singapore’s stance on China and USA. 

Hiro being Japanese kept his though to himself. 

Me being really annoyed with his unwelcomed intrusion, proceeded to conducting a summary execution of him verbally 

“dude the world has already moved, US no longer generates more than 50% of the world’s gdp. 

No one especially trading partners to China really gives a shit about US at this point. 

This unconscious American hubris of yours is only going to get you into a lot of trouble. Might want to drop that. “

[4/26/23, 11:08:53 AM] Gary Teh: Actually if it’s based on facts, it’s news 

There are two components to news, the facts and the narrative 

The facts might be the same but a vastly different narrative could still be layered on top of the facts to help readers to interpret and comprehend these facts
[4/26/23, 11:09:59 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Had the opportunity to give a keynote about our DAO’s meta game when I was in Belgrad last year 

https://youtu.be/fPTJpRdkGC0

Here is the recording
[4/26/23, 11:19:29 AM] Gary Teh: Folks might be wondering why we are having a lot more polls lately. 

As I have mentioned before citing the example of the phenomena observed in Fatima’s university classes

These polls are meant to elicit our collective morality on specific areas in our DAO’s operations. 

The outcomes of these polls will be recorded as part of our DAO’s constitution within our White paper as policies in effect.
[4/26/23, 11:27:19 AM] Tess walkowski: When I went to write about chocolate I found some fake news.
[4/26/23, 11:29:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Stuff is messy.    Like they would write "started the first chocolate factory". When it was not the first factory.
[4/26/23, 11:29:46 AM] Tess walkowski: And ai lies
[4/26/23, 11:30:07 AM] Tess walkowski: Because it's referencing weird stuff

[4/26/23, 9:58:08 PM] Gary Teh: Spent the bulk of today working on a draft of our DAO’s white paper. 

The more details I recall from what I observed in our DAO over these past two years and place within the pages, the more apparent it becomes that our DAO’s ecosystem caters to a very specific audience. It is almost to such an extend, in the event of a profile mismatch the prospect shouldn’t even be in these channels.

The total addressable audience for our DAO is definitely not the whole but the good thing, the profile of who we should invite in our DAO becomes more apparent with this exercise

[4/26/23, 10:17:56 PM] Gary Teh: What is their background?
[4/26/23, 10:18:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: These are actual representatives of countries speaking in an official EU conference
[4/26/23, 10:18:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am quoting videos from OFFICIAL sources. Just not distorted or omitted by mainstream media cos the usa is trying to bury truths
[4/26/23, 10:21:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: I travel around the world for work. And when u step into places like San Francisco. 

U watch the number of homeless on the streets

U see target goods all locked up in cases

U see laws in California which enables people to stroll into stores. Take anything below a certain amounts and walk out because according to the law it’s not a felony and hence even guards do not care
[4/26/23, 10:23:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: I see constant reports of people strolling into schools shooting down children in the usa. 

I read of people having bankrupt by hospital bills and the government chooses to spend billions on weapons for Ukraine. 

But at the same time ignores wars in Yemen where people are dying also from war but usa doesn’t lift a finger to help
[4/26/23, 10:24:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: I fly to JFK. The best city in usa. And the airport is so old. So run down. So pitiful. Have u seen the Beijing airport? It’s almost like a 5 star hotel versus a motel
[4/26/23, 10:25:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: U have people walking on the streets giving crazy talk. But look At Amsterdam where drugs is legal. But there isn’t crazy people roaming on the streets.
[4/26/23, 10:26:43 PM] Kelvin Chew: We have people quarrelling over what a woman is. Which ironically is making a mockery of the nobility of the female race. Men invading the domains and privileges of women hood. Taking what they have in the guise of fluid genders. And the women are actually assisting them?
[4/26/23, 10:27:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: All these nonsense. Is absent or close being absent in the east.
[4/26/23, 10:27:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: If freedom of the west looks like the above. I think the east’s accused of lack of freedom is much better
[4/26/23, 10:28:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: I grew up with the impression of usa being the hero of the world. I admired it as a child. Trusting that usa will save the world and in trouble. We should just look at usa to find solutions
[4/26/23, 10:29:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: I do not think usa is such an entity anymore. The usa today has made a mockery of whatever achievements they once made. It is extremely sad to see your hero fall this way.

let’s switch context, from your perspective what is actionable out of this from an economic/financial standpoint? 

Otherwise we are just looking at the past and not really focused on figuring out what our next viable step is from the perspective of our DAO 🙂👍
[4/26/23, 10:42:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: Concentrate on finding money from the east. Not from the west.

[4/26/23, 10:51:06 PM] Gary Teh: Good point, since China has banned cryptocurrency altogether that really leaves only Dubai which is right now the worlds largest crypto hub 

I wouldn’t even bother raising fiat in US as that will immediately get us entangled with the SEC
[4/26/23, 10:51:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: Huh. U buy a stock when it’s low
[4/26/23, 10:52:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: U don’t buy high sell low
[4/26/23, 10:52:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: If an empire shift is in progress. The most profit is in the growth stage
[4/26/23, 10:53:29 PM] Gary Teh: You mean investing in Asian stocks.

[4/27/23, 6:02:16 AM] Gary Teh: Thanks for sharing! I been to Vienna myself. The city has a very beautiful and classical vibe to it 🙂
[8/14/23, 9:13:46 PM] Gary Teh: @14152693276 has been doing some RnD using chocolate as well this evening. 

Will pop by tomorrow to sample what was made. It looked really delicious in the photo 🙂

I am starting to sense as what I observed with @13104674556 @13134136108 and then myself, @16468233438 and @5511982667030 separately. 

The experience is not just about the consumption but also extends to the DIY RnD phase

It’s beyond food at this point, it’s crossing into the arts and craft section under the hobby category. My hunch is the creator enters into a FLOW state during this iterative process of creation. It’s almost therapeutic. 

I observe the creator profile also feels as sense of pride when the finally reveals the creation to the audience. 

And the shared consumption of the creation beyond that point almost feels like a celebration, a ritualized  consumption of sorts. 

I am starting to understand what @13134136108 meant when she mentioned the cacao ceremony can manifest in any form. 🙂

[8/14/23, 10:41:30 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking further about the idea of videos and communal celebrations

Reminds me of this documentary I made last year when I was invited to attend my friend’s master class in Fremont here in the Bay Area

He regularly goes around the Pacific Northwest teaching people how to forage and prepare food using foraged ingredients 

I wonder how receptive folks would be attending a monthly meetup in their local neighborhood where one of their own guides them in the form of a workshop on how to turn cacao nibs into chocolate bars 

https://youtu.be/rmulfscDVNU
[4/27/23, 10:45:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Hurt my foot. Found a bamboo stick. Hiked down. Power outages today from fallen trees.
[8/14/23, 10:53:15 PM] Gary Teh: Further extending on this what if we went about visiting, sampling and performing FSVP on those small scale farmers yet exporting to the USA across the entire Amazon region and then started bringing in their cacao nibs online into our Agroverse direct distribution network 

It definitely sounds like a very “nomadic” thing to do 🤣
[4/27/23, 10:49:11 AM] Tess walkowski: I want to read up on that now.
[8/14/23, 10:56:00 PM] Tess walkowski: We do camps and schools and workshops.
[4/27/23, 10:50:32 AM] Tess walkowski: Well china is smart, I know fruits export to there.   Soursap/gunabana is an example.   It's a luxury fruit. $40 lb usa
[8/14/23, 10:56:36 PM] Tess walkowski: Composting. Fermenting. Foraging.
[4/27/23, 10:51:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Sorry to the USA citizens that small scale trade can't be done but it can to china....
[8/14/23, 10:59:48 PM] Tess walkowski: We had a long discussion last night about the black Panthers
[4/27/23, 10:51:23 AM] Tess walkowski: China gets better produce
[8/14/23, 11:00:25 PM] Tess walkowski: One think people don't think about is that they provided food.
[4/27/23, 11:15:28 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that became fully apparent after reading these two books is that the one key thing that China did right the countries in Africa and Latin America failed to do is it went full steam ahead on building out its own manufacturing sector while the bulk of Latin America and Africa just mainly relied on exporting raw materials and importing manufactured goods. 

Import of raw materials and sales of Manufactured goods is where the bulk of the generated value is captured by countries 

In fact, this was the same strategy that the Asian tigers pursued during their rapid growth phase, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan
[8/14/23, 11:01:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Living in a dense area now in the north it's not like Cali or Florida where the food is cheap and nice

[4/27/23, 5:32:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Barefoot with a cane. Loln
[8/15/23, 8:17:49 PM] Gary Teh: That is the model I have proposed for Hans martin to adopt in Switzerland
[4/27/23, 5:33:19 PM] Gary Teh: Very cool! 

Could you record videos of it?
[8/15/23, 8:23:29 PM] Tess walkowski: I think that's their export licence with the government, it would work properly only if a few farmers got together
[4/27/23, 5:34:05 PM] Tess walkowski: Of the tour? Yeah that's my plan photos and video of cacao

[8/15/23, 8:25:59 PM] Gary Teh: Have them organize as a cooperative and then we can deal with them

Not cost effective for us to deal with one farmer at a time 

Or what might be even more interesting would be for us to form the cooperative in Ecuador and recruit them to it
[4/27/23, 5:36:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Also looks like someone was using the burning method of farming late at night
[8/15/23, 8:27:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Or in some time when I raise money for cacao acres :)
[4/27/23, 5:38:08 PM] Gary Teh: You mean they are burning their farm to replenish the soil??
[8/15/23, 8:27:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Maybe there are different laws to trade with ecudor.
[4/27/23, 5:38:46 PM] Tess walkowski: Yeah they burn areas to clean it
[8/15/23, 8:27:43 PM] Tess walkowski: They are asking other friends if anyone has the licenses
[4/27/23, 5:39:12 PM] Gary Teh: Make sense so long as it does not accidentally turn into a major fire
[8/15/23, 8:28:39 PM] Tess walkowski: For example in Ghana no one is allowed to direct purchase beans..... They did an experiment with fair trade which pain more and made a lot of money
‎[4/27/23, 5:39:51 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/15/23, 8:29:04 PM] Tess walkowski: But it didn't really change who farmers sold to despite fair trade paying more
[4/27/23, 5:48:01 PM] Tess walkowski: The fries wow that's strange
[8/15/23, 8:30:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Each big chocolate company makes a unique flavor profile and has to make sure they can recreate it
[4/27/23, 5:48:13 PM] Tess walkowski: Lots of carbs!!!
[8/15/23, 8:32:44 PM] Gary Teh: So farmers made more money. Consumers spent the same. Manufacturers and retailers made less
[4/27/23, 5:54:59 PM] Gary Teh: I was surprised too 😱
[8/15/23, 9:22:27 PM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade costs more
[4/27/23, 6:04:55 PM] Tess walkowski: Usually Colombians do a good fried rice
[8/15/23, 9:22:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Farmers sold to whoever came first

[8/15/23, 9:25:14 PM] Tess walkowski: And that's Ghana. I pay way more for actual farm produce here.
[4/27/23, 6:08:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: 📉USD
[8/15/23, 9:27:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade chocolate is usually like fifty cents more.
[4/27/23, 6:08:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Global deleveraging
[8/15/23, 9:29:07 PM] Tess walkowski: Most farming we eat it plantations the cacao etc.    All our grocery fruit our organic berries etc.
[4/27/23, 6:13:04 PM] Gary Teh: What do you mean by this term?
[8/15/23, 9:31:12 PM] Tess walkowski: Small farmers in USA succeed by becoming the producers.    That's where there is more money. But this requires consumers to change.  Which they do.    Even if everyone shops in the grocery store, they still consume treats or habits based on ethics or diet or morals etc etc.
[4/27/23, 6:15:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: End of the global reserve currency is on the way
[8/15/23, 9:32:24 PM] Tess walkowski: In the old days before whole foods there were co ops
[4/27/23, 6:16:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: USD will eventually rapidly lose its value
[8/15/23, 9:32:45 PM] Tess walkowski: People had to join to purchase bulk super foods
[4/27/23, 6:17:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: And hence. Whatever funds we tag ourselves to real world currency should be diversified and not be 100% pegged to usd
[8/15/23, 9:47:49 PM] Gary Teh: So fair trade means farmers get paid more, manufacturers and retailers get paid the same and consumers end up paying more???
[4/27/23, 6:18:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: Or even allow usd to dominate. Because the petrodollar at its most matured phase
[8/15/23, 10:05:18 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 do you think that is fair?

[4/28/23, 3:54:33 AM] Gary Teh: Who is that??
[8/16/23, 6:50:38 AM] Tess walkowski: We are dealing with monoculture and multinational companies, though I think the food in Cali and Florida is more diverse.
[4/28/23, 4:19:01 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: He's a friend from LinkedIn
[8/16/23, 6:52:45 AM] Tess walkowski: I think most artisanal coffee is fair trade.
[4/28/23, 4:19:18 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: If you wanna see some dance moves check this out 😂
[8/16/23, 6:53:31 AM] Tess walkowski: I pay significantly more for food from an actual farmer and gladly.    That's different than fair trade that's local.

Will present this in Germany. 🤩
[8/16/23, 1:50:38 PM] Tess walkowski: I think it's gonna be $5
[4/28/23, 8:01:53 PM] Gary Teh: Not only cacao, the interfacing will be so clean that it can support any and all agricultural goods type from all small scale marginalized farmers once we get the whole legal and logistics plumbing setup

From my perspective, Uber was not able to enforce their policy on what happens offline even though the match making was done via their network

We will face the same enforcement problem as well for whatever blockchain solution we come up. The only way to really do this is for us to own the entire end to end infrastructure. 

Imagine if the driver was driving a car provided by Uber and tried to do something funny like this. 

One user complain and the network freezes his entire car not allowing him to drive

That should be how networks enforce their policies

I am aware both of you have questions about blockchain and web3 related stuff 

I have been receiving your DMs

I observed a lot of the questions I have been getting lately are somewhat recurring

Maybe we should just set a time to organize a AMA on LinkedIn 

Where anyone can participate by either asking whatever Web3 related questions you might have or simply chime by suggesting solutions you might employed successfully under such circumstances 

I believe it’s more effective use of time 

Please feel free to schedule the session and I will pop by 

As @918017107841 personally experienced recently, it took me more than a week to respond to her questions she sent via DM. 

@5491125130580 I know you have a whole bunch of questions for me so I believe it will not just personally benefit you but everyone else as well to have these questions answered

   - git might be a more suitable solution for traceability 

   - blockchain might be a more suitable solution for tracking the flow of funds to support future ESG funding initiatives using profits generated

[8/22/23, 6:33:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Like can you get raw unfermented?  Can you get organic fair trade cacao powder to Australia?
[4/30/23, 7:39:09 PM] Gary Teh: Yes it was. One thing that is coming through strong. Faith in god is a very core part of Latin American psychology
[8/22/23, 7:04:19 PM] Gary Teh: Should be possible. If they already know how to handle the importing paperwork on their side

[4/30/23, 8:09:55 PM] Gary Teh: They pierced the kambo right into your skin?? 😱
[8/22/23, 10:00:59 PM] Gary Teh: Love the idea you brought to @16468233438 about donating part of the profit proceeds to carbon offsets 

What I actually found even more intriguing was when meshing up  your idea with the one that @554888644380 surfaced earlier in the year 

Why stop there?

Cabruca cacao farmers plant trees i the jungle anyways 

We do know that carbon credits are issued when trees are planted 

Instead of donating the proceeds for carbon offsets, why not donate the proceeds to help these farmers plant even more cacao trees and in the process get carbon credits issued 

We can sell off these carbon credits to companies that need these carbon credits for their day to day operations
[4/30/23, 8:10:13 PM] Gary Teh: What does it mean??
[8/22/23, 10:03:14 PM] Gary Teh: Please do introduce yourself to the rest of community

Seems like he is hinting at the following types of hard currency

Cacao backed coins
Gold backed coins
Land backed coins 
Energy backed coins
Military backed coins

Anything that is tied directly to physical resources that have direct utilization purpose and not fiat which issuers could simply mint away their debts while devaluing the store of value that savers hope to utilize in the future

Figured to share some short clips here. 

I believe at some point, we should have enough to make a mini-documentary

Will go collect more clips during this upcoming visit to the Bahia region

[5/2/23, 8:07:32 PM] Gary Teh: Now that the required roles within the guilds are clearly defined, it becomes easier to onboard new prospective members who want to actively contribute their time, effort and network to the DAO

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper

https://truesight.me/dao/sunmint/whitepaper

I think for prospects that approach during the upcoming cryptorockstar cruise conference that only want to invest money for returns, the response becomes very clean and simple, just buy the NFTs issued by the various guilds when they become available. Since these NFTs are structured specifically for that purpose.

[8/27/23, 9:58:22 AM] Gary Teh: I was giving some further thoughts about this

*The conclusion about what Agroverse is*
Agroverse is not the low cost provider of cacao nibs for people who simply want to drink cacao and will further perpetuate the social hardship and environmental destruction purely for the purpose of profitability 

Agroverse is a simple no brainer daily experience that anyone can engage in if they see themselves as deeply spiritual person with profound love for our humanity and natural environment. 

Someone who because of this profound love wants to do their part to save our Amazon forest and reverse climate change. 

It just so happens that we are engaged in drinking carefully sourced cacao as part of our efforts
[5/3/23, 6:17:47 PM] Gary Teh: How many shamans have you interacted with?
[8/27/23, 10:02:51 AM] Gary Teh: So from this perspective a consumer that is just purely looking at price and has no love for our fellow humanity and our natural environment is not our target customer
[5/3/23, 6:26:04 PM] Gary Teh: You know most of the time when I share the lessons from our RnD in this meta game of ours I only have time to share the parts that worked or are currently being tested. 

Bulk of the 95% that were tested and failed were not shared just simply due to a lack of presentation bandwidth available. 

The conversation would be more interesting if we had time to dig into the failed carcasses to explore the whys.
[8/27/23, 10:05:31 AM] Tess walkowski: Even on this website there is a major difference between those prices one is $4 one is $8
[5/3/23, 7:00:10 PM] Tess walkowski: A lot
[8/27/23, 10:06:12 AM] Tess walkowski: This site is b2b and requires minimum purchase
[5/3/23, 7:00:17 PM] Tess walkowski: I am a student
[8/27/23, 10:46:32 AM] Gary Teh: What is the minimum purchase??
[5/3/23, 7:00:44 PM] Tess walkowski: There are different words though. Shamans not the right word.
[8/27/23, 10:47:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Starts at $100
[5/3/23, 7:00:54 PM] Tess walkowski: I use mamo / taita
[8/27/23, 10:47:24 AM] Tess walkowski: They have criolla I would try
[5/3/23, 7:01:41 PM] Tess walkowski: "shaman" it's a big word, those who would be that are spirit walkers and are wow
[8/27/23, 10:47:44 AM] Tess walkowski: Not much
[5/3/23, 7:01:57 PM] Tess walkowski: Mamo
[8/27/23, 10:48:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Personally I would choose to pay more when it's ethical.
[5/3/23, 7:02:27 PM] Tess walkowski: Is the name of the spiritual healer of the kogi , shaman level yes
[8/27/23, 10:48:49 AM] Tess walkowski: I would want to find the best not the cheapest
[5/3/23, 7:05:19 PM] Tess walkowski: I interact with many people in healing and medicine circles ....many who use word shaman are not, I am not a shaman, I am a student but it's based on my spirituality, though it is western issues which led me to what I do now, I lost someone close to cancer.
[8/27/23, 10:50:05 AM] Tess walkowski: We probably need to have it here in USA at under $10 a kilo cleared I think ?
[5/3/23, 7:05:42 PM] Tess walkowski: I need to write a medium article "what is a shaman"
[8/27/23, 10:50:58 AM] Tess walkowski: I pay a lot for my criolla.
[5/3/23, 7:07:48 PM] Tess walkowski: I am connected with healers in puto mayo, here, USA.   But farming / Buddhist practice / respect of nature .  Meditation and food are the basis of what I practice.   And so like the earth gives us all this how magic.
[8/27/23, 10:51:38 AM] Tess walkowski: It's not "ceremonial" if I don't have the right stuff
[5/3/23, 7:08:29 PM] Tess walkowski: There is a wild world out there: shamans go there
[8/27/23, 10:55:19 AM] Tess walkowski: B2B ethical criolla ceremonially fair trade, sure it's fine to even pay the initial trade more up to $22 a kilo   shipping customs will add another $8-15
[5/3/23, 7:52:00 PM] Tess walkowski: But if anyone needs, yes I do know safe and vetted healers and shamans all through this area and the USA and Sarah can also guide in her area and I can in Michigan with psylocybin.     Most people I would work with, also cost waaaaay less than a 10 g retreat and is safer though not as western.

[5/3/23, 7:53:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Many of the people I want to study with next are in Brazil.....that's the kambo healers and the hapeh makers and they want to connect with us all.
[8/27/23, 9:57:29 PM] Tess walkowski: This model is similar to how maybe I personally would want to approach or develop.
[5/3/23, 7:53:57 PM] Tess walkowski: They are also far away Amazon and their land is getting blown out for you guessed it....mono culture
[8/27/23, 9:59:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Their nibs are expensive they offer both nibs and cacao
[5/3/23, 7:54:24 PM] Tess walkowski: And so yeah cacao for me is a way to empower indigenous and it's a high value crop

[8/28/23, 8:30:32 PM] Anupa/diya: Carbonbase is very proud to announce partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to Launch Asia's First Digital Carbon Registry.
Carbonbase, a climate-tech and carbon reduction solutions provider, is excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to launch Global Climate Registry (GCR), Asia’s first digital native Carbon Registry.

"Our previous work in supporting climate solutions' adoption in APAC naturally drove us to find new ways to inspire and aid climate action" Max Song CEO of Carbonbase noted.

"We believe in a future where the balance sheet of our planet lives on a public ledger. It is critical that standards and methodologies are governed and operated in a publicly auditable manner that is easy for project developers to adopt." said Wes Geisenberger, Vice President of Sustainability & ESG at The HBAR Foundation.

"GCR represents a pivotal milestone in the intersection of climate change, digital green finance and blockchain technology" said Katherine Foster, Executive Director Green Digital Finance Alliance & Former Canadian Climate Diplomat.

Blockchain can significantly improve the current bottlenecks of current carbon registries and increase transparency, accountability and traceability of greenhouse gas emissions. It helps companies provide more accurate, reliable, standardised, and readily available data on carbon emissions.

This decentralized approach allows for tracking and reporting of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions along the entire supply chain, including manufactures, suppliers, distributors and consumers.

[8/28/23, 10:22:31 PM] Gary Teh: Had the great opportunity to listen to Mike Jordan share his theory on statistical contract theory during the talk this Sunday in Berkeley University. 

https://www.amazon.science/blog/icassp-michael-i-jordans-alternative-view-on-ai

The framework reminds me of how the number of tokens for each category of contribution is set in our rubric. 

How his theory applies to us is that overtime as we collect more data for each category of contribution on our ledger we will be able to determine via statistics what the right amount of governance token should be. 

Have a read of his paper if you are keen.
[5/5/23, 4:29:44 PM] Gary Teh: Namaste brother! 🤩🙏
[8/28/23, 10:42:27 PM] Gary Teh: If we ever get to the point one day of training an AI to automatically grade an incoming contribution based on our rubric and then automatically adjust the value of governance tokens associated with a line item of our rubric then we would have basically implemented the theoretical framework he posits in practice

[5/5/23, 10:49:53 PM] Gary Teh: Started discussions with Faraj who runs the crypto executives group, a community comprising of more than 2000 CEOs and executives from L1 and L2 protocols yesterday. 

They are keen to adopt this same set of tokenomics extensions that we are right now experimenting with rolling out in our DAO as well as in the house of balance 

The upside would be our DAO gains direct access to the CEOs of the L1 and L2 protocols whenever we need stuff sorted out on our end. 

Starting to notice I am mainly bumping into the same group of people who are circulating around Dubai, Belgrad and Germany within the crypto community 

Me and Faraj met almost one year ago back in Dubai at the HHH meetup me, @41799155602, @971564644817 and the rest of the folks in DAOversal organized at the DIFC. 

both of us only realized that when we brought out our telegram apps yesterday. 

It’s fascinating how opportunities for collaboration naturally arise and bring people together in this community.
[8/30/23, 10:04:13 AM] Tess walkowski: I need to learn from your minimalism how I can fit a cacao ceremony and myself in my truck.

[8/30/23, 10:05:07 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao was for the elite, but there was a merchant class who traveled with delicacies and drank much cacao
[5/6/23, 1:55:35 AM] Gary Teh: Was experimenting with using ChatGpt to classify WhatsApp messages reporting contributions made by DAO members. The outcome seems discrete enough to be utilized for programmatic interfacing  

This is a small step towards automating classification of contributions submitted by members using our rubric system

[5/9/23, 6:17:36 AM] Gary Teh: While I was having coffee with , he mentioned the digital meaning of the word “religion” means path to god. 

Amazing how its meaning end up defaulting to organized religion in the modern age
[8/31/23, 8:00:50 PM] Tess walkowski: "nothing" is not nothing
[5/9/23, 7:00:21 AM] Daniel - Blue Kraken: The roots of the word “religio” come from the Aramaic language and mean “back to God” or “back to One” or “re-unite to One”. 

So every “religion” that does not unite is not real religion. Every religion that separates is no real religion.
[8/31/23, 8:00:57 PM] Tess walkowski: Oh zen. Lol.

[8/31/23, 8:17:22 PM] Gary Teh: Everyday in the morning after you have finished brushing your teeth, the app will propose three verbs that you are already going to do anyway sometime during the day 

You will choose one out of the three proposed 

During the course of the day when you perform the verb, you will be required to be fully present when performing it for just 3 seconds  

Nothing else beyond that 

The choice of verb proposed for you will be surfaced based on your astrological natal chart that will most heighten your energy frequency for the day. It’s based on 五行 the five elements and the astrological research from the banaras spiritual institute of India
[5/9/23, 9:02:18 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : Interesting detail around the aramaic language, the language of jesus. In latin it comes from "relegare" (not sure if its written like this) what also means "the way to god".

There was this room mate who had the symbol of DAO tattooed on her arm. She mentioned she had a vision where Saint expedite gave instructions to come visit the borders. 

Saint expedite is the patron of urgent causes, merchants and navigators. 

And lo and behold We encountered his altar while we were walking to the bazaar.

[5/9/23, 2:16:21 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! I have been experimenting around just now with ChatGpt myself about potentially moving our entire ledger into Ethereum 

https://TrueSight.me/ledger

Prompted ChatGpt to come up with a smart contract that supports both notarization of member contributions as well as a simultaneous issue of governance tokens to the reporting contributor’s wallet

It came up with a really nice and clean code
‎[9/2/23, 7:49:15 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/9/23, 2:18:03 PM] Gary Teh: I think the next step is to just train ChatGpt to categorize all the reported contributions by members in exchange for governance tokens that are automatically granted based on the smart contract using both our rubric as well as the historical data that is already recorded on our ledger.

The 1% active contributor. 9% active participants. 90% passive observe rule is a recurring one 

I observed it when I was running growth for Edmodo. 

My ex-colleagues working in Facebook reported the same. 

Right now even the same is observed in TrueSight DAO

@918017107841 was agonizing over engagement a lot during our private FaceTime sessions

However since that total population of token holders are actually just 200++ people, anything more than 2 people being active within the DAO is actually considered healthy 🤩

[5/9/23, 5:48:33 PM] Tess walkowski: ## USE OF CACAO FOUND IN ECUADOR OVER 5000 YEARS AGO IN

Theobromine Cacao grows best within 10 degrees of the Equator.      Botanical records show that it originally grew in the Amazonian rainforest and along the Ortigo river basin which stretched along the border of Colombia and Venezuela..       It is a thirsty tree and thrives best under the canopy of taller trees, close to a robust water source.     

The earliest documented traces of Cacao was found inside clay pots in Santa Ana de Florida in Ecuador.    These remnants belonged to the Mayo-Chinchipe culture which resided in the highlands of Ecuador from 1500 to 1700 BC.  This dates the earliest documented discovery of cacao to over 5000 years ago.      Vessels found in Santa Ana de Florida contained residues of Theobromine.   Theobromine is the bitter compound that gives chocolate its potent flavor and kick.    Rich in minerals it is a nutrient-dense addition to the diet.    

   Archeologic research suggests that cacao was used both in the day to day life and during special rituals.     The records show plants and animals were domesticated at this time.    Researchers analyzed the genome of Ecuadorian cacao, and it showed a genome that implies it was cultivated due to less variety in the genome.      This indicated that the Mayo-chinchipe culture grew cacao domestically.    Prior to this discovery, the earliest documented use of cacao was in Mesoamerica.       After this discovery, it is possible to surmise that the Mayo-chinchipe may have been responsible for trading cacao with Mesoamerica.

I know that @436608133615 and @16265414957 are probably on their way to Belgrad for the tomorrow conference.
[9/3/23, 7:35:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Spread the word!
[5/10/23, 3:08:40 PM] Brian -IOM: The Chinese have an expression that is somewhat lost in translation: “a fish stinks from its head”. It basically means that the corporate culture is dictated by the CEO or c-suite. Microsoft was therefore a monopolistic, manipulative bastard of a company when Gates was in charge! But conversely, anyone who works at Tesla is driven by the bigger picture mission, which means it stiff competition!
[9/3/23, 7:37:28 PM] Anupa/diya: For each bag that is brought, we can also plant a tree
[5/10/23, 3:12:21 PM] Gary Teh: Elon Musk has two thesis

Figure out how to survive on earth (Tesla)

[9/4/23, 6:44:36 AM] Gary Teh: Pertaining to this current poll to implement the Kill Switch in our meta game 

Some of the historical *key reasons for common pool resources management failure*:

1. to define clearly what are the resources being managed

2. Clear accounting of how much resource is there

3. Not making the pain of management failure clear and in your face vivid.

It’s an oxymoron to be building a web3 game but not adopted a DAO enabled model that allows contributors (developers, designers, story tellers, marketeers…) to come join and co-create the game together

[5/10/23, 3:57:39 PM] Gary Teh: @4915209984105 and @491736386942 have created the Dmany social mining platform 

What I am hoping to happen for them is that projects using platform don’t just distribute their tokens in exchange for marketing 

That the tokens actually represent governance tokens in these projects 

A lot of the projects I came across have this two tier model 

Equity in the projects
Tokens that is not associated with ownership of the project

From a decentralized ethos perspective, this is just a scam of people’s time and efforts

He mentioned the same thing as @14806488258 

Creating our own insurance facility at some point that folks along the supply chain can purchase to insure shipment passing through our network

Coincidentally insurance is the business for parent company to social impact fund that  @14152693276 is at. 

@41799155602 also mentioned the floating of a futures sustainable commodity market. This seems to in line with the thinking of the cooperative folks in Bahia 

Seems the stars are slowly aligning themselves

[9/5/23, 8:07:44 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/11/23, 8:39:10 AM] Gary Teh: The connection between divinity and self-sovereignty lies in the belief that every individual has an inherent divine essence that gives them guidance to fulfill their unique purpose. Self-sovereignty is the practical expression of this inner divinity, allowing individuals to exercise their innate power and shape their own lives.

[9/7/23, 6:44:11 AM] Gary Teh: I finally bumped into a local that spoke English last night at one of the cafes. 

She explained the same hobo whom I bumped into again the second evening and showed me his knife… again… was in fact trying to rob me… both times in fact. 

He walked off the second time cursing and swearing. In hindsight it must have been a really frustrating experience for him for attempt at robbing someone and fail miserably because of communication breakdown 🤔

I would have imagined if I was a robber, I would have just took the knife and stabbed my target instead of showing it to him both two times as though I was trying to sell him the knife 🤷‍♂️

Next step looking into hardware specs and power needs. 

We could load more solar panels to the ones already installed if required 

80% of the mining cryptocurrency will be channeled back to Hans Martin to help off set rental cost

10% to the house of balance to start backing the value of the governance tokens they will be issuing

10% to our vault for helping manage the prototype machine remotely via SSH.

Different entities  working on the same exact thing in parallel un coordinated.

[5/12/23, 10:52:28 PM] Gary Teh: Tokenization becomes easier once you are able to estimate on how much produce a plot generates per year. 

Hans Martin came up with a really good suggestion last night while we were chatting. 

Instead of being ultra granular about tokenizing every single type of action in the green house. Come up with a set of guidelines that volunteers can follow once they arrive on the premise to offer service. Allow them to contribute as they would freely

Then the tokenization is focused on the presence of service offered by volunteers to the community.
[9/11/23, 8:12:20 AM] Gary Teh: I realize this is starting to feel like startup reality TV

Any failure we experience on our critical path will be publicly available for all to see during the episodes. 🤩

That would be useful. I was sharing with the guild members in EcoVerse21 that once we have successfully iterated on two shipments of supplies via the direct to consumer distribution network we are right now setting up we can start reaching out to more sources to pipe through our network 

The indigenous communities as well as the source surfaced by @447887692903 🙂

[5/13/23, 12:02:21 AM] Gary Teh: Shipment 1: cobranded with cacao supplier from Ecuador 

Shipment 2: white labeled from coop in Bahia Brazil
[9/12/23, 7:06:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Same thing on cacao? Keep hitting this firewall there is so much wild research
[5/13/23, 1:08:02 AM] Arie Ben David: Creating a Monetary Eco System that facilitates various contributions on the scale with various currencies can address these issues in balanced way:
Volunteering and free excess to all is one polar and payment partly with Fiat Money is the other polar.
In between play various currencies such as community  token that creates the growing value, resources and trust and a different currency that serves efficient operating market place that facilitates and rewards vital  resource exchange in various forms of contributions.

[5/13/23, 3:36:34 PM] Gary Teh: Was chatting with @41765737357 today. 

One key insight is that the following three paths  will naturally lead to the circular economy

1. Passion (as herself)
2. Ultra efficient engineering design 
3. Ultra high quality engineering 


I wonder if the decentralized managed supply chain we are setting up within the EcoVerse21 project right now if allowed to continuously evolve as how the DAO has been will eventually evolve to become circular too.
[9/12/23, 11:11:23 AM] Gary Teh: Kaka!! 🤣
[5/13/23, 3:43:32 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we may want to consider starting with a small nonprofit

[9/12/23, 1:30:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, this seems like more a vacation video and is not consistant to the  message.  looks more like a vacation than an attempt to help the farmers of Brazil
[5/13/23, 3:44:39 PM] Gary Teh: I think we should just validate the viability of the whole supply chain model first before sinking any further resources into building it out 🤔
[9/12/23, 1:40:47 PM] Suheil - Europe: no content is bad for social media, i can already see this type of videos fitiing perfectly the expression "work hard,play hard" :D
[5/13/23, 3:44:43 PM] Tess walkowski: Fruited with a fermentation
[9/12/23, 2:06:50 PM] Val Lapidus: I disagree. You muddy your message by having this type of content.  Maybe in the future once the proof of concept is established.  But right now just makes it seem amateur
[5/13/23, 3:45:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Our brands hero journey will emerge
[9/12/23, 2:07:59 PM] Val Lapidus: If I am learning about a brand and the fourth video is work hard. Play hard.  I'm sorry but we haven't worked hard enough to have the fourth video be the party hard video.  There's a time and a place.  Save this for later.  Should not be the fourth episode.

If it success than the par value of our tokens might jump to USD0.0099
[9/13/23, 4:36:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: it's not about blockchain, it is about building a proper "automated" ecosystem. by theory we know that as a tool blockchain is the most efficient to adopt efficient scalability. 

until now, everything has been worked on by small teams on heavily dependent on a couple of individuals ( just like in a traditional company). Which is completely normal for bootstrap and MVP If we are progressively targeting real decentralization .... other wise it would be just another project ran by some specific teams with a very obvious kill switch threat 🤷‍♂️ 

conclusion: blockchain is a TOOL that CAN help us build progressively into a DAO.
[5/13/23, 5:54:39 PM] Tess walkowski: With faith at our side we will not fail.
[9/13/23, 5:22:38 AM] Suheil - Europe: while we are talking about this i read : "“We have global clients looking to use these products and in some sense, almost not caring that it’s blockchain, right? They just want access to this new feature.”" from big boss at JP Morgan

[5/14/23, 8:48:22 AM] Gary Teh: From the perspective of the two projects our guilds are building, we are potentially looking at fundraising via the sales of NFTs which come with very specific utilities associated with those projects once we have tested the initial prototype and are ready to take in additional fundings to scale up those projects 

Since it’s fundraising via NFTs, opensea has the most liquidity so we might end up opting for that route

[5/14/23, 9:51:46 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: many people understand circular economy as a kind of waste management. however, the goal must be to design new products in such a way that they never become waste. for example, that only healthy and degradable materials or materials that can be kept free of toxins in the technical cycle are used. humans and their creation are at the centre of this. in this way, we can organise our economic activity and our consumption in the same way as all animals on this planet do. In harmony with nature.

[5/15/23, 1:28:34 AM] Gary Teh: I wonder if there might be a Darwinian evolutionary aspects to this from a risk management perspective 

Route 1: The whole extended family putting their eggs in one basket, if it fails, the entire family gets wiped out

Route 2: The individuals within the family go in separate directions, if one member fails, he is dispensable and experiences biological death. Other members discover something viable and the rest of the tribe (less one dead member) prospers. Or perhaps the whole tribe gets wiped out and the one survivor who discovers something viable continues the gene pool

Bulk of the modern day Singaporean Chinese are descendents of migrants who opted to up and leave their ancestral land at some point (route 2) during to civil war during the Qing dynasty

[5/15/23, 3:03:04 AM] Gary Teh: I observe factions within an organization tends to form once a “correct” way of doing things (culture) has crystallized within a sub-set of participants. 

Inter faction conflict starts intensifying when the competing culture attempt to dictate on the “correct” way of doing things

There was a business case study about the Port Authority of Singapore in the 90s when they decided to modernize/digitize which I came across back in the university 

The government issued the mandate to digitize. The head of departments (HODs) at first resisted. After a period of small scale trial testing and scaling within selected departments, The executive team finally gave the HODs the notice to either transit or get replaced. (Their way of removing factions)

As a source of psychological comfort the HODs were for a while running parallel systems. Printing documents off the system which had zero value whatever so to the overall process 

Ultimately, the transition was successfully completed. Sea freight turn around time at the port dropped from 5 days to 30 minutes

[5/15/23, 2:50:55 PM] Alessandro Mele: We have been working with an external partner so there is a fee sharing arrangement. We have also done some consulting work to support with business model and investor deck. Our consulting fees are paid part up front and part upon fund raising for a total of £25k. We also help with investor introductions and that is paid 6% on capital raised. Finally we have a legal provision that allows us to convert part of the success fees in shares of the company either at this round or the next.
[9/21/23, 2:59:00 PM] Val Lapidus: did we find someone to convert the MiniDVs?  Walgreens used to do this for a fee

[9/21/23, 3:24:14 PM] Val Lapidus: It's 40 per tape and takes a month
[5/15/23, 3:20:20 PM] Alessandro Mele: We have in the past raised all of the raise or a portion from our investor network, other times we have not been successful - for instance for a clean tech start up we are struggling as they are pre-revenue, capital intensive and their technology is disrupting the renewable energy market so most investors are staying away. So we need to be creative and persistent in looking for potential investors who can take these risks
[9/21/23, 3:27:02 PM] Gary Teh: Should be. Let’s wait for @41765737357 to confirm

[9/22/23, 2:29:28 AM] Gary Teh: Understood from the cooperative they right now are exploring issuing cacao coins to their farmers in exchange for taking their cacao inventory 

Once Agroverse prove we can sell off their inventory in the USA market, I think we might be able to propose to the cooperative to a deeper partnership. to send us their inventory on consignment (we don’t pay for it)

The way I envision it working is that in this scenario:

    - the farmers themselves become the financiers of the inventory 

    - our DAO finances the freighting cost to USA which we will then deduct from the *gross profit* 

    - our DAO finances the packaging cost which we will then recoup from the *gross profit* 

    - from the *net profit* , DAO charge the standard rate (19%) to back the value of our governance tokens 

     - of the *net profit* the rest (81%) all goes back to the farmers for financing the inventory. They get a really good price 
    
    - we retool Edgar (our AI) to monitor USA online markets to identify *consumer market arbitrage opportunities* for the farmers products 

    - farmers and DAO can utilize Edgar’s report to decide which USA consumer market opportunity to bet on. This will be possible because we have full visibility of all the cost components along the entire supply chain 

    - farmer bears cost for inventory. DAO bears cost for freighting. Both have enough skin in the game to want the outcome to be positive 

    - the cooperative self regulates the cost price of the inventory. If they price it too high, the USA consumer will not buy. DAO will not want to take shipment 

    - cooperative members contributing to help build out the network can vote on standard rate too. 

All interest are aligned, we end up with a self balancing system. No need to haggle over price between supplier and distributor 🤩

[9/23/23, 6:44:21 PM] Gary Teh: Beginning to get a sense of what business development after being first introduced to this subject two years ago by @6598383264 and then observing @41799155602 in action up close on how it’s conducted 

If our projects are software, it’s Basically an iterative hacking process which involves modifying its API interface to integrate with external third party service provider or fitting into external third service consumer while keeping a residue of the resource that flows through the pipeline 🤩
[5/15/23, 6:39:30 PM] Tess walkowski: Which my video notes showb
[9/23/23, 6:56:16 PM] Gary Teh: The primary difference between software development and business development I observe is that 

During the hacking process, when software receives “junk” inputs, they will either throw well formed exception messages or simply crash 

With business development, since we are technically “hacking” humans, subjects either get really annoyed, frustrated or just simply stop responding when fed with “junk” inputs 

“White box” based testing methods to figure out what works and what not tends to be more challenging to deploy as a hacking approach in business development 🤔

[5/18/23, 2:58:59 PM] Gary Teh: I am starting to notice over the course of the past two weeks. 

The deliberate streamlining of guild membership size within our DAO based around the two pizza team rule has the counter intuitive effect of boosting execution effectiveness

By sticking to the two pizza rule and then applying the additional rule that Fara utilized to up keep the quality of his community (removing systematically disinviting the least relevant member whenever a new one seeks to join), people remaining in the guild chatrooms know very clearly why they are still there and how they are supposed to contribute.
Distractions and confusion are this minimalized.
[9/26/23, 5:32:48 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a study on how much carbon is consumed by plants for photosynthesis per year and how much carbon is already being generated by all living organisms will be really helpful

[9/26/23, 6:02:24 AM] Dr. Denis: I am pretty serious about climate change, fake "green energy" and "CO2 damaging the environment" fraud propagated by mass-media, UN bodies and politicians. It has nothing to do with real science. I've been doing my own research in this area for 20+ years (up to PhD level) and I am happy that the laureate of Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 Dr. John Clauser confirmed that I was right https://youtu.be/TGrMvlxEQGk
[5/19/23, 10:23:21 AM] Tess walkowski: If we expand this could be fun bc there could be more guilds.
[9/26/23, 6:07:45 AM] Dr. Denis: There is a tight "Energy-Water-Food" nexus. It's not possible to solve one problem while ignoring & exacerbating other problems. Dutch farmers pump CO2 into greenhouses to increase their yields. CO2 is the food for plants and the source of life on Planet Earth. Capturing CO2 from coal power plants and/or buying fake voluntary carbon offset is non-sense. As a supporter of Agroverse DAO I am sharing here my thoughts and I am eager to contribute my academic & practical knowledge
[5/19/23, 10:24:39 AM] Tess walkowski: As we expand too core values should drive.
[9/26/23, 6:14:10 AM] Gary Teh: So can we do the reverse?

When farmers pump CO2 into their farm we issue carbon credits??
[5/19/23, 10:27:59 AM] Gary Teh: It is quite similar to the advice @14806488258 always gave when we were on the hiring committee together in the previous company. "Always seek to bring onboard a new colleague whom you feel you will be happy to give up your current job position for"

In this case, we turned it into a rule and systematically apply it in our DAO.
[9/26/23, 6:28:33 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes i know one of the scammers (llike noot personally but of his existence) and he lives well protected iin one of the most expensive penthouuses in tel aviv 🙂
[5/19/23, 10:30:41 AM] Tess walkowski: As a small business owner it checks out too
[9/26/23, 6:29:26 AM] Suheil - Europe: i can expose to you even eaasier, the scam forex system . iin my home town in nazareth 19 years olf kids drive ferraris and telll you they work as brokers…. in forex scams hhh
[5/19/23, 10:31:37 AM] Tess walkowski: Also who wants to do the same job all the time? Haha there are many positions
[9/26/23, 6:55:26 AM] Dr. Denis: My suggestion is to simply drop this carbon credits idea because it's anti-human ecocidal scam which is being gradually exposed in various publications
[5/19/23, 1:28:13 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we could tag in / tag out

[5/20/23, 12:41:34 AM] Gary Teh: Just chanced upon a very beautiful crowd sourcing model like the ones we have been experimenting with within our various guilds  

The monetization model is very clear and apparent too. Contributors snap photos of broken man holes. Utility companies pay for the data so that they can send their guys to fix these man holes.

[5/20/23, 12:44:06 AM] Gary Teh: My sense is such types of model is going become more prevalent now that it is finally featured on Bloomberg
[9/26/23, 7:36:44 AM] Tess walkowski: I also think we could find distribution channels via smaller companies.   I found a few companies that carry nibs.  Approach them directly?

[5/22/23, 3:07:44 AM] Gary Teh: Do you think it might make sense to first have a roadmap and the roles we need at various stages of the roadmap? 

That way, when we engages with these folks they will know clearly where they fit in in the grander scheme of things as well as how they will be expected to contribute? And most importantly their ability and willingness to contribute within that defined scope

Based on what we observed last one and a half year, inviting folks into our DAO without providing them a clear view of how they are expected to contribute immediately just leaves them hanging and disengaged. 

In some cases when the values and vision are clearly not aligned, we observed clearly disruptive behaviors exhibited by these participants in our DAO 🙂

[5/22/23, 3:37:37 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that becomes very apparent after looking back at historical data recorded on our ledger as well as memories of conversations we had with prospective contributors, is that moment of “spark” where there is light in their eyes

From my perspective this translates to

“This DAO’s purpose, mission and core values deeply resonates with who I am (my identity). I have basically found my tribe and I am going to contribute towards its mission so as to actualize its vision.”

From that point onwards contributing time and effort in exchange for governance tokens (thus voting rights) in our DAO just becomes as natural as breathing air 

The follow up tell tale sign of whether we are speaking to a missionary or a mercenary is if the prospect we are speaking with is going to ask for fiat. If they do, then they clearly fall under the mercenary category. We can circle back to them at a later date but we should prioritize our time in finding other missionaries for our DAO 🙂🙏

The channel is here

[9/30/23, 6:59:38 PM] Jonathan: This sounds like a nice value add or maybe at an event with a little time for you to talk about the DAO behind it. The key would be able to make it easy to order if people enjoyed them. Really easy to order.
[5/24/23, 7:03:58 AM] Alessandro Mele: 👍🙌🤙
[9/30/23, 7:14:42 PM] Gary Teh: Venmo where we can accept payment right now for the inventory we have on display

If we run out then QR code where they could just order on our website  

Natural complement to the events organized by OffChain since I observe most of the events cater food as well 

We can be one of the mini-caterers

[9/30/23, 7:16:35 PM] Jonathan: Sounds like it has some legs.. especially if you can get the story out which will probably give web3 people a bit more incentive to buy
‎[5/25/23, 9:40:51 AM] Gary Teh: ‎audio omitted
[9/30/23, 11:17:54 PM] Gary Teh: I think the important thing is recurring buying behavior like a subscription model

What might be interesting would be to serve one cacao derivative (brownie, ceremonial cacao drink…) during a meetup and then have the recipe (perhaps even the profile of the creator) handy and the cacao nibs ready for sale if participants want to DIY when they get home

Each month we will feature the most popular community submitted recipe during the meetup

Perhaps if web3 project wants to get their project feature, their team should compete by submitting their own recipes as well.


*Two potential methods for distributing our governance tokens too*

    - creator of winning recipe for the month 

    - off chain member who held the meetup and got critical mass of participants

*purpose*
    - serves to incentivize web3 project participation in friendly competition of who makes the best cacao recipe for the month 

    - serves to incentivize off chain member who holds the meetup to do a good job of drawing crowd 

    - to them the token will have value as it’s value is backed by the profit generated from the sale of cacao nibs they are tasting ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 9:46:59 AM] Gary Teh: Before I left Bahia, the cooperatives gave me some samples of highly differentiated cacao derivatives that were never before seen in the USA market 

They will probably need some investment before they could be brought online and made available in the USA market 

Since the samples are small, I am thinking of conducting a sample tasting and RnD prioritization session in SF when I get back. 

To ensure optimal experience, there shall only be 8 slots in this session. And they will be reserved only for DAO members who are qualified as general assembly members 🙂🙏

Full packing list 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/190Bs1VI_NY3gxZ-j7dN2N61_CDDBIfQiht9f13sGxS4/edit

Items 1 and 2 we can repackage for immediate sale on our website Agroverse.shop

Items 1-3 we will run a focus group to get some feedback with the help of @14152032783and @8618926086648 from OffChain as well as the Folks from Edge and Node

Items listed for *internal sampling*, we will invite DAO members (who are qualified as general assembly members) based in SF to come and help provide feedback and prioritize for productization 

As suggested by @5511982667030 I am chatting with @41765737357 to figure how *items 6 and 7* might be packaged as corporate gifts or gifts for special social occasions if DAO finally decides to go down the route proposed by @5511982667030 

@41765737357 did a really wonderful job with the package for LANUR cosmetics 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

This video by Steve Jobs reminds me of how our guild model operates. 

Since there is a maximum capacity of 8 players per guild, the player least able to self actualize gets invited out to free up the opportunity for another player who can more readily self actualize within the scope of the guild 

Getting the opportunity to contribute in a TrueSight DAO guild is equivalent to the opportunity to self actualization in a collaborative space of like minded individuals ‎<This message was edited>

*The following Items are addressed*:
    - Future expansion of Agroverse in the USA market beyond successful sales of 100KG cacao nibs
    - When we will finally do initial round of "fundraising" for TrueSight DA
    - Future expansion of Agroverse beyond the USA market
    - When the SunMint project will finally come online
    - How TrueSight DAO might transition into a network state

[10/4/23, 11:13:44 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to do that in @⁨[ops] The Town Hall⁩ 

In the roadmap I did indicate that at some point we might start listing our governance tokens on decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges 

But those are when our operations and cash flows have fully scaled up to make the listing cost negligible (like a drop in the ocean) compared to the volume of profit we are generating. 

I think at that point which our DAO starts generating massive volume of cash flow, governance token holders should really think long and hard if they want the tokens listed and start introducing speculative elements within our DAO (like Tesla on the stock market) or just keep the governance tokens privately held only amongst contributors (like Craigslist)

Elon Musk did ever mentioned he regret bringing Tesla public because of all the public attention and all the speculative psychology introduced that distracts all Tesla employees once during an interview 

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-has-deep-regrets

I haven’t heard any of those 20 employees working at Craigslist complaining at all. They are literally pulling millions of dollars every year just between the 20 of them. I am sure they probably have a great time throwing their own version of the Carnival of Truth every quarter in some nice locations around the world and have no investors to report to 🤣

[10/4/23, 7:04:20 PM] Gary Teh: when you examine TrueSight DAO and it’s projects critically, it is basically fundraising everyday. Though alot of times fiat did not change hands 

Me investing my time and energy in it. @16468233438 doing the same. @918017107841 doing the same. @41799155602 doing the same. Shadi helping build the main site. @5511982667030 taking precious time away from her busy schedule to help when she could be selling it for a lot more via her consulting….

Folks who helped reposting all the Linkedin posts… 

All these micro-actions contributed by DAO members in exchange for governance tokens is fund raising. It’s just that no Fiat change hands. So unless you truly understand what investment is you wouldn’t recognize it when it’s happening right under your nose

So unless there is an expense item that needs a huge amount of fiat, I really don’t see any reason why we would need to go out of our way to convince some fund managers to write a big cheque. If we ever get to the point where we are forced to do that this means there is something wrong in the way we are operating or probably tackling a problem set that is not well suited for a decentralized model. 🤔

@16468233438’s sister in law who helps tech companies fundraise was examining our operating model last year. Her first feedback was in a DAO no one is truly accountable. And VCs hate that. There is zero sense of control and there is no way to fire the “CEO” and replace him/her with a better one when performance is not good. That is because there is none. 

That was the same exact feedback when I was chatting about this model with Jerry whose wife runs a VC fund. Zero accountability. People just come in and do whatever they feel like or take a break as and when they want to. 

@14806488258 summed it up the best. There are categories of problem that will generate 100X returns and require hyper growth and a strong central command and control. Those set of problems are best tackled by the existing startups and VC model

There are a separate set of problems that do yield returns but not the 100X kind which are still socially/environmentally important to tackle and solve. Those are where DAOs play a critical role. 

The community comes together to crowd fund the solving of a problem. The output is an economically self sustaining infrastructure that benefits both the society and the environment. You would probably get some healthy return multiples from you micro-investments if things pan out but don’t expect to retire on it ‎<This message was edited>

[10/4/23, 10:27:58 PM] Gary Teh: Also speaking of fundraising to finance big ticket items, I been having this side discussion with Satheesh this past day.

Seems his feelings got hurt by me repeating the same exact warning about the macro environment here which I gave him when I realized he was attempting to fundraise last month.

Right now is the worst of the worst macro environment to hope for someone to write a big fat cheque to fund your ideas. 

*signals I am getting*

1. Federal reserve Interest rates are still hiking like crazy

2. VCs are dramatically writing down the valuations of their portfolio companies

3. More rounds of layoffs are still happening in startups 

4. LPs are skittish about funding VCs. Even VCs themselves are laying off their entry to mid level associates

Jason Calanis already issued an early warning to all startups late last year that they should have at least raised enough to last for two years because the quarter starting October 2023 is going to be the worst of the worst

 If they haven’t secured their funding by then, they should at least make sure they internally have enough to last till mid 2024 with no further external fund injection. There are so many of these startups declaring bankruptcy right now and just simply shutting down 

Everytime I go visit some  of my friends startups here these past few months, I hear through the grapevine another round of lay offs  

I was joking with @16468233438 just now when we were hanging out over at his place, I have technically structured my entire lifestyle to be as independent of fiat as possible. With the current configuration, there is no expenses spent on accommodation. Bulk of it is just spent on food and transport. 

@16468233438 was suggesting to further refine this configuration by sourcing for food when in urban settings from the food banks which run daily. Then the only thing that still relies on fiat is basically transport and software subscription cost I am incurring on behalf of the DAO. 🤔

I am actually tempted to experiment with that food bank idea of his 

Right now, after manually survey all six continents over the past five years, I am doing the exact reverse. The experiment I am conducting right now is optimizing my physical movement to have all my needs fully met without needing to step out of the 4 square blocks here in SF. 🤩

Next month, I will up the ante of this experiment by spent three weeks at the zen monastery on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge 🤣

There is no better way to reset the hedonic thread mill by hitting a hard reset button going in the opposite direction. 🤩

This deliberate self restriction of physical movement seems also aligned with what @6590995199 suggested for this period when he looked at my date and time of birth using his own fortune telling system 🤔

Side note, fiat is a proxy of the actual resource required to get stuff done. If you could by pass fiat to get the stuff done, then there is no need fiat. So if such is the case, why waste precious time and resources chasing after fiat? 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/4/23, 10:39:33 PM] Suheil - Europe: truesight dao can’t and does not need traditional fundraising methods. specifically not vc’s. . by fundraising we take cheap money and spend expensive expertise. the dao’s strength is innovating the way traditional businesses seek resources from expertise /human power to funds/budgets for scalability… the moment agroverse rolls and starts generating revenue, the dao can seek funds via “community investing/funding /grants“. 
investments /funding will be on micro and specific related subjects. 
In the moment we have operations hence we create value to truesight token and when ready/mature enough we can launch it on defi’s to generate liquidty...

[5/27/23, 7:48:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: But since u understand AI quite well. 

If I ask chatgpt for example. 

“Write a plot for a movie. Using the current political/ war climate of the world and it must involve aliens.”

The plot for this movie cannot appear?
[10/4/23, 11:45:51 PM] Anupa/diya: That's a given . For sure. If we need to digitize the ledger and if we need to scale. We will end it

[10/5/23, 12:10:52 AM] Gary Teh: In terms of digitizing the ledger, I still haven't seen anyone bother to step and be the book keeper or bother to update the ledger for their own contributions. 

If no one is already voluntarily doing that on Google sheet I wonder who will actually bother to do it on blockchain if and when we migrate over... 

All the psychological studies states more effort equals lower conversion rate... I figure until something drastically changes, it will primarily be just wishful thinking🤔🤣

[6/3/23, 7:53:36 PM] Gary Teh: Right now Barry Callebaut, Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland act as oligopoly cartel for the cacao market here in Bahia 

They set the cacao commodity price here and force it on the local producers, extracting the bulk of the profit for themselves in the process. 

The poverty here in the streets is just painful to observe. 

A successful initial transaction by us on behalf of the coop will represent a crack in this yoke the cartel has imposed on the locals. 

What we will need to focus on next is to continue working on the crack until the yoke eventually shatters 🤩

[6/5/23, 9:39:22 AM] Gary Teh: TrueSight DAO is essentially a meta-game where players contribute their expertise to our collective efforts in exchange for governance tokens in our DAO

The mission is to create profitable blockchain enabled businesses that are operated and ran by the crowd to displace exploitative practices in various industries 

The belief is that through our efforts we will displace these exploitative practices with our successful businesses thereby restoring social and environmental Justice 

Our purpose and vision is a better world based on verifiable truth. 

We are open to accepting missionaries in our guilds. contributors who are willing to exchange their effort for governance tokens 

Mercenaries, folks who want fiat in exchange for their efforts, have no business in this DAO. 

In fact, I would strongly encourage them to leave right now so as not pollute our culture 🙂🙏

[6/6/23, 3:58:14 AM] Gary Teh: Pertaining to the collaboration with the cacao cooperative in Bahia once we have figured out our very first trade route from end to end and have a working prototype we will be able to both scale the shipment of cacao from Bahia, Brazil to USA as well as start expanding our Ecoverse network to start including more cooperatives from more developing regions of the world who are still suffering under the yoke of exploitative business practices

The roadmap for the Ecoverse project that the guild is working on is documented here 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper 

Also included as part of the roadmap is where blockchain and tokenization starts getting introduced to further scale things

[6/7/23, 7:02:11 AM] Iwona Fluda: Hello Beer Hall Community!

I'm reaching out on behalf of two friends who are actively looking for promising startup investment opportunities. Here are some specifics about the type of startups they are interested in:

👉🏻 They should already have some level of proven success, either in terms of revenue generation or evident traction (such as signed contracts or a growing user base).
👉🏻 They operate within certain industries: AI, cleantech, FinTech, MedTech, and mobility are of particular interest.
👉🏻 They are currently seeking substantial financial investment to fuel their growth.

If your startup fits (or you know any startup that does fit) these criteria and you're in search of an investor, you know now where to find me! 🌟 😃 Cheers!
[10/7/23, 8:20:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: I’ll make sure to deliver some cool pics for you. 🌟

[6/8/23, 12:43:28 PM] Gary Teh: We have been invited back to Ilheus (city in Bahia region) in September to give a speech at the EBPC (national meeting for cacao producers)

This is an annual gathering of the 200 largest cacao producers here in Brazil. 

The goal of the speech is to share the roadmap for our collaboration leading up to the actualization of the Cacao Coin 

The cooperative is meanwhile helping make introductions to their contacts in the cacao industry in the Dominican Republic which I will be arriving at on 14th June later this month

[6/8/23, 2:04:53 PM] Gary Teh: Via this route the project becomes a joint venture between a few organizations, one of them being our soon to be incorporated Swiss association. 

So the Swiss association is in essence an early investor of the project

[6/8/23, 2:14:53 PM] Gary Teh: My sense (based on what I have been observing historically) is lots of folks will start privately expressing their own opinions one way or the other as soon as the first pilot test has been successfully conducted

Please don’t feel slighted if we hit that stage and I am not as responsive to you privately as you would have hoped (I am probably overwhelmed with these private one on one messages at that point and need to prioritize the use of time)

Success breeds more attention and engagement. Failure just breeds a lack of interest

[6/8/23, 4:33:00 PM] Gary Teh: In case the Swiss association doesn’t get incorporated in time (needs 35K Swiss francs) if we decided this route is a third option 

I have seen this done before via the form of investment syndicates in traditional tech startups 

Only one person’s name appears on the cap table of the incorporated entity

But there is a side agreement signed between syndicate members where the shares issued to the individual are allocated to the members of the syndicate 

In this case the counter party to the syndicate agreement will be TrueSight DAO. 

Once the Swiss association is incorporated, the shares will be transferred to the association and the name of the individual on the Cap table will be replaced by the official name of the Swiss association

I understand that @5491125130580 is in the process of mapping out what web3 organizations are providing what resources to get more projects into their ecosystem

I believe @972509342179 is doing the same right now

@918017107841 has done something already via the assembly of a grant list 

It will be helpful if we can assemble a package  from what is already out there that we can just tap on to finance the efforts of cooperatives who want to get their facilities and produce certified for exports to the US government or simply allowed for exports  

That way we can just simply deploy the necessary package and then load them on top agroverse network

[6/12/23, 11:17:53 AM] Johnny Browaeys: One thing I learned from Cocoa business in Uganda is that the logistics for collecting the beans can be used for reverse logistics of supplying the farmers with all the things they need, and another aspect is that it’s important to get all the players of the whole value chain together and smart contract their contributions. In this way, you can make the whole value chain investable as a basket of eggs instead of one single egg.

[6/12/23, 6:56:11 PM] Gary Teh: After much research, if and when we decide to bring more cooperatives on to the agroverse network unless they already qualified for importing into the USA, we will need to expend fiat capital to help qualify them and their products for import into the USA. 

I was sharing with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 today it makes sense to just setup relationships now with these cooperatives we plan to onboard but the actual onboarding will only happen once we generate enough fiat via existing trade routes to finance the onboarding of more cooperative partners onto the network

[10/10/23, 7:11:27 PM] Gary Teh: *general thoughts on marketing*

A person’s lifespan is very very short in the grander scheme of things 

The *most pathetic thing* a marketer could do is waste a viewer’s precious little attention and convey nothing!

After analyzing past messaging by marketing greats like Steve Jobs, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, this is the common theme:

You are forced to either *strongly agree* or  *strongly disagree*. Whichever the case, their message leaves zero room to simply ignore them

https://youtu.be/-z4NS2zdrZc?feature=shared
[6/12/23, 9:40:18 PM] Johnny Browaeys: are any of these in China? I am particularly interested in learning about the latest there. During my assignment with Yara in 2021 I dug a bit deeper in China's agricultural development and noticed a lot going on around ecosystems and value chains being built, and how blockchain was an enabler for this, the concept of GEP was particularly interesting: Gross Ecosystem Production, which allows to turn individual players that are hard to invest (eg. an AI company that improves cameras in drones to spot and address plant diseases) into an an easily investible ecosystem that includes the whole value chain from land to crop to farmer to harvesting to logistics to e-commerce to the cities and including finance and insurance - all in line with the goals of the central plan economy and therefore supported (the basket of eggs I mentioned above)

[6/13/23, 7:08:15 AM] Gary Teh: After studying this space Approaching the relevant cooperatives in the area as opposed to individual farmers makes better sense 

This is since the cooperatives are made up of these farmers and a very convenient aggregation point for the deployment of capital. 

Based on my conversations with representatives of the cooperatives a lot of the RnD happen at that layer and are then transmitted to individual farms by frequent visits of cooperative representatives to the farms 

Farmers are generally too engross in the day to day to undertake any form of RnD themselves
[10/10/23, 7:32:45 PM] Gary Teh: Because we are all talking about both of them right now even though none of them are  spending money on Ads to make us talk about them… 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[6/13/23, 7:35:48 AM] Gary Teh: To ensure we are engaging with the right type of cooperative as opposed to “middlemen” masking as cooperative it is important to check their governance 

A physical visit to their location to have a conversation with cooperative members and then visits to their facilities and farms to talk to members operating at the different layers will provide that required level of visibility prior to capital deployment
[10/10/23, 7:33:16 PM] Val Lapidus: I liken Trump and Elons approach to marketing as snake oil salesmen.  Their products are shit
[6/13/23, 7:37:06 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 if he so decides to go to cities where these cooperatives are based will be helpful for the initial handshake and relationship establishment between the representatives of these cooperatives and TrueSight DAO

Then we can slowly onboard them onto the agroverse network
[10/10/23, 7:33:51 PM] Val Lapidus: Our product is not shit.  So we shouldn't try to trick our consumer into buying them

[6/13/23, 4:28:03 PM] Gary Teh: The president of the Brazilian cooperative has reached out today asking if we knew about a potential buyer from USA. 

Seems we both agree the natural order of things once our infrastructure is setup is for us to handle the importing and then the distribution to companies from Northern America keen in buying produce from the cooperative 

Have spoken with @554884640132 along with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 prior to my departure to start Investigating what is required in terms of infrastructure to be able to start importing products from Northern America into Brazil. This is to handle the request for medical supplies imports 

Ideally when the two way trade routes are setup between north and South America, we minimize the need to transfer funds between the bank accounts in Brazil and USA as trade volumes stay balanced
[10/10/23, 7:37:30 PM] Val Lapidus: Integrity
[6/13/23, 5:49:43 PM] ‪+55 47 99262‑6338‬: Hey guys, i have made a decision.

I'm going to set up supply chains to get organic tobacco into the US. Only organic.

It is almost impossible to find it there and it regularly runs out of stock from the few suppliers that there are.

Who wants to help build this?
[10/10/23, 7:37:40 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure marketing folks who cares will figure something otherwise it doesn’t really matter anyways… the project and the DAo will just run out of cash and go out with a pathetic whimper

[6/13/23, 6:44:23 PM] Gary Teh: @554884640132 would also be helpful if we could also figure out what are the requirements for shipments of ceremonial tobacco and amanita muscaria from Brazil to even leave Brazilian ports. 

Seems like there might be a need to have a registered legal Brazilian entity in place before we can even begin to tackle that as well as those for importing

I understand your hedge fund facility runs a trading strategy with a sharpe ratio of 5

What would be interesting from our perspective would be if there was a way to ride on top of your facility to multiply the funds sitting in these two bank accounts as well as those sitting in our vault but have them rapidly freed up as and when liquidity is required to finance the shipments

That was something that ChatGpt proposed when I was exploring into the holdings structure the other day

[6/14/23, 5:32:24 AM] Gary Teh: Very wonderful share the speaker touched upon a lot of the issues we considered at when attempting to actualize our purpose of “Building a better world based on verifiable Truth” 

During our attempts we realized there were actually two classes of problems 

Class 1: marketing is desirable while accountability and transparency is not necessarily desirable for the producers generating the resource / content / service and they do not see value in paying for accountability and transparency in one form or another 

Class 2: marketing is desirable. accountability and transparency is a core part of the marketing for producers generating the resource / content / service and they were willing to pay for the accountability and transparency in one form or another 

Earlier we committed the mistake 3 times of attempting to solve problems from class 1. 

    - fake news (project: Edgar v1)
    - fake trading signals (project: market monocle)
    - web3 scams (project: cypher defense) 


Agroverse is probably the first time we landed correctly upon a Class 2 problem. The producers see a lot of value promoting accountability and transparency as it directly helps with their product differentiation and marketing efforts 

Given that we are DAO and resources contributed by members is strictly voluntary base, I feel it is important we direct them towards problems where market participants are receptive to our efforts as opposed to being apathetic or downright hostile. 

This allows us the ability to tap on one of the primary cognitive bias that makes us human (social reciprocity bias) and turn it into a virtuous cycle  

Recognition of our efforts by producers encourage and energize DAo members to want to contribute more and that in turns energize producers to want to support our efforts even more. And meanwhile real social and economic value is generated to sustain the producers, our DAO members and the consumers at large 

We end up with a win win win dynamic ( aka triple bottom line)

[6/17/23, 7:19:08 AM] Gary Teh: I was just rethinking through the fiat currency fundraising and injection route into our ecosystem 

Raised capital sits within TrueTech Inc (holding bay) and is only recognized as injected into a guild project (or our DAO) when expenses are paid using those funds. 

Via this route, there is no sale of tokens. This avoids transgressing SEC regulations. 

When TrueTech Inc pays for expenses incurred during the execution of our roadmap, These expenses are recognized as operating expenses of the company when yearly tax reports are filed with the US government. 

Meanwhile, TrueTech Inc gets awarded governance tokens by TrueSight DAO for contributing to the payment of these expenses that are much needed for execution of TrueSight DAO roadmap

Folks who injected capital in TrueTech Inc only control voting rights of the governance tokens awarded so far to TrueTech Inc by our DAO
 
This ends up forming two parallel accounting system for the same exact set of financial transactions. One reported to the US government to remain compliant, the other that controls the award of DAO governance tokens (and voting rights)

The side effect of this approach is the traditional that “pump and dump” schemes prevalent in the web3 space are by default not possible. That helps to filter out folks who are not aligned with our DAO’s core values

A lot of capital can be raised by TrueTech Inc but not yield any increase in the net book value of our governance tokens (total fiat assets in our treasury versus total governance tokens issued thus far for contributions made)

The performance of our governance tokens’ net book value is purely merit based and dependent on the profits generated from commercial activities in our various guilds 

Via this structure the option to raise fiat capital to help finance our DAO’s projects via uncapped SAFE also becomes available.

[10/12/23, 11:45:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: i want to participate at the accelerator too 😛
[6/19/23, 4:19:20 AM] Gary Teh: Simple question: if that opportunity is associated with some form of social or environmental injustice and will it boost the net book value of our governance tokens within the next 365 days if we pursue it by creating a guild within our DAO? 

If the answer is yes, then we should definitely share it here 🤩

If not share it in the Do Nothing Society 🙂

[10/12/23, 11:46:05 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! Let's do it!! In fact all token holders should be allowed to attend

Aka making money to boost the value of our governance tokens by disrupting existing business model that are environmentally and socially unjust 🤩
[10/12/23, 11:47:27 AM] Suheil - Europe: in fact the iideal strategy iis to accelerate truesight by teaming up 50+ members joining ddozens of global accelerators all aat the same time and then hit a “decentraliized” PRs at the same periiod in different point of eaarth ;p

Later this week me and @18298364965 are looking forward to visiting their head office to liaise with their sales office as well as other partner companies we will need help with

[6/20/23, 6:55:34 PM] Gary Teh: You might want to communicate that this might potentially be the start of a new project that seeks to address social injustice in the hospitality industry. And, if the stars align, will end up resulting in the forming of new guild within our DAO governed using the same set of rubrics we are right now using in our DAO.

However discussions are still in the early stages and the outcome dependent on conversations that will be had with other potential ecosystem partners to determine their ability and willingness to collaborate and what they want in return for their resource inputs. 🙂🙏

What type of electronic hacking do you do?

Do you do breadboard and soldering as well?

Might come in useful for apartment management

[6/20/23, 7:56:54 PM] Gary Teh: Build out electronics, installed to control access to various apartments 

When a person wants to enter an apartment, he needs to flash his phone to a physical reader that you built 

If the phone’s wallet contains enough tokens, the owner is granted access to the apartment
[10/13/23, 2:39:01 PM] Gary Teh: That is so wonderful!! 🤩
[6/20/23, 7:57:21 PM] Gary Teh: The token balance is automatically deducted from the wallet installed on the phone

[10/14/23, 12:34:27 AM] Gary Teh: What’s up! Nice to have met you again at the HackerDojo meetup 

You got really lucky with your timing dude all the other folks from the meetup that want to join our DAO now have to pay a toll (one way or another) to get into our channels 🤣

    - either await interview to be onboarded into one of our existing roles 

    - or pay USD100 before being allowed in

My sense is from this point forth, it is going to get more and more demanding to qualify for entry into our DAO

As @31641075825 mentioned, the engine has started and the boat has left the port. All the folks who haven’t boarded the boat while it was still docked will need to start working harder to get onboard 🚀💎 ‎<This message was edited>

Haven’t had the chance to attend any cacao ceremonies myself

Will have more visibility once I get the chance to attend cacao ceremonies conducted by at least 3 different shamans

My sense is the triangulation of the qualitative data gathered from these three events  gathered will provide the necessary insight on how the tokenomics for this portion of the ecosystem will work 🙂

https://truesight.me/
[6/28/23, 12:55:48 PM] Arti - Berkeley: I would be careful at mentioning weight loss as the primary sell, many people don't want to lose weight, and it could be triggering for someone with body image issues or EDs, perhaps a more holistic approach to wellness without considering weight or diets could be the focus 🙂
[10/16/23, 11:51:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: this is new reel its  a story . I will “bubble” it dont worry i am all under control for now
[6/28/23, 12:57:07 PM] Arti - Berkeley: A keto diet is also not the best diet to follow for some people, so I would be careful with advertising that 🙂

[6/28/23, 12:58:39 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: arti great think but the good question is are we going to sell to one specific direction for this tipe of need or is general selling?

[6/28/23, 4:47:27 PM] Gary Teh: At some stage we definitely should. It will cost us/them a fraction to bank on the upside and protect the downside. 

I doubt they are familiar, but I’m sure their chain of clients are.

It depends on the quantity we can gather and the type of commodity to be delivered: cocoa vs. cacao…

[6/28/23, 4:49:08 PM] Gary Teh: Futures contracts are generally tools used to even out the price of a commodity in the future

Especially useful for the manufacturers further down the value chain

In this case, it’s applicable to us. Every spike like this that you just shared eats into our DAO’s profit margin

[6/28/23, 4:51:12 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective since we are unlike other retailers without significant amount of fix overheads

Whenever macro environment become unfavorable if we are not future hedge, we can always opt to not have any of our inventory supply available for sale to end consumer

[6/29/23, 6:32:03 AM] Gary Teh: In that theoretical model, governors (legislative branch) will only be responsible for updating the ledger to tokenize member contributions.

[6/29/23, 6:44:11 AM] Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli: Hi,
My point was the following: 
With a Swiss association, there are necessarily (i) a committee (or board) and (ii) members. Then, pursuant to the articles of association, there may be additional "bodies" such as a "board of governors" or the like, with specific tasks/roles.
You may - by analogy and with some limits - see the GM (i.e. the members) as a _legislative body_ and the committee/board as an _executive body_, but it would be more questionable to see a _judicial branch/body_ in this picture (I would say that the analogy reaches its limits before you get there...).
[10/19/23, 8:31:22 PM] Mary Carbajal, B1OS: I’ll msg you directly
[6/29/23, 6:44:50 AM] Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli: I agree.

[10/19/23, 9:38:12 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 mentioned that a T-shirt will cost USD30 to print 

The cheapest way to test how viable this guerilla style marketing tactic would work would be for me to just go manually test this in the street of SF.

If we are able to generate 14+6 bags of cacao nibs of sale just by me doing my *Hobo thing* along *haight street* over the course of two weeks, this means this approach is both sustainable and scalable 

The sale covered the cost of the shirt as well as the cost of providing the *leather tramp* 1 meal a day 🤩

    - our market messaging 
    - the 4 profiles we should be keeping in mind for our messaging and their corresponding CTA
    - the mechanics of how we are right now running our marketing efforts 
    - how we can tap leverage reporters once we have the right CTAs targeted at the right profiles and broadcasted in the right channels (with the help of reporters)

[7/6/23, 1:36:46 PM] Gary Teh: This new form we have made available for DAO members to submit their preferred rate is going to be a very interesting dynamic to observe

https://truesight.me/dao/preferred-rate

My hunch is members who plan to utilize the outputs generated via the network would probably want this rate to be as low as possible so as to minimize the amount they end up paying for the final end product. 

While members who spent a lot of effort setting up the network would probably want the rate to be as high as possible so as to maximize the amount of value captured for transactions passing through this network. 

Or perhaps as @31641075825 suggested, most of the members will probably not care to vote until such a day when a huge volume of transactions start passing through this network on a daily basis and our DAO ends up accumulating a lot of liquidity.

I am aware that the Standard Rate is already immediately applicable for what @573136732781 has in mind since she is planning to directly procure the ceremonial grade inventory we have available right now for her cacao ceremony.

[10/24/23, 11:40:37 PM] Gary Teh: I was having a chat over the phone just now with both my parents back in Singapore. 

I shared about the 0% sales conversion rate last Friday. 🤦‍♂️🤣

Strangely my dad immediately focused on a totally different metric. *did people like what they tasted at the sampling event?* 

My response: Yes they did. “Perfect score then” was his response  

Though I still remain skeptic. until I see actual sales taking place, I will default assume the *Yes* I am hearing is basically a polite *No* in disguise. I have been suckered too many times with this phenomena I just described 

Me and @16468233438 for purpose for our experiment will attempt to offload our entire inventory at the forthcoming night market happening on the 1st of November. 

Dad seems as bullish as @16468233438 about that forthcoming. I remain skeptical until the actual sales data gathered after the event. 

Dad proceeded to explain the parameters he was actively monitoring when he and mum scaled the meat distribution business in Singapore back in the early 80s

*High Level Heuristics*

    - don’t overinvest in infrastructure unless sales volume justifies it 

    - don’t over delay the investment in infrastructure as sales volume scales to such an extend it hampers growth 

    - the food distribution is a retention business more than it is an growth above all else business. Quality Control is hyper critical. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/8/23, 7:07:34 PM] Gary Teh: From my prespective, these two transactions are just purely experimental 

No freighting cost was included since they arrived in the country in my backpack

[10/24/23, 11:51:13 PM] Gary Teh: he proceeded to share the scaling process both of them went through for their food distribution business in the 80s and 90s as well as the scaling process of 3 to 4 of the larger consumer brands in Singapore. 

Amazingly those brands went through the same process as we are doing right now. Two of them started with very very small batch of 5kg produce initially brought in from China

As I listen through the case studies he presented, it occurred to me that without realizing it, we have cracked a very critical component in the Agroverse network without realizing it. 

We have managed to successfully establish a trickling stream of inbound suppliers. 

And the virality baked right into the heart of our DAO is starting pull in more suppliers from regions of the world that we are targeting to source from for our Agroverse network. 

Once we successfully crack the buy side, my sense is the self compounding effect of our network and its virality will become more and more pronounced ‎<This message was edited>

Portland thereafter

This city by city expansion pattern starts feeling a lot similar to  pattern described by @6598383264 that Chinese companies follow to expand across China 
    - tier 1 cities 
    - tier 2 cities
    - tier 3 cities

*Another key insight*
Enterprise customers they acquired initially came as consumers visiting their food stall at the wet market

she started her own chocolate business for cacao rituals. she is a swiss model.
[7/8/23, 7:28:52 PM] Gary Teh: As I have mentioned to a bunch of folks in our DAO few times over and again. 

It is always best to test an entire concept end to end before we even bother ourselves with writing a single line of code to build any app

[10/25/23, 12:07:33 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩

Everyone said they loved the taste of the hot chocolate but no one seem to ask where they could buy it 😭

Though it did translate into free food and a basketball game next weekend 🤔🤣

one of the attendees at the event invited me to go join him for dinner and watch a minor league basketball game with his son. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/9/23, 6:53:15 AM] Gary Teh: General observation Is that reading white papers to understand the operating model behind each project is a tedious process. 

Life might become easier if we create explanatory videos using AIs in the future to communicate how each project works

[7/9/23, 8:31:40 PM] Gary Teh: I am just trying to figure out how far can we really push this whole concept of automating everything with all the AI tools out there without too much human inputs. 

I imagine a day when the machines can automatically detect our needs, create all the services to cater to those needs  and then generate the smart contracts automatically on blockchain to make those services available. 

The vision is there, it probably needs more RnD before it can be actualized and we go permanently join the Do Nothing Society

[10/25/23, 12:20:38 AM] Gary Teh: Main reason why I would use lip balm during winter is…

Either put on the lip balm or really feel the pain when your lips start to bleed after it cracks while you are outdoors during winter season 😱

Idea of Pain = fight or flight = auto pilot = automatically buy if you happen to be stuck outdoors without lip balm 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

It was a very interesting experience, I got my hands very dirty scaling a database as well as an entire ETL infrastructure to handle the crazy volume of data harvested from the open web

Am I right that people love the cacao but hard to sell any at the events? Do you have a table with a sign where you try to sell with a big sign at the events? Do they let you do a quick talk before the speakers start about our DAO story? Do we have some charity that we give a very small percentage of the proceeds to like displaced children of Cocoa farmers or something? That can help in the beginning so people feel like by buying the cocoa they are also helping a cause on top of fighting the exploration of cocoa farmers.

[10/26/23, 4:26:57 PM] Jonathan: If you were providing cocoa at an event I was organizing I would put a small line in the poster saying ‘Hear the story of how TrueSight DAO is revolutionizing the supply chain for Cocoa farmers in Latin America and taste their product. I would give you five minutes at the beginning of the event to talk about the DAO. I would then give you a seat at a table on the side where you would put up your banner and sell your product. I am guessing this is along the lines of what is happening but just giving input from a web3 event organizer point of view.  I had you there selling product at a table then it would give some credibility to my event and it might attract other cool sponsors that wanted to sell their product

As mentioned I am not a very sociable person when surrounded by too many people at the same time… my brain’s *fight or flight* mechanism just kicks into override. 

Somehow for @16468233438 it seems to be triggering the release of dopamine in his brain instead. 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

I don’t see much of this money cargill is making flowing to the cacao farmers in the cooperatives we are working with 

The big three (Cargill amongst them) just suppress the purchase price offered to the farmers in Bahia and Ecuador.

[10/26/23, 9:05:22 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to focus on what our goal is for each event.  You can't go to a tech event and try to sell cacao nibs.  You want to sell cacao names? We need to find a keto foods event.  At these events where it's tech events, the right path to approach is to gain Instagram followers and tell our message about how we utilize web3 for our project.  We are exploring also the idea of creating stalls for farmers markets where we will sell hot chocolate.  And then once proving out that use case that that is a profitable method, we will set up a franchising opportunity for others to open their own stalls within their own farmers markets

[7/14/23, 5:10:17 PM] Gary Teh: One key difference between Agroverse and other cacao nibs maker out there is that we are technically more a community project (cooperative) than a profit oriented company (especially those competing on Amazon). 

And based on the preferred rates that I observed submitted so far, a way larger portion of our net profit is going to be directed back to these agricultural communities we sourced from than one would see in a normal profit oriented company… 81% 😮

[7/14/23, 5:32:49 PM] Gary Teh: The more we can help sustain the livelihoods of farmers utilizing such farming methods along the edges of the Amazon forest, the less likely they will give up on it and turn the forest into pasture, the longer we can forestall the actual deforestation of the Amazon that is happening on a large scale right now 

When I was speaking to the guide while I was in the Amazon what I learned was that a lot of the farmers are just basically giving up and clearing up their private patch of Amazon forest to cultivate soy for export to China instead 🤔

[7/15/23, 11:29:42 AM] Gary Teh: One recurring theme during my discussion with @12023686334 on separate occasions is that at the commodity level a bag of cacao nibs is still functionally a bag of cacao nibs after taking into account the following

    - nutrient level
    - price
    - logistics

What really differentiates a bag of cacao nibs from from all the other bags of cacao nibs out there is the story behind it.

[10/28/23, 11:41:03 PM] Jonathan: I think you could follow the eggnog way - "If you would like to add alcohol to your eggnog, choose a drink with a high alcohol concentration to help counterbalance the sweetness of the eggnog.  Common choices of alcohol to add to eggnog include brandy, rum, bourbon or whisky."
[7/16/23, 11:15:31 AM] Suheil - Europe: https://t.me/c/1923923992/569
[10/28/23, 11:41:42 PM] Jonathan: While brandy is the most traditional alcohol to pair with eggnog, according to traditional recipes, you can also use a mixture of dark rum and Cognac. If you like your eggnog with more of a kick you can also add bourbon, but we recommend sticking to rum and Cognac to preserve the 'nog's flavors

[10/28/23, 11:42:27 PM] Jonathan: Brandy: Makes the Most Traditional Eggnog
For the most traditional holiday experience, reach for brandy (specifically, Cognac) to spike your 'nog. It's important to note, though, that both brandy and eggnog are quite sweet. Combining them will produce something that someone with a sweet tooth will love, but that others may find cloying. Proceed with caution.

Also for us to qualify as a Cult, there needs to be cult leader worshipping activities present. However if you haven't noticed yet, folks generally give me (the supposed cult leader) shit publicly and privately when things don't work. And often times, in our still infantile system of 2 years, they need more ironing.

So my role is more of the janitor (cleaning up shit). 

For folks who habitually come to me saying I should act as the leader and order people around, please do understand about the only thing I can really do is figure out what is a rule that could be surfaced for voting and adoption into our DAO's constitution.

Congratulations, you have raised your first VC round! Now what? In addition to having capital to build, you now have investors who are rooting for you and want to help you succeed. You also likely have reporting responsibilities along with commitments to good governance. Come hear from Em Westerhold, a16z's partner in charge of financial advisory for the crypto fund who will be sharing what you can expect and how to make the most from your new stakeholders. Also, if you are just getting ready for your first funding, Em will share her perspective on some housekeeping best practices so you are 'VC' ready.

[7/23/23, 9:30:40 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through all the functions that would exist in a traditional company, seems the one and only function that is absolutely critical to Agroverse’s success is as @12023686334 suggested… the Marketing function 

Coincidentally this podcast landed in my inbox around the same time I came to this conclusion, and I just finished listening to it 

https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hBM4RYc3nv9a6QArrKfZV

The gist of getting from USD0 to USD10 million in revenue within a year, 5 things:

    1 - figure out your UVP 

    2 - figure out how to explain your UVP in one sentence that will drive at least 1% conversion rate from initial contact to sales  

    3 - prioritize the marketing channels based on scalability 

    4 - package your UVP for delivery in the marketing channels that will elicit the WTF response as compared to other brands competing in the space

    5 - or find a channel that is not yet utilized by other competing brands

[7/24/23, 11:25:12 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me that there are two prevailing mental models that members in our DAO are unconsciously using



*Mental model 1: we are a community/social network*

When activity level (sound bites) is low within our channel, members using this mental model will interprete it as a sign of low engagement level (aka ill health in our DAO). We need to do something to reengage the members to drive up activity level (aka sound bites)



*Mental model 2: we are a board of directors actualizing a shared vision*

When sound bite level in the channels get too high, members using this mental model will get annoyed because there is too much distraction. 

What they really care about are the following:

    - good news (where should we gather to pop the champagne)
    - bad news (shit happened, what to expect next)
    - progress (where are we now, what to expect next)
    - what needs to be done next and how can they help 



*my perspective*
Around 50% of last year was spent experimenting with mental model 1. Also running in parallel was this collective soul searching process where we iteratively figured out our DNA (core values, mission,  purpose and vision). 

Personally, the mental model 1 experiment was an extremely entertaining experience. 🤣

But based on the occasional private feedback from quite a few folks who were looking at it purely from mental model 2, the extreme level of sound bites were considered super distractive and somewhat annoying. 

Now that our purpose, mission and core values are clearly defined thanks to the collective effort these past period, the heightened levels of sound bites when gauged against this clearly defined set of standards did not really help advance us towards actualizing our vision.  

A better indicator of DAO health from the mental model 2 paradigm is the likelihood members will voluntarily step forward to help tackle a problem whenever one surfaces as we progress along our journey of actualizing our shared vision. Or in the scenario where skillset is honestly lagging, voluntarily recruit a new member that has it. 

Based on this indicator, even if the sound bites level in our channels is dead as a cemetery, so long as problems are getting solved and recruitment are taking place, our DAO is still considered extremely healthy.

[7/25/23, 11:35:19 PM] Gary Teh: If no one buys any of the NFTs and the entire shipment is sold successfully then all the profits generated goes back to the DAO

If all the NFTs are sold off and the entire shipment is sold off, then (based on the Standard Rate) only 20% of the profit gets channeled back to the DAO. The NFT holders get 80% of the generated profit.

[10/30/23, 11:32:06 PM] Gary Teh: Started consuming this bar of magic mushroom laced chocolate (one small chunk every evening) which @17755088150 gifted me last Halloween when I was passing through Portland Oregon. It’s effect had been truly fascinating 

You literally feel nothing different than you would consuming a regular chunk of chocolate, but two three hours post consumption, patterns that were staring straight me in the face for a long long time that I have been blind to suddenly became obvious 🤯

My friend who is a master forager has been conducting master classes where he teaches people how to turn acorn into tortillas.  he charges USD80 per person and it’s a full class of 20 people for 6 hours. Basically USD1200 of net profit per session 

https://youtu.be/rmulfscDVNU?si=1SHx9rEvtzpEWERB

I don’t see why we shouldn’t occasionally run classes where we charge the same amount for teaching people how to make choclate from cacao nibs 

It’s a novelty that even Jerry and his kids find fascinating enough to want to do everytime I go visit them 🤯

I wouldn’t mind moving front one hippie colony to the next conducting classes like these. It would be quite fun and not as equipment intensive as the idea that @16468233438 suggested 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

I have personally set aside some funds which I will be happy to invest into the Shipment Financing NFTs of Agroverse if it’s structured in such a way it’s attractive for me as a fiat investor 

Not sure if you noticed… I have took off my operator/builder hat and looking at the deal purely from an investor perspective now that it’s starting to shape up for deal readiness. 🙂

Their ultra risk taking behavior tends to send their domestic partners scrambling in panic in the opposite direction as and when they go through one of those *100% conviction* episodes

Weisi use to work for Amazon and was for a while the Venture team for Aminoca brand (a really large Web3 fund focused on games)

Will offer Shirley access to mint the Agroverse shipment financing NFT when it becomes available

Will chat with WeiSi to get some insights on where the Aminoca brand is headed regarding investment themes to figure if there might be any alignment with our project when she invites over for the gathering of friends she mention she was going to organizing.

[7/29/23, 12:04:57 PM] Gary Teh: Great session with @14152032783 and @8618926086648 where we chatted about the tokenomics for OffChain to mobilize community members in various cities around the world to organize IRL events and how TrueSight DAO could tap into that infrastructure (which we did a few times already) to source for new members to support the community ESG projects our DAO is pursuing in those parts of the world. 

There is a natural synergy there. The value of OffChain token and the TrueSight DAO token naturally reinforces and energizes each other’s value. 🤩

[7/29/23, 12:13:44 PM] Gary Teh: I see the same for the House of Balance Tokens too. Me and @13104674556 we’re chatting about this yesterday when we met 

At some point when Agroverse and other projects start pulling in profits, we could vote to direct some of those to support House of Balance activities lead by @33652866472 and @13104674556 

Already TrueSight DAO have benefitted tremendously from that ecosystem with some really high powered members recruited from it

[11/2/23, 9:23:14 AM] Iwona Fluda: We are planning to organize similar events globally in the coming months, so there is lots of potential, including but not limited to:
[7/29/23, 12:19:07 PM] Gary Teh: Impactful insights and contributions you made to our DAO today @13134136108  🙂🙏
[11/2/23, 9:23:37 AM] Iwona Fluda: here are the ideas that Chat GPT gave me:
    Token Integration: Incorporating governance tokens into the fabric of the summit activities, allowing participants to earn tokens through meaningful contributions, engagement in discussions, and by providing valuable feedback.

    Community Building: Using the tokens to build a sense of ownership and community among the attendees. This can encourage ongoing participation and investment in the network, as each member will have a stake in the collective success.

    Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices through a tokenized platform can ensure that the value generated at the summit extends beyond the event itself, contributing to a growing body of collective intelligence.

    Collaborative Innovation: Encouraging participants to propose and develop projects that align with the summit's goals, with governance tokens acting as a means for the community to vote and decide on the projects they find most promising.

    Continuity and Growth: By connecting each event to the next through governance tokens, we can create a continuous loop of value creation and sharing. This can lead to more significant advancements and breakthroughs in the fields we are passionate about.

    Network Expansion: As the community and its governance token system mature, the network effect can attract more talent and resources, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that grows in value with each event and interaction.

Leaderboards drive motivation and competition in games. Once our voting passes, the governor profiles on TrueSight DAO's Crunchbase become our exclusive meta game leaderboard. It showcases your achievements, fostering recognition and motivation within our community and the wider Web3.0 tech ecosystem.

As TrueSight DAO grows stronger, your individual profile ranking on Crunchbase will also increase, gaining you more personal recognition in the Web3.0 tech ecosystem.

Keep up the great work! 🤩👍

[11/3/23, 10:45:59 AM] Gary Teh: I noticed the traditional jargon for the use of *founder* seem to be very pervasive 

Besides calling all governance token holders *contributors* we should just call them *founders* well

So technically we have close to 300 governance token holders (aka founders)

Just go ahead and apply as you would a *founder* 🤣

I noticed that @14152032783also listed @13104674556 as founder on the event sheet created for this Sunday’s event 

@16468233438 also asked if he could use the founder title at some point 

Let’s just democratize the use of the term *founder* within our DAO 🤩

The Source then invited other people into the “field”, the vision for the project / initiative, in order to realise it. People come in as either other sources (realising their own idea / vision within the field) or employees (simply providing time / talent for salary). How did the idea of the DOA started? Who took the first step to realise it?!

[8/2/23, 6:53:10 PM] Gary Teh: This thread about sharing insights on cacao nibs for keto use on reddit is taking off like wildfire right now

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/15ge8eq/anyone_one_had_any_experience_using_cacao_nibs_in/

I still haven’t found a smooth transition to direct any of them to sign up for ouronline focus group via meetup.com

Ends up the snowballing conversation with all the keto Redditers are organically throwing off a whole bunch of insights into their keto consumption behavior

I think this problem you are observing is mainly the result of my profile. I have this tendency to just allow someone whom I am speaking to to just go where he/she naturally wants to go instead of directing them to go where I want them to go. Or even when we are hanging out we just end up going where the companion wants to go.

And yes, I will eventually head the way I want to go, but only after bidding them farewell with a smile and seeing them disappear around the bend. 

Compound this dynamic over a series of interactions with multiple people, instead of having a group of people congregating, we end up with a series of very deep one of one conversations between myself and a whole bunch of other people. Deep as in I totally understand what is going on in each and everyone of their head. Not sure if it actually goes the other way though because I default to the role of listener unless specifically prompted with a problem to think about and discuss. 🤔
[11/3/23, 5:50:19 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO has went through a bunch of evolution 

Initially a few key principles were just surfaced during random conversations and they somehow started forming a *Mandelbrot pattern* which just kept on growing on its own

Those key principles have been applied by the various individuals independently for along time prior. But somewhere somehow they collided within the network and the crystallization started happening ‎<This message was edited>

[8/2/23, 7:15:06 PM] Gary Teh: Another interesting aspects of the Agroverse network to study and observe once it’s set up is the prisoner dilemma (cycle of destruction mechanism) that’s backed right into its core. 

Since prices of every single component of a shipment of cacao to the USA will be written into the blockchain for all to see, suppliers might initially “abuse” the network by baking too much margin into their quotation. however as we continue to scale by onboarding and making transparent more suppliers and their prices, the assumption is that suppliers will all end up keeping each other in check when they do provide their quotations or risk being cut out of the network for providing very uncompetitive pricing

This abridged (5 slides) version of how our DAO works seem to drive the message through this community and got them really psyched about it

PS: I was just throwing these slides together to answer your question just now and realized they were having lightning talks this evening at the HackerDojo 

What a synchronicity 🤩

Bulk of the members in our DAO are high level, high impact, highly connected individuals.

While it’s ok to manually test the viability of a process utilizing DAO members time, beyond the testing phase and entering into the execution phase, unless an activity in the process is generating at least USD100/hour of value (as according to our rubric) for the utilization of any DAO members time, the task should be reconsidered in the following order: 

    1 - dropped if possible 
    2 - automated using AI.
    3 - delegated to a non-DAO member (non believer)

[8/5/23, 1:40:57 AM] Gary Teh: @919210068790 I remember you issued NFTs in India to raise funds to finance of shipment of rice out of the country. However it eventually got blocked by the Indian government 

@918017107841 is also based in India. She is right now designing a similar set of NFTs for Agroverse’s upcoming shipment of cacao nibs from South America to North America 

Perhaps the both of you should speak. I believe since both of you are in the same time zone collaboration should hopefully be easier 🙂👍
[11/4/23, 6:56:56 PM] Gary Teh: Ended up browsing through the AI market place that he recommended and found this one that is more suitable to our needs instead. The results are much closer but much work needs to be done still. Here is a recording of the failed attempt for folks who are keen

[11/5/23, 1:06:22 AM] Gary Teh: Actually when I think about it, DAO voting is not really necessary for spinning up such kinds of system as it’s basically individual members exercising their own personal *Autonomy* ‎<This message was edited>

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chocolate-making-ingredient-cocoa-hits-highest-price-46-years-2023-06-28/

Price of cacao is expected to keep increasing over the next few years 

Based on what I observed when visiting Brazil and the Dominican Republic, we should expect supplies to continue rising for the foreseeable future 

And cacao does store very well for long periods of time if stored in the right conditions

- Retailers have specific manufacturers they work with instead of producing the chocolate themselves 

- Manufacturers would be inclined to purchase the cacao nibs and keep them in stock ‎<This message was edited>

[8/8/23, 10:40:25 AM] Gary Teh: After spending two years observing and studying the generalized behavioral patterns within our DAO, I note that unless a professional is working in the sales and promotion (marketing) field, a professional who places a high dollar value on his/her personal time will not engage in much conversations in chatrooms. 

One on one is the preferable method of communication. 

And the agenda needs to be set very clearly upfront.

I think her efforts at exercising her *autonomy* to creatively solve a problem was commendable 🙂🙏
[8/8/23, 4:55:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Much like in the Mayans skimping on quality and mixing orgin beans with sad beans was a thing

*Diversity* is one of our core values

[8/8/23, 5:00:30 PM] Gary Teh: I might be biased but it still default to our Brazilian cacao nibs
I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

Makes total sense everytime we call an hour meetup where we have a whole bunch of attendees with no clear relationship as why they are attending and how the presence is related to the agenda, we are wasting 100 governance tokens from our very limited supply for each person per hour.
[11/8/23, 9:03:57 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform 

What a match made in heaven!! 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

Those servers should theoretically run forever when deployed on the farmers’ premises 

Since we are considering the use of Proof of Authority for TrueChain, they should not cause too much heat generation

[8/10/23, 11:29:01 PM] Gary Teh: interesting how Jerry immediately homed in on the zero accountability characteristic that’s been baked right into the DNA of the DAO that Cindy (whom you introduced last year) pointed out when she was looking into our structure last year which from her perspective is disconcerting to traditional investors
[11/9/23, 10:50:23 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s get his and Micheal’s feedback 

If they feel receptive enough about it then we can trail tested it
[8/10/23, 11:35:58 PM] Gary Teh: After Jerry left for home, me and Allison stuck around for a short bit where we chat about our tendency to keep injecting entropy into the system whenever we observe it on the cusp of achieving some form of equilibrium. Basically a dissipative structure 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system
[11/9/23, 10:58:55 PM] Gary Teh: I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

Just some random ideas to popped into my mind just now 🤷‍♂️🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 11:38:47 PM] Gary Teh: Jerry was joking about the human mechanical Turk where AI defines the strategy and humans perform the offline action 

Taking a step back and looking at where we are heading it does feel like our DAO is slowly headed in that general direction with the introduction of ChatGpt as the unofficial member which gets utilized a lot in the background

[8/12/23, 12:07:39 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: does Edgar agree. Does it reflect the truth, or are the reports being exaggerated just to provide entertainment for the Western world and distract them from their own problems?
[11/10/23, 1:19:55 AM] Gary Teh: They probably thought the rules that were voted into our constitution/white paper did not apply to them or thought they could probably get away with breaking rules once these have been voted into place 

Or they came into the ecosystem before those ruled were put in place and did not bother to keep abreast of rule changes that have been voted into effect 

The folks that stuck around modified their behavior to fit the rules once informed 

Those that left because they suddenly realized there was no more value to be derived and there was nothing they want to contribute in the first place. They were just in here for sales lead generation to power their own business models. 

They opted to leave. Though we do have a three strikes and you are out policy. They did not even get to strike 2 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 1:25:25 AM] Gary Teh: You were not being kicked out but rotated out 

The guild have a different set of rules that were voted in  

A maximum capacity of 8

When a new active members need to join, the least active is invited out 

All the other seven were active on some ongoing tasks ‎<This message was edited>
[8/12/23, 8:54:19 AM] Gary Teh: Not catchy enough to make it to the top 100 most popular keywords

[8/12/23, 11:01:20 PM] Gary Teh: It is a recurring pattern I observe that whenever a person is attempting to profit from information arbitrage, he/she will exhibit very cagey behavioral patterns. 

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space. Based on what I have heard so far via the extended network, depending on where we attempt to bring this disruption to (especially in areas where cartels are in control), some of us might even encounter assassination attempts. Sounds exciting... 🤔

[11/10/23, 1:33:55 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. @557391090002 was recently invited out because when we did an audit amongst ourselves he had no active scope 

Happy to introduce 1 more guild member who can commit time on a weekly basis in there.  

I know @972543523823 would be the 8th person but @31641075825 basically interfaces all the communications for her and she rarely goes into group chats

I am aware Emelin is trying to onboard a new designer she can work directly with. Not sure if that 8th should be used for him since feels like Emelin will be interfacing with the new designer if he wants to join 

But otherwise from what I am aware of so far we need these two additional roles

_Role 1_
a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

_PS: Also please don’t self define a role of being a manager to oversee other members._

_The guild size is small enough that members should be able to self manage and self execute once given the instructions manual on how to operate some functions_ 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/12/23, 11:21:32 PM] Gary Teh: I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

[11/13/23, 12:02:03 AM] Gary Teh: *Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/13/23, 12:12:17 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of brutal, Open Sea just laid off 50% of their employees 2 days ago.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-staff-severance-version-2-0-launch

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.

[11/14/23, 12:20:14 PM] Gary Teh: Additional insights from Ray Wu (Y-Combinator Alumni) 

*key insights*
    - tech scene is so abysmal right now no one wants to think about it that is why a lot of tech folks are looking into the FnB space 

    - VCs don’t really do much except _sell the money_ they took from someone else (_Limited Partners_) for hopefully at least a 3X return to keep their job. They market themselves as _value adding_ to try sell their money at a premium to unsuspecting founders but actually not much value add in hindsight

- people come in at seed and pre-seed with the belief in the _greater fool theory_ that someone will buy out their position at Series A for a 3X return. 

- bulk of the rich folks belong to the NATO category by default (_no action talk only_). See them for what they are. Tap on their network of relationships if applicable otherwise be judicious in deployment of operator’s (_person who actually executes_) time beyond what is necessary to maintain the relationship ‎<This message was edited>

[11/18/23, 9:08:22 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that the cooperative we are working with in Brazil have been actively exploring this concept with a supposed tech solutions provider while I was there

Unfortunately based on what I understood later on, the tech solutions provider ghosted on them... (_ghosting seem to be a prevalent phenomena in the web3 space… I had even offered to meetup with the tech solutions provider to explore collaborate while I was there… but to no avail…_) 

The upside is, once we have proven the end to end model for Agroverse that door is right now left wide open for us to step right in to fill up that gaping hole left by the tech solutions provider. 

According to our new _4 rules rubric system_ we should in principle award governance token to the tech solutions provider that ghosted on the cooperative. 

This is because he did spend time educating the market on our behalf… he just did not deliver on his promise… 🤔🤣

Perhaps after Europe beginning of the year, India and China will be on my next stops to help setup the inbound trade links for @120363044028036610@g.us (_Silk Road 5.0 - horde managed trading network based on humane values_) 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

With the exception of Vipassana which is donation based all the other meditation centers charge their clientele a crazy sum just to attend their retreats

[11/21/23, 3:35:02 PM] Val Lapidus: The DAO should maintain the relationship with the coop
[11/21/23, 3:35:41 PM] Val Lapidus: So that if someone wants to go outside the DAO and purchase they need to find a way to create the relationship
[11/21/23, 3:37:02 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s play the devils advocate.

Supposed we have you (a DAO member) introduced to the coop and you have visited the coop, you right now have the relationship 

Why would you not want to go renegade but instead want to continue incurring the overhead that the DAO charges on each transaction 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/23, 3:38:06 PM] Val Lapidus: Because I believe in the DAO.  People who manage the relationship with the co-op need to be trusted members of the dao
[11/21/23, 3:39:35 PM] Gary Teh: So basically DAO members helping maintain the relationship with the coops need to strongly align with the core values, purpose and mission of the DAO? 

Fair enough 

We need to really filter for these qualities during new DAO member interviews ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/23, 3:41:06 PM] Gary Teh: The first thing that Ray immediately identified when he understood how the model works is that there needs to be a high level of trust amongst members within our DAO

Reminds me of all the times I was on the receiving end of this statement “_WTF Gary!?! That is the stupidest idea I have ever heard. Where the f**k is your common sense!?!_”

Then lo and behold, 5 years down the road some variant of that Outrageous idea became the new norm… 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

Another fellow student here at the zen center builds large scale solar farms for her work

[11/26/23, 3:42:17 PM] Gary Teh: Something I observed about the way work is structured around these work session teams at the Zen monastery I have been studying these past few days

*_simplicity*_
The task at each position is simple and well defined. Which allows easy build up of muscle memory after 3-4 iteration by a person executing that the role

Also the number of roles are very very limited since the overall scope of operations was deliberately kept to a minimal as is the signature characteristic of Zen inspired designs 

*_ease of role switching*_
Since these roles are designed to be simple, anyone could easily swap in and swap out of those roles (_which happens on a weekly basis_). 

This also makes it possible for a guest student who has just joined the community for a 2 week period to quickly get into the hang of any assigned role after 2-3 days and start being productive by day 4

*_pairing*_
Someone more experienced in a role is paired with someone new to a role. 

I have observed similar process before in engineering teams called _pair programming_ where an engineer more experienced with a codebase is paired up with an incoming engineer that is new to the codebase to quickly onboard the new engineer 

*_redundancy*_
There is a healthy level of redundancy built into the system design. 

7-8 people are loaded into a scope that could be easily handled by 3-4 people ‎<This message was edited>

[11/26/23, 9:12:21 PM] Gary Teh: Well.. seems it’s less intense here than the *_Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat_* which clocks *_10 hours per day*_. 🤣

Based data collected from the past seven days, it is an average of only 5 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day. Plus another 5 hours of meditation while actively attending to simple chores around the temple and the farm.

One thing I am really curious would be to volunteer as a server for one of the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat once I get back to the Bay Area again after my upcoming trip to Davos. 

That will help give first hand knowledge on how the logistic side of Vipassana retreat works (_heard from @14153096839 that no one is allowed to talk there even as a server_) 

And then as a third data point, finally attend the workshop conducted at the Spiritual Science Research Foundation in Goa as recommended by @41765663130 

My hypothesis is in-depth _*qualitative analysis_* of three such system should help provide enough data points to help triangulate at a high level the key components needed for a volunteer based self managing and self sustaining organization. 🤔
[11/26/23, 9:13:30 PM] Gary Teh: With a *in-depth qualitative analysis* of seven such systems, the clusters (_key patterns_) should become very very apparent 🤩

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

This is especially both of you will be very heavily involved on the European side of the supply chain as well as Swiss association matters 

@31641075825 I am asking @41799155602 if the three of us could meet up at his place after me and @41799155602 finished visiting WEF in Jan

[12/2/23, 7:57:06 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 

@19209806391 will be visiting Kenya this year

If USA market is receptive and there is sufficient profit margin that makes it commercially viable for DAO to bring into USA via Agroverse infrastructure, I will pay a visit to your farm to certify it for imports into USA under USA government FDA regulation 🙂🙏

Meanwhile, while waiting for @19209806391 arrive please sort out the following 

   - export permits from Kenya government to leave port

    - source for freighting company that can handle the exporting ‎<This message was edited>

[12/2/23, 8:03:34 AM] Gary Teh: Part of the documentation for getting FDA certified requires that you list the all the steps from harvest to packing before shipping out to USA

[12/7/23, 12:39:38 PM] Gary Teh: *_Observation at the Zen monastery*_

I had the opportunity to study how the *_sangha*_ (_monastic community_) works 

Specific forms occur at recurring specific time of the day, these are those:

    - communal food
    - study time 
    - meditation time 
    - housekeeping time 
    - operating chores 

The only thing that is compulsory for all to engage in is housekeeping 

As for the rest whether the residents all turn up for them it is up to the exercise of their *_autonomy*_

For residents who are keen the schedule is visibly displayed on the way 

I noticed not all monastic residents show all the time for all meditation or study sessions

But since all residents were self selecting they are generally motivated to follow the schedule which is designed to enhance their spiritual practice 

_*How that translates to DAO*_
Feel free to come up with a schedule and a meeting venue 

If DAO members are keen they can turn up 

If DAO members are not keen they don’t need to turn up 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/7/23, 3:45:27 PM] Gary Teh: I am exercising my *Autonomy* by minimizing my FaceTime for now

When I look at my personal historical data collected over the past 12 months, these FaceTime sessions somehow always occur right when US stock market starts trading. 

The personal cost (_disrupted trades amounting to more than USD20K_) of these FaceTime far outweighs the value generated so far 🤔

I conclude asynchronous communication works best for me. 

Also asynchronous communications allows the space for the messenger to deliver the full message and then ample time for me to fully read and contemplate on the message before replying

Finally side observation these past three weeks, when I deliberately step back, it creates the space that allows other DAO members to step forward. I observed this too as a common practice here in the sangha ‎<This message was edited>

[12/9/23, 5:36:50 AM] Gary Teh: The key characteristics of *_compassion*_ is the person who is triggered to action must also have had suffered in the same way as the other that is being observed. 

It is thus not *_sympathy*_ but *_empathy*_ 

*_Sympathy*_: I have never experienced your type of suffering. I don’t really feel how you are feeling. I am just doing a donation right now just to feel good about myself. 

*_Empathy*_: I have been through that same type of suffering and I know how painful it is. I can feel it right now myself just by seeing your suffering. I am naturally triggered to stop the pain. 

You are experiencing the physical pain. We are both experiencing the psychology pain.

In hindsight, the _*10 day silent mediation retreat*_ was a training module on the *_practical side*_ to observe how the mind body phenomena works 

Whereas, the *_21 day zen training*_ was a training module on the *_theory side*_ to understand why i observed what was observed during the practical lesson ‎<This message was edited>
[12/9/23, 6:00:59 AM] Gary Teh: Bodhisattva is actually two words combined into one

Bodhi and Sattva 

Where translated into English 

Bodhi = Awaken/Enlightened
Sattva = Warrior

@436608133615 these might be elements that you want to consider to incorporate for your *_encrypted gods*_ game design as well 

It becomes more and more fascinating as I dive deeper into this 2500 year old literature and unpack it ‎<This message was edited>

Rather than attempt to sell it perhaps just order as much as possible and then store them somewhere in our decentralized warehousing facility  

Buyers will come knocking on the door at some point when they realize our prices have became competitive just because of market price changes

Then we can start offloading the cacao from our network of warehouses

DAO members get compensated for storage 

Based on my understanding from the folks from the cooperative, Cacao butter can technically be store forever 

Also an active sales team is no longer needed. We just need yo find more folks who are keen to offer their place for cacao storage purposes ‎<This message was edited>

_PS: I was thinking if everyone in the DAO migrated over to the House of Balance there would technically be no further need to maintain TrueSight DAO or any of its channels_

_the values are quite aligned though the set of activities pursued are somewhat different_

_So long as no attempt is made to pursue any commercial enterprises, there is technically no need to maintain the tokens if everything is gift and donation based._

_At some point, we should even consider donating what is left of our USDT treasury to the community events they seek to organize once a year_ ‎<This message was edited>

From my perspective, if we don’t find channel partners for this effort during our upcoming visit to Davos then I really don’t know why I am trading precious time that could be spent having a reunion dinner with my dearly loved ones in Singapore attending something that doesn’t really drive any of our DAO’s projects forward 🙂🙏

[12/12/23, 10:35:24 AM] Gary Teh: DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them. 

_*Laymen terms*_
_I spend 1 million dollars to save rainforest. Rainforest is still dying. I feel very demotivated_

_I spend 1 dollar to save rainforest, a huge section got restored. I feel very motivated_ ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 11:58:35 AM] Gary Teh: My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 2:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: Negative statements are more *qualifiers* than they are *action rules*. 


_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples 


_scenario with qualifer and actual action associated_

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree. 

- *key action*: gather apples from apple trees in garden 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck the blue apples ‎<This message was edited>
[12/13/23, 5:15:06 PM] Gary Teh: Spent past 4 hours creating Python script to automate scoring of Member submissions into WhatsApp channels utilizing OpenAi

_*Location of code base*_
- https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/contribution_scoring/blob/main/Sandbox.ipynb



_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQg09aFTlyUNez3w1GHX4GCQ6b1P3jaUz52z29TUHcw/edit#gid=2120247626



_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels
[12/13/23, 6:09:42 PM] Gary Teh: _thoughts for some far fetched future_

What will be interesting at some point would be to notarize all these submission records on to our own TrueChain (_Proof of Authority based EVM variant_) 

Records to be tokenized will be approved by one of the *_10 Governors*_ system appointed each season. There will be a user interface provided where governors can indicate their approval

Once governor indicates approval, TDG tokens on TrueChain will be automatically issued to DAO member’s Metamask wallet address on file 

DAO member can opt to keep their TDG holdings on TrueChain or request for DAO to have their TDG holdings transferred to either the Solana or Ethereum chain

*Integrity* of DAO will evolve to become crowd sourced amongst DAO members and enabled using AI.

[12/19/23, 11:40:50 PM] Gary Teh: Maybe we could just do a quick simple experiment on the behavior. 

Let’s just propose for millennial farmer friends of yours who plant new trees on their property, to take a photo of the new tree they planted and then emailed the photo to support@agroverse.shop. If they do, they will be awarded governance tokens in our DAO.

That is the minimal action that we should verify can be easily adopted.

Their action will by default provide us with the following details

- email address of farmer
- ⁠Date time stamp (embedded in email header)
- GPS location of tree (embedded in photo attachment)

[12/19/23, 11:50:57 PM] Gary Teh: Later on when we have an AI listening in on a WhatsApp channel, we could have the behavior even more seamless, they could just text the photos to the WhatsApp phone number associated with the AI. Once they do, the scoring gets automated.
[12/20/23, 12:00:34 AM] Gary Teh: Based according to the principles of the @120363044542957540@g.us , Users should not be forced to behave any differently from how they already are right now 

However what happens in the background should be quietly shifted over to the new paradigm without the need of their awareness

Reminds me of this Zen proverb: “_Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water._

_After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water_.” 

Examined using the naked eye nothing has changed 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/20/23, 6:36:43 AM] Gary Teh: If and When they plant new trees on their farm, would they be keen to take a photo of the new tree they planted and then emailed the photo to support@agroverse.shop. If they do, they will be awarded governance tokens in our DAO.
[12/20/23, 9:20:35 AM] Gary Teh: Had a 10 minutes chat with @16468233438 just now

He has been calling up the chocolatiers in the USA 

Seems their minimal order quantity is 100KG and their price point is nothing more than USD6 per kg 

We been reexamining the cost components of our supply chain

Seems we are paying a lot more for freighting than we are for the cacao itself 

The freighting is still using diesel which is not very environmentally friendly supply chain wise 

@16468233438 floated the idea of perhaps owning our own ship. 

@41765663130 mentioned he is planning to sail the carribeans end of January and then head over to Columbia to visit the indigenous 

Wind powered transportation is definitely very eco friendly 🤔

Seems the universe is surfacing some really interesting signals again 🤩

[12/24/23, 3:13:40 AM] Dr. Denis: Even „climate apocalypse“ zealots are against carbon credits because they think that those credits divert money from their dubious „climate actions“ 😅 Besides, it has been known for many years that voluntary carbon credits is just a greenwashing scam by design because they fail to meet additionality criteria

[12/24/23, 6:33:50 AM] Gary Teh: Very insightful article. Thank you for sharing 🙂🙏 

It suggests redirecting resources to support indigenous and farmers as an alternative 

And for companies to start focus on actually cutting emissions instead of planting trees to get more credits (_*green washing*_) ‎<This message was edited>
[12/24/23, 7:00:22 AM] Dr. Denis: Excatly! it's not only this article, but all people who are familiar with carbon trading mechanisms are calling to stop greenwashing with fake voluntary carbon offsets. This publication is even more informative  https://phys.org/news/2023-10-carbon-capture-tree-plantations-threaten-tropical.html
[12/24/23, 7:58:32 AM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 

Large scale tree planting initiatives for carbon capture purposes often *_disrupt the existing biodiversity*_ in the ecosystem where they are planted 

*_Diversity*_ is one of our core values
[12/24/23, 8:48:06 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 spent 30 minutes explaining the USSD protocol that is popular amongst Kenyans as opposed to mobile applications 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data

Cost of the following types of trees saplings 

_We have nurseries that do the grafting and nurturing where we make our purchases_.

- Macadamia - 300 kes
- Avocado - 350-450 kes
- Wambugu apple - 1000 kes
- Peach - 10000kes

_All fruit trees come with different prices._
[12/24/23, 8:49:15 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 spent an hour gathering the following information for @120363044028036610@g.us for macadamia nuts 

I am sorry for sharing this in your inbox, it is too much for the hall.


From farmers, the prices have been varying from 80kes to 100kes per kg of the raw product. I will share a photo from our farm.

However, depending on the level of value addition the bags in supermarkets go for 600kes to over 800kes for 250grams. This value add is typically roasting and salting.

For the very premium ones, they go for as high as 250 kes for 30grams.

I will share some photos below.

I requested a quote from an epz that does the cracking of the nuts in tonnes. I am waiting for their response.

[12/27/23, 9:01:11 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Town hall was a spin off to ensure important message were not lost when Peter Peng was still active in DAO and was flooding Beer Hall with messages about his Ukrainian girl friend and weapons collection. Since he has left noise level has dropped
‎OPTION: Shutdown Townhall and merge all communications and voting into beer hall… (3 votes)
‎OPTION: Keep Townhall for god knows what reason… as purpose is becoming vague (4 votes)
[12/27/23, 9:25:50 PM] Jonathan: you could have one more option which was invite Peter Peng back in so we can hear about his Ukrainian girlfriend again.
[12/27/23, 9:44:42 PM] Gary Teh: He left of his own accord 🤷‍♂️

I would have enjoyed the back and forth between him and @6590995199 

Anyways he seems too busy with his GptProtocol project which is going quite well 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 9:58:07 PM] Gary Teh: I am noticing a recurring pattern… 

ideas and discussions happening in DAO being taken and incorporated into members own independent project 

The most recent one that got surfaced by @41799155602 this morning was by Satheesh (the Ahan project) which borrowed from RnD materials done in Agroverse. The Ahan deck was sent to @41799155602 for fund raising purposes. 

Until @41799155602 surfaced this, I had no idea Satheesh was approaching supporters of Agroverse project to seek financing for an alternate project that had borrowed RnD materials from Agroverse.

This copy and paste phenomena seems to be common in the realms of open source too

_PS: at this point, I am leaning towards being skeptical about the DAO model as a *equitable way* to crowd source for resource to build community projects as the same flaws which exist in open source software operating models are starting to surface in DAO ecosystem as well_

_microsoft for years have been copying and pasting code created in open source projects to build up their OS. Bulk of the market capitalization ended up getting attributed to Microsoft and none of it ever end up getting attributed to these open source efforts_

_as @5511982667030 correctly identified DAO seems to be like a leaky bucket in terms of value generation and capture… value is generated by collective effort but seems to keep getting captured elsewhere_

_I am right now holding off on pouring more personal resources into this leaky bucket until a better alternate variant is discovered…_

_at least it is good to discover a model that doesn’t really work well. This helps us free resources to figure out other models that might work 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 10:23:47 PM] Gary Teh: If I was a hustler the way I would exploit this network would be to download the entire member contact list and then reach out to every single one of them individually to help  finance my own project… the common term for this phenomena is called “_contacts mining_” as described by @41799155602

However since bulk of the folks here were invited by me into our DAO from my personal network, there is technically no one new for me to *_social mine*_ 🤣 

So whether this DAO continue to exist or not doesn’t really matter for me from a networking perspective as my personal relationship with everyone here will still continue existing regardless 🤔

I think the primary reason for this persistence is I did spent ample time to really know each and every person here as a human being. 🙂🙏

I feel it’s important we learn to stop just treating the next person beside us as just another tool. 

What I observed these three months crashing into some of the networking events in Bay Area just makes me cringe as a human being. 😵 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 11:29:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: lol he is a waste of time
[12/27/23, 11:57:47 PM] Vlatko Gigov: This usually happens when you practice maximum transparency. Which has been the case with the DAO since the beginning. It is fine if we are here to support one another and produce spin offs through our participation and chit chat. @5511982667030 rightly points to the leaky bucket analogy. I guess one needs the validation of 100s of ppl to go off on a tangent. Which is again fine. As long as the initial values are preserved. Usually in the begging values are instilled either with an iron fist or a legal bind. Let’s see if we can instil them the hippie way.
[12/28/23, 12:01:31 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The vote surfaced is fine, but I think there should be a task force which works on operations and only reports major milestones to the larger group and addresses the group when there is decisional crossroad.
[12/28/23, 12:02:11 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Of course @14153000019‘s posting doesn’t apply in this restriction, but it does need to be modified a little bit.
[12/28/23, 12:03:35 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The projects being developed here are addressing current problems and sometimes similarities are apparent.
[12/28/23, 12:04:08 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s see what the collective wisdom of this multi year exercise provides as a solution to this apparent problem.

[12/29/23, 4:09:23 PM] Gary Teh: Spoke with Angela (_center of photo_) just now while driving her to the gem wholesaler in my car

She handmakes these marijuana pipes that she sells to the weed shops here for a very high margin

She doesn’t want to waste her time hand making them but doesn’t feel confident about finding a supplier that could do it in China that she could trust

I mentioned that I might be popping by China and know a bunch of folks there sometime this year (@8618926086648… _wink wink_…) and we could source for the manufacturer

Might actually pop by to source for a Kraft pouch printing supplier based in China if @120363044028036610@g.us sales volume does go up (_at some point_) 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

Spent bulk of today exploring the world’s largest wholesale precious gem fair! 🤩

And it’s totally amazing!! Also managed to bump into an ex-Olympic USA swimmer. She mentioned she will be in Paris to volunteer at the swimming event during summer this year! 

Time spent: 4 hours 

Key insights 

- each spot on the open desert rents for 15 days 

- ⁠renting period officially begins 1 January and last through to February 

- ⁠none precious gen vendors set up as early as October 

- ⁠USA precious gem miners typical work 11 months in a year mining the land they have contracted with state and county until weather turns ultra bad before they seek refuge here in QuartzSite

- ⁠retail price is typically a 100% markup on whole sale price

- ⁠other places where precious gem are sourced from: China, Brazil, Uruguay and Afghanistan

_PS: The new tokenization process aided by ChatGpt has really helped save time. Typical tokenization time has shorted from around 5 hours per channel to just 1 hour. Once we all start follow the convention of reporting time taken and task completed, human verification time and effort will be further reduced_

[1/3/24, 12:13:19 PM] Gary Teh: Message from Ray Wu.

_My friend Michael Michelini (based in Chiangmai) has been in eCommerce for years and runs Cross Border Summit. I met him in China years ago._

_He's currently working on loadpipe.com - which is selling on the blockchain. I mentioned your DAO to him. Would you be open to connecting with him? https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemichelini/?originalSubdomain=_

Time take for introduction by him 1 hour

_PS: seems once DAO network achieved some level of critical mass it just ends up self perpetuating_

_at some point, my best form of the contribution is to not get in the way by practicing *Do Nothing* in the @120363044542957540@g.us 🤩🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

‎[1/3/24, 12:20:28 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Sales Pitch Deck 2023 (2).pdf • ‎22 pages ‎document omitted
[1/3/24, 12:28:07 PM] Gary Teh: Could you also help clarify which of the listed  value add is in the sales deck is available with the *_USDT3000 and TDG3000 package_* you proposed? 

That way DAO members can have better clarity and ask more questions in case of doubts 🙂🙏
[1/3/24, 12:38:45 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: @14153000019 Yes well it would be a custom package. It woul be the standard package plus some additional add ons such as AMA, web and mobile banners, inclusion in the newsletter. I could also provide as many comarketing activities as you want, the project sets the budget.
[1/3/24, 12:39:39 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Plus the IEO
[1/3/24, 12:42:03 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The total price would be 10k. The upfront cost can be 3000 USDT + 3000 TDG. to be paid before onboarding.The remaing 4k would have to be paid after the IEO and prior to trading paor going live. 

The balance could be in fiat or a combination of fiat and TDG.
[1/3/24, 2:33:08 PM] Gary Teh: Had a 2.5 hours FaceTime with @41799155602 just now to discuss about @120363044028036610@g.us @120363045796860099@g.us as well as the Swiss non-profit association to house TrueSight DAO just now 

@31641075825 and @41799155602 will meet up tomorrow CET time to work on the deck which we will be using for @120363044028036610@g.us when I arrive in Davos 🙂🙏

[1/3/24, 2:38:13 PM] Vlatko Gigov: @447507059473 pleasure to meet. how many users does the newsletter reach? Out of the number how many of them are investing in IEO’s (conversion rate average)? For the AMA, what is the usual attendance for previous projects? 🙏
[1/3/24, 2:47:36 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes chatting with the real estate agent regarding this *2.5 acre plot* of land in the desert which cost *USD3,200* and is in the *_flood zone*_🤯

_*My interpretation*: Desert + tons of water = an anomaly that presents an interesting opportunity 🤩_

Will pop by to pay it a visit over the weekend 

If it’s good, will close the deal with the agent before I leave for Davos Switzerland on the 11th of Jan, so that we can have a playground to experiment with for @120363045796860099@g.us 

_PS: the agent seem concerned about my safety. And asked that I informed prior to my visit as well as after my visit so that I made it out alive from the patch of land… somehow this has increasingly become a recurring theme lately… 🤔🤣_ ‎<This message was edited>

My sense is simply lace as many sales and marketing channels as possible on to this and see where the conversion rate actually happens
[1/5/24, 1:39:19 AM] Iwona Fluda: Because, it is beer hall, some news here:
The book: Activate Your Life, Vol. 4 for which I wrote a chapter, 'Creative Bites: The Dance of Ideas, Sky, and Trust,' along with other authors, has just hit the bestseller lists on Amazon. Still just today you can download the kindle version of this book and 3 previous volumes for free. 🌟

[1/5/24, 8:05:51 PM] Gary Teh: Now that we have established market price for our (_freely available_) clay supply, this becomes really interesting 🤔🤩

We could technically start backing our governance tokens with clay which technically has an indefinite storage period compared to organic materials like cacao and we technically don’t even need to worry about people stealing our clay since there are tons of those where those came from. 🤩

Also since the whole site is full of trash, no one will every want to develope the land for commercial purposes because government ordinance  require that they spend millions of dollars cleaning up the trash (_accumulated over 50 years 🤯_) before they are even allowed to ever build anything on it..  😱

Everytime we sell this freely available commodity on Amazon or to one of our distributors our fiat deposit increases. And our supply is technically protected by the U.S. government 🤔🤣

[1/8/24, 7:39:18 AM] Iwona Fluda: Hi everyone! I've established several media partnerships with organizations during the Davos week, including with the Climate Hub: https://creativeswitzerland.com/climate-hub-davos-x-creative-switzerland/. If you're interested in being featured across our diverse media channels and gaining access to an international audience, please feel free to reach out. This is a unique opportunity to showcase your organization and initiatives and connect with a global network. Looking forward to potentially collaborating with you! Cheers & see you in Davos!

P.S. For one of the events, I also created digital art pieces to be visible on their screen, if you would like to discover more about it and consider it for your events, have a look here: https://creativeswitzerland.com/creative-bites-digital-art-by-iwona-fluda/  

You can also find me on Linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fluda/

[1/8/24, 7:42:47 AM] Gary Teh: Very very cool! Perhaps feature Agroverse cacao nibs and how this effort attempts to help regenerate our Atlantic rainforest 🙂🙏

@41799155602 @41765663130 @41765737357 and myself will be there

@120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs will be shared at Davos

Let’s just test with the prevailing starting price on her and then offload at close of cost price 

From my perspective doesn’t really matter so long as we recoup our initial cost for AGL2

I remember easily fitting 5KG of cacao nibs into my backpack last year and then bringing it back into USA from Brazil as a commercial entry

- ⁠the only similarity is the drinking of the cacao
- ⁠Tibetan singing bowl was used
- ⁠animal skin drum was used

Introduction was made by Yarrow from Hatch. Member of the house of balance.

[1/14/24, 10:33:12 AM] Gary Teh: Bhavana further elaborated on getting to oneness (_Seva - proper mental frame to be in when contributing in DAO_)

Self (1) + Divinity, aka choiceless awareness (1) = 2 

To get to 1 one of the two must be removed from the equation 

Not-self, aka Anatta (0) + Divinity, choiceless awareness (1) = 1

When anybody is doing anything make sure Nobody is Doing Nothing

[1/17/24, 5:14:00 AM] Gary Teh: Key insight identified 

- The shipping industry is very old and needs some refactoring 

- ⁠there is so much scam in the shipping industry banks no longer issue letter of credit

[1/18/24, 1:00:54 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The financing portion of the shipping industry is a major problem, one of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed.

[1/19/24, 1:49:53 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 yesterday at the Davos China Day 2024 in the Hari Krishna temple where @41799155602 shared with the investors circle about the following projects:

- ⁠@120363044028036610@g.us 
- ⁠@120363045796860099@g.us 

Time he spent sharing it: 30 minutes 

Seems earth.ship like projects are a common phenomena in his circles 

_PS: everyone went on a spiritual high after that_
‎[1/19/24, 1:50:25 AM] Gary Teh: ‎video omitted
[1/19/24, 2:01:25 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 the day before at the Free Thinker Society where he and I shared about the concerns of the forthcoming @120363044542957540@g.us 

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

We spent 2 hours at the free thinker’s society 

_PS: @41799155602 observed the ripple effect on the dropping of this bomb. Economists independently brought this up during discussions at various panels they are part of_

Time taken: 15 minutes

_PS: first comment director made after hearing this vision was “did you come from the future?”_

_My response “I came from the distant pass from the times of Lao Tzu, Buddha and Diogenes 🤣”_

_The vision of an alternate truly post industrial age decentralized lifestyle configuration that is sustainable and aligned with nature was a very thought provoking idea that drove a lot of curious people to approach thereafter_

_a Neo-hunter gathering lifestyle that is back by newly available technologies like solar panels, AI, IOT and blockchain mixed with traces of esoteric paganism_ ‎<This message was edited>

[1/19/24, 6:35:45 AM] Gary Teh: There seems to be real opportunity to do the Whole 9 yards, from growing, sourcing, shipping, distributing and selling 🤩🙏
[1/19/24, 7:11:16 AM] Gary Teh: *_Observations made while aimlessly drifting through Davos_*:

Unacquainted strangers who made initial contact when presented with the same story (_stimulus_) either respond one way or the other 

- less and less excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠more and more excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠folks involved in the crypto space visibly recoil as though just presented with a venomous snake after being presented with the keyword _DAO_ if and when they decide to pry further beyond the _Do Nothing_ stage of the story 

_Story_
- I Do Nothing but sometimes when the Calling to do so comes I contribute to projects managed and operated by a DAO

_Distinctive demographic differences_

- subjects who become less and less excited tend to be dressed in formal suits 

- ⁠subjects who grow more and more excited tend to be dressed in casual wear. Further observed is the more esoteric their garment looks the more rapid the rate by which they get excited 

Time taken to conduct this social experiment was 3 hours ‎<This message was edited>
[1/19/24, 7:15:42 AM] Gary Teh: Interpretation of signals 

- there is a community of people actively committed to _Seva (Do Nothing)_

- ⁠as more and more people awaken to the general meaninglessness their existing vocation, they start committing to _Seva (Do Nothing)_ ‎<This message was edited>
[1/20/24, 2:44:49 AM] Gary Teh: Gifted a bag of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs to @41765663130 this morning for playing host this week 

He mentioned he might know someone that supplies cacao to the smaller choclate makers here in Switzerland 

I proposed for him and @41799155602 to have a chat as @41799155602 is overseeing the supply chain into Europe 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/20/24, 2:57:13 AM] Gary Teh: Had a dinner yesterday evening and breakfast this morning with @41765663130 and friends here in Davos where we discussed about @120363044028036610@g.us and @120363045796860099@g.us 

They mentioned they would be happy to make introductions when I arrived along the west coast of Africa where cacao is being cultivated. 

@120363045796860099@g.us has been particularly intriguing amongst friends as it was immediately labeled as an Elon Musk category project. 

these were the general themes surfaced during discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

[1/20/24, 3:02:28 AM] Gary Teh: Had one hour lunch with @41799155602 and friends at the Temple yesterday where discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us organically happened

_ideas surfaced_

- 3D printing using waste materials 

- ⁠solar powered 3D printing of construction materials 

- ⁠solar powered desalination of sea water

- ⁠there are lots of plastic (_construction material_) floating around in the ocean and they are naturally clustered together (_easy harvesting_) ‎<This message was edited>

_Key insights_

- it is possible to have *Integrity* (_core value_) without need for Transparency (_not core value_)

_Follow up action_

- future useful insights gathered that are not tokenizable will no longer be shared within these channels (_DM me if you are keen to find out where the category of untokenized  insights are published and shared_)

- ⁠this will further reduce the amount of post within our WhatsApp channels 

- ⁠if two or more DAO members are present, visual submissions will no longer be a requirement to prove that DAO contribution has transpired 

- ⁠Governors retain the right to request for proof when in doubt

[1/20/24, 4:10:36 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Finally we have come to the realisation of intentions. Looking forward to the upgrade of TSD. The governance model is evolving and DAO and TAO are gaining more and more traction the right way. “Train your psyche”
[1/22/24, 8:55:02 AM] Gary Teh: *discussion for the week*

what are your thoughts on the China wobbling economy on activities within our DAO? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/22/24, 9:01:48 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Very interesting question, I’m eager to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from people in that part of the world. Not an expert on Chinese economics. I only come across so much made in China stuff as i am sure you all do. Do we need all that? 🤔
[1/23/24, 3:14:46 AM] Alessandro Mele: Indeed really interesting question. I guess it depends on our exposure to the Chinese economy : do we have any members living there who might be affected? How do they see the situation and it’s impact on their lives? And do we have any partner or supply chain exposure there? There might be repercussions on the cost of supplies for instance or a reduction in sales from clients in the region. The fact that our DAO is a fairly small and agile organisation should make us resilient and flexible to adapt to chancing macroeconomic situations.
[1/23/24, 5:13:06 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Indeed. Looking at it from a macro perspective and how the majority of synthetic/petrochemicals products/by products come from China, the supply chain aspect will be affected. China could end up raising prices, to fill up the coffers. Leaving room for the cradle to cradle circular economy aspect to gain traction @41765737357 is an expert in c2c field. Very strong in the recycled packaging field. Might be interesting to explore partners in China who will adopt these practices… 

And of course when you throw the US in there as their best econ partner we could partially predict what’s going to come as long as we stay on the sustainability agenda. Let’s see what happens. It’s an election year across majority of the countries.
[1/23/24, 9:38:09 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Well, it is actually key to concern material health (safety) before recycling. It needs some innovations in materials…

[1/24/24, 9:13:36 AM] Gary Teh: @14152023011 could you share the performance of your automated crypto-currency trading strategy since  its inception 

Please list the following
- sharpe ratio
- ⁠largest drawdown
- ⁠time to recovery since largest drawdown 
- ⁠period in months fund has been running

Post LATOKENs listing in the very short run, we might end up having more liquidity that we could deploy for project build up purposes. It might make sense to deploy a small portion of the liquidity to be managed by your bot if the 4 parameters being inspected are up to par with our DAO’s requirements 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/24/24, 3:29:35 PM] Gary Teh: Me and @41799155602 spent 2 hour this evening doing a survey of cacao prices at the various supermarket chains here in Basel

[1/28/24, 3:51:03 AM] Minahil Alvi: Hello Everyone 👋 @14153000019 I’m currently working at the intersection of AI & Blockchain in the Education Landscape. Super passionate about Circular economy, Environmental stewardship, and All things Deep Technology at Large.
[1/28/24, 3:56:29 AM] Minahil Alvi: Currently reading the Truesight DAO white paper. Fascinated with the community, would love to learn from fellow community members and engage in discussions, ideas and opportunities
[1/28/24, 3:56:48 AM] Gary Teh: What are some key challenges you observe within these domains that you have listed which you are actively working on to discover solutions to tackle right now 🙂
[1/28/24, 4:03:38 AM] Minahil Alvi: Education is my current focus at the moment. With the Advent of AI, Education and the democratization of skills will greatly impact global economies. To tackle the upcoming challenge/opportunity. I have devoted the past couple of months to the inception of a platform called Tutorwith.ai - which helps Educators and Legacy Education Institutes utilize AI to create a more personalized learning experience for students and cut out the learning curve for millions of teachers worldwide.
[1/28/24, 4:07:13 AM] Gary Teh: What are some key challenges you encountered when applying AI towards the creation of personalized learning experiences for students? 🙂
[1/28/24, 4:16:15 AM] Minahil Alvi: The challenge actually starts with the teachers - In the Middle East specifically the average teacher spends 20 to 30 percent of their daily classroom time doing admin tasks such as (Lesson planning, student reports, Subject specific materials, etc) Tutorwith.ai automates these tasks leaving room for a more personalized educational experience. We are in the MVP stage of our platform and until now the feedback from teachers and educators has been overwhelmingly positive, indicating the importance of our mission and vision. (In short, the challenge we are anticipating might be on the adoption side of such a tool in the wider educational landscape)
[1/28/24, 4:17:40 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Quite fortunate that we have renowned experts in edu platforms in the beer hall! 💫

[1/30/24, 11:22:06 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes just now chatting with @554792591729 explaining how members can contribute their time to DAO project in exchange for TDG tokens now that it is in the process of getting listed on the LATOKEN exchange

[1/31/24, 6:21:20 AM] Anupa/diya: @554792591729 it is lightly explained on the current website. Maybe we can do a detailed version 

The contribution list will vary from project to project.
[1/31/24, 6:22:33 AM] Anupa/diya: We will have to simply the explanation for the non web 3 members. We will need to add that as well
[1/31/24, 9:34:06 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: sure, The IEO or initial exchange offering is a way to offer the token to early investors/traders. It is similar to a presale or ICO but it is done on the exchange.The price during the ICO is usually at a discount to the public sale price to reward early participants.It also allows projects to raise funds by selling a % of the token supply. It must be noted however that the exchange can't guarantee of how much funds may be raised.It is also used to market promote and create awareness of the project. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/31/24, 9:36:23 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The listing going live on the other hand would be setting up a trading pair on the exchange and make trading on the exchange possible right away.The listing will also include promotional campaigns to drive token adoption and community growth.
[1/31/24, 10:26:39 AM] Gary Teh: Based on the policy voted into effect, we are just planning to release 200,000 TDG for sale this IEO and listing 

All DAO members are already contributing at 1USD = 1TDG

What are your thoughts if we just made the token price at IEO to be the same rate and then thereafter allow market to decide what rate they want the prevailing TDG/USDT exchange rate to be at? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/31/24, 10:38:48 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The market will eventually decide the rate, but there has to a price for the initial listing to have a starting point. After the first initial trades the price will be determined by market sentiment. I think a better way to do it is set whatever price you want the listing to be and have the IEO be at a discounted price, So an example could be to set the listing price at 1USD per TDG. Prior to the listing IEO participants can be given the chance to by at $0.80/TDG. Have a cap on the IEO say 75% of allocated tokens.The remaining tokens can be used for co-marketing activities and the liquidity for the trading pair. The trading pair can be opened with as little as $250TDG/$250USDT but the more liquidity the lower the less volatile the price will be and have better spreads on the buys/asks
[1/31/24, 10:44:14 AM] Gary Teh: I see

It might make sense to do the following

Pricing
- IEO at $1/TDG 
- ⁠list at $1.5/TDG 

Allocation volume 
- 150,000TDG for allocated IEO
- 50,000TDG allocated for release during listing time 

Anyone else have thoughts about this?
[1/31/24, 10:44:40 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Thise numbers are just for ilustration
[1/31/24, 10:45:08 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: We would speak with the account manager and finalize the numbers,

[2/2/24, 3:44:48 PM] Gary Teh: As previously shared during Davos at the Hari Krishna temple, when I last did the math, 20ft container worth of mushroom basically yields around USD2 million every 3 months. If distributing wholesale, it’s around USd1 million every 3 months per 20ft container

We don’t really need much upfront investment. Just need to get a plot of land to setup the initial prototype 

Snowballing of the revenue from that will help scale the infrastructure. It’s basically another marketing and distribution problem ‎<This message was edited>

[2/3/24, 8:42:22 AM] Gary Teh: @447507059473 you might want to adjust this term before you get into trouble with your boss

The second USDT3000 is contingent on IEO raising more than that amount otherwise, there is no recourse on you receiving that amount from the DAO since all the DAO members will just become permanent residents in the @120363044542957540@g.us beyond that point and really Do Nothing 🙂🙏

A more feasible term would be up to USDt3000 contingent on the USDt amount being raised during IEO and the balance in TDG. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/6/24, 3:50:02 PM] Gary Teh: What synchronicity!?! 🤩

Was chatting with a close friend based in Shanghai to get a sense of how bad the economy in China was just now so as to figure how much of the dirt cheap assets to be considered for collection as the country goes into shit 💩😱

Didn’t realize she recently got into regenerative energy sector as well 

She has proposed to take the entire round of financing needs for @120363045796860099@g.us… as usual, she complained the required capital outlay is peanuts!?! 🤷‍♂️🤣

She even proposed to supply  second hand solar panels for sale in USA if interested via our @120363044028036610@g.us Amazon account  🤩

[2/7/24, 9:56:02 AM] Gary Teh: Greetings. I have been involved with a DAO based organisation called United Religions Initiative since 2008 and it was founded in 2000. For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this. It is the Proof of Point of DAO which is now 24 years old
[2/7/24, 9:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.
[2/7/24, 9:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: here is a snapshot of this framework, which can be transferred to out movements as well. Many others started out with same methodology, but only the URI survived 2008 and beyond to make a proof of point

_Discussed_
- Green Up is a non-profit Swiss association
- ⁠Explored how Green Up operates projects and events in Switzerland
- ⁠One of the most popular workshop offered by Green Up to cooperations is how to live simply
- ⁠how foundations that provide financing to Green Up projects work

potential areas for interfacing
- Green Up has done a bunch of research on living simply and soil restoration. We could potentially utilize the research materials to identify prototypes we want to test and implement for testing in the SunMint Project. Those that we have tested to work in our SunMint project we can then compile as a handbook that Green Up could use in their workshops
- We could learn from operating processes that Green Up follows when running volunteer based events
- ⁠There has been a bunch of folks in our DAO that have proposed that I write a book at some point. I think the most useful book I could probably come up with right now is basically a blueprint that people can follow to implement the minimal carbon footprint off-grid setup I have right now. I will contribute that as materials to the workshop that Green Up workshop
- ⁠Foundations that Green Up is in communications with in Switzerland that are associated retailing distribution would be helpful for distributing Agroverse produce growing using environmentally restorative techniques. We should support the farmers ‎<This message was edited>

‎[2/15/24, 5:29:14 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: TrueSight DAO Governance_order_form_15_02_2024.pdf • ‎7 pages ‎document omitted
[2/15/24, 5:29:57 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity—facilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.
[2/15/24, 6:32:12 AM] Gary Teh: Could you indicate how much USDT and TDG it will be in total for listing. The agreement doesn’t indicate any of the amount 🙂🙏

[2/15/24, 9:22:31 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hi yes I will include that on the final doc. So in total it will be 50% of the total cost in USDT or $5,000. The other 50% in TDG $5,000 of TDG

60% will have to be paid before the IEO and the remaining 40%a fter the IEO before trading pair goes live.
[2/15/24, 9:32:03 AM] Gary Teh: We are short of USDT2000 with only USDT3000 in vault

[2/17/24, 4:15:48 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes today making cacao with my moka pot and sharing about the story of @120363044028036610@g.us

Been fining tuning the story telling as well as the format for consuming it in a social setting⁩ 

_Heal the World with Love!_ seems to be a recurring theme even amongst nomads 🤩🙏

Please help us understand your train of thought 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/19/24, 9:48:00 PM] Anupa/diya: I am guessing all projects are sub Daos under the main DAO. This conversation goes back to our initial conversation of how sub bodies will function

If one can figure out the purpose of what is being built to the these existing structures that a strategy can be under what kind of Sub DAO so its is easier for  on
[2/19/24, 9:48:00 PM] Anupa/diya: Funding support
[2/19/24, 9:52:19 PM] Gary Teh: Could you further elaborate on how you see sub-DAOs could function that is different  from how it is currently indicated in the constitution? 🙂🙏
[2/19/24, 9:52:45 PM] Anupa/diya: Didn't we have this documented so where
[2/19/24, 9:53:06 PM] Anupa/diya: We will need this for edgar has well
[2/19/24, 9:54:00 PM] Gary Teh: It’s in the white paper 🙂🙏

[2/22/24, 9:10:19 AM] Anupa/diya: This is our first Edgar revamp Meeting. We brainstormed around the idea of financial literary and education. We also agreed that there is a definite need make people ( users still to be identified) more financial resilient for the future. There is a gap in the way people manage and build wealth and have less liabilities. It is something that fiat and crypto communities. If anyone is interested to know more about what we aim to do and want to join. Dm me or any one on the pic or @41799155602.

[2/22/24, 9:36:41 AM] Anupa/diya: Once the group here are financially flowing .. you can send them over to edgar for wealth management.. cross over 🤣🤣
[2/22/24, 9:21:56 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, it is wonderful you are exercising your personal autonomy by leading the Edgar guild to undertake this initiative 

*_Autonomy*_ is one of our core values

Having someone else lead a guild also owns the window for more *_Diversity*_. 

*_Diversity*_ is another one of our core values

[2/23/24, 8:32:30 AM] Gary Teh: Version one of @120363044028036610@g.us affiliate marketing program is now up and running, we will experiment with onboarding 25 health and environmentally conscious influencers based in USA with between 1,000 and 10,000 followers next 

*The goals*

- to craft a simple script that works which we can then scale to onboard even more influencers. 

- ⁠to figure out the chinks to be ironed out during the onboarding process

[2/25/24, 9:02:37 PM] Gary Teh: Just made arrangements to be vending @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs and perhaps some hot chocolate and mushroom infused chocolate via partnership at Barter Faire in May up in Washington state 

https://youtu.be/VRK6-N-T4wg?si=qQ3UxghE84XMzVuH

Have also spoken with organizer to be onboarding van life influencers while we are there for an overriding commission of subsequent sales by influencers they bring onboard (_guess we are going down the MLM route on the direct to consumer side of the business after all_) 

_PS: Barter Faire is the largest  annual van life event in the entire USA. Spread across 40 acres with 20 acres reserved for vendors (_center camp_) and 20 reserved for visitors (_out skirts_) ‎<This message was edited>
[2/25/24, 10:25:41 PM] Nicole: @14153000019 does Barter mean swap and not sell? Or is it just an overall name. Would be curious
[2/25/24, 10:51:37 PM] Gary Teh: Is just a name 

Nomads might barter amongst themselves but vendors definitely have tables up to straight up sell 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/26/24, 2:07:59 AM] Anupa/diya: @919972392822 Welcome to the Beer Hall. @41799155602 and I really enjoyed chatting with you. Hope you will find many synergies

[2/26/24, 2:23:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Welcome! @918017107841, I and @919972392822 Gitanjali spent 1 hour discussing truesight dao and system design her work is around vibe design. 
Here is more material for TSD where you can dive deeper. Curious to hear your reflections on the materials: https://github.com/TrueSightDAO
[2/26/24, 2:24:07 AM] ~ Gitanjali: Thanks for adding me Anupa.
It was wonderful speaking with you and Vlatko.
Truly thrilled to be a part of this dynamic community.
[2/27/24, 5:19:19 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello good day everyone.

I talked to the approvals team regarding the LATOKEN listing. For a short amount of time I can reduce the final price to 5k from 10 but it would have to be paid in USDT or other equivalent.

The main points are
*Can be listed for 5k total instead of 10k
*Needs to be USD 
*Can pay 3k in advance and 2K after IEO


If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.
[2/28/24, 6:50:04 AM] Gary Teh: Had a 30 minutes chat with Franck and @41799155602 where we chatted about

[3/6/24, 12:08:05 PM] Gary Teh: So far we have reached out to 30 influencers. Averaging around 10 per day.
Influencer positive response rate was around 16%

An influencer who has accumulated a lot of followers based on her weigh loss journey would be someone that is perfect to showcase our cacao nibs. Since that is what alot of folks who follow a Keto diet end up consuming

Someone like influencer who started her weigh loss journey from 300lbs 
https://www.tiktok.com/@avila2680_?shop_region=US
[3/6/24, 4:49:56 PM] Gary Teh: 9 out of the 10 influencers we reached out today is fighting obesity. Some of them already having lost more than 100lb

Something clicked in my head just now when looking through this afternoon’s qualitative signals 

Each physical human body has a configuration range where it’s considered healthy. The body’s consciousness intuitively knows that

Nature does not do anything extraneous. When the body is healthy. It is naturally attractive regardless of biological age. 

These influencers from today’s marketing outreach efforts intuitively know their current configuration is not within the healthy range and trying to restore balance to their internal system 

Gaia (_the universe_) is attempting to restore balance not just in the rainforest but also in the human body ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/24, 5:01:46 PM] Gary Teh: When the world is healed with love, beauty is the by-product 

Consciousness intuitively knows beauty when it beholds it within its field of awareness.

Beauty can exist in the physical body or in the natural environment 

Beauty is a natural indicator of health within an organism as well as the ecosystem.

Consciousness is naturally drawn to love and beauty. ‎<This message was edited>

[3/6/24, 10:33:11 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps might be useful to extend TrueSight dAO website Agroverse project profile to indicate Agroverse has an affiliate program

There are two customer acquisition strategies we are right now testing for @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once each one is validated we plan to scale them by retaining the service of a call center 

That way we can just throw more headcount’s into the outbound saled team using th profit generated as we scale our sales volume. ‎<This message was edited>

Compile me a list with the following 

- company name 
- ⁠url
- ⁠Email address
- ⁠phone number
- ⁠rates
[3/10/24, 8:27:21 AM] Anupa/diya: I dont think rates will be available on google. You will have conduct a few discovery calls to figure that out and to see the  credibility and quality
[3/11/24, 7:52:41 AM] Anupa/diya: Time spent 1 hr
[3/11/24, 7:53:24 AM] Anupa/diya: The most successful one is wipro. I dont know if anyone has any contacts.  Not sure of their pricing and capacity

Up next, I will be reaching out to this same influencers on the list who have not responded to my messages yet. 

This time we do so via email and also track if they have opened and read the email. This will give us some insight on the attractiveness of our CTA (_call to action_) before without them needing to respond to the emails
[3/13/24, 11:57:47 PM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour relooking into Raydium protocol for listing our governance tokens on the OpenBook decentralized exchanges
https://openbook-tools.dexlab.space/market/create

Will hold off on creating the liquidity pool and swap until we have proved that at least one of the following projects are actually generating cash from operations

- Agroverse
- ⁠SunMint

_PS: The ecosystem has been hammered with the collapse of Alameda and FTX. Our original market setup on the Serum protocol was defuncted. We will need to set a new market up again on the OpenBook protocol once we are ready._

_Once setup our DAO can start performing open market buybacks from DAO members who are keen to sell off tokens which they have earned through their contributions_ ‎<This message was edited>
[3/14/24, 12:02:16 AM] Gary Teh: On the positive side, OpenBook protocol is primarily a community driven initiative

Creating the market for our tokens will require 3 SOL. 

We can exchange for SOL using USDT in our vault or USD profits we generated once when they do get generated

Will surface that decision for voting in our @120363111951279022@g.us when the time comes ‎<This message was edited>

A vendor recommended attending this trade show yesterday which happens twice a year

[3/20/24, 11:05:20 AM] Gary Teh: _*Murmurs from the USA cacao market_*

After rounds of feedback gathering that @16468233438 has conducted with the USA chocolatiers, and me with the USA consumers.

The taste of Gourmet cacao is more refined due to the additional care in the processing and thus pricier. 

USA chocolatiers are accustomed to working with the usual bulk cacao supplies and their corresponding price points.

The USA chocolate connoisseur knows quality when she taste it and is willing to pay premium price for it. 

*_Proposed path forward_*
Our mission is to heal the world with love and restore its beauty. In the case of our cacao nibs, restoring our rainforest. So long as we have the opportunity to help further increases the sales and distribution of  agricultural produce grown regeneratively by the farmers, we should go for it.


- Have two product lines targets at the different target segments

- ⁠*Gourmet cacao market segment* - targeted at the direct to premium consumer market segment - cacao ceremonies, medicinal ingredients infused cacao 

- ⁠*Bulk cacao* - targeted at chocolatiers who want to enhance their brand story by supporting our climate change efforts, but don’t want to incur the premium that comes along with the gourmet cacao process.

_PS: This seems to be the norm for other brands I had the opportunity to encounter_ ‎<This message was edited>

[3/22/24, 7:27:20 AM] Gary Teh: *insight from this morning’s 1 hour meditation*

After much curation within my personal network, looking back at 20 years of personal data as well as reading through the biographies of the top organization builders, the most important function within any organization with a commercial intent is *_Marketing (making money 💰💸💵💶💷💴🤑)*_

*_Sources*_
- Ryu - business developer
- ⁠Jerry Luk - President of Fireworks
- ⁠Peter Gwee - DAO member, 3 generation business man in the fenshui industry 
- ⁠Dad - third generation business man in the food distribution industry
- ⁠Vinod Nair - CEO money smart 
- ⁠Richard Brandon 
- ⁠Elon Musk
- ⁠@6598383264 

PS: when the *_marketing (making money)*_ function works wells, the rest of the function will automatically work well of their own accord 

Creators are drawn to a space because they enjoy the process of building a product. 

Paradoxically, to really be successful in a space, creators have to step away from the product development function and focus on the organization building itself and most especially through marketing function.

Creators that have been observed to struggle are those who cling on for too long to the product building instead of letting otters handle it. 

When the marketing function works well and starts bringing in 💴💷💶💵💸🤑, specialists from various functions will naturally get attracted into the organization to support in the other functions ‎<This message was edited>

Given a list of shortlisted TikTok influencer profiles URL, the crawler visits each page and then extracts the email address listed on each influencer’s profile page.

[4/1/24, 1:01:43 PM] Gary Teh: Had a discussion with @918017107841 last month

It does not make sense to allow random cross promotion of projects in our DAO channels

A close analogy is a TikTok employee going into Facebook office in Menlo Park, California and then pasting posters about TikTok products on the walls of Facebook office 

A security guard working for Facebook overseeing the premise will end up recognizing the out of place posters as such (_vandalism_) and then removing them 

A DAO Is decentralized and autonomous in how it governance itself, but at the end of the day it is still an organization. Organization needs to behave like an organization. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Almost makes sense to make this like a community gathering via meetup.com 🤔
[4/3/24, 9:47:53 AM] Gary Teh: We can even provide free food during the meetup.com session using the food we collected via the local food banks

[4/14/24, 7:43:49 PM] Gary Teh: Had this chat @918017107841 this morning regarding the pursuit of market opportunities business development wise

DAO has eyes and ears over the place, spread across six continents to be exact. It’s a really wide net which ends up picking up a lot of opportunities. More opportunities than DAO has resources to pursue

At this point, it makes sense to follow the GE rule

Unless DAO has an unfair advantage that other players in the market niche don’t, and DAO can see a path to end up either the leader or close second in the market niche associated with a market opportunity, we will not deploy our resources to pursue the opportunity

This should further help us focus on where resources should be deployed

This also mean, we will end up saying no to around 99% of the opportunities that come our way ‎<This message was edited>

[4/18/24, 5:07:14 PM] Gary Teh: *Thoughts regarding @120363044028036610@g.us*

_Current value that we need to offer our customers (people who buy from us)_

- underwriting the risk of renegade suppliers

- ⁠verifying suppliers are legitimate and not scammers 

- providing the financing to bring in the shipment 

_Another critical value that we need to offer our customers_

- proper hedging so that our customers do not experience wild price fluctuations and supply shortage which is becoming increasingly critical during this unpredictable phase of climate change

_PS: the farmers are not our customers. While the core purpose of the @120363044028036610@g.us project is to help them help restore our rainforest, at the end of the day, they are still suppliers_ ‎<This message was edited>

we are aligned with the vision of the project. whatever we are going to do out here in the desert is basically R&D for what we will deploy when we colonize the surface of the moon. 

Based on the ongoing conversations he’s been having with the NASA and SpaceX engineers based here in Silicon Valley, we are 5 to 10 years away from moon surface colonization

Decentralized infrastructure is going to be a key aspect of this ecosystem we are building since we should be expecting more and more far-flung colonies in outer space

- ⁠he will setup a minimal viable @120363045796860099@g.us offgrid power facility at his place in Santa Cruz. I just need to ship over a bitcoin miner to run our proof of concept to test the entire end to end before we go for V1 in slab city this coming winter

Met Willow, a shaman who was leading the cacao activation this evening. She ended up buying a pound of cacao. She got really excited when she realized I had with me a new strain of cacao she never had before. 

She also suggested that she needs my help to certify the Ecuador farm that she is currently bringing in cacao from because the import and sales is technically illegal. 

She is a traveling healer diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and only has two and a half years of lifespan left  

*_Recurring patterns observed*_

- healers who specialize in pain management 

- ⁠uses cacao as a gift

- ⁠curious to try more varieties of cacao  

- ⁠female in late forties and early fifties 

- ⁠attends ecstatic dance 

- ⁠there is always an altar at these ecstatic dance sessions dedicated to *_Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva*_ who expounded the *_Heart Sutra*_

- ⁠there seem to be a cultural convergence between the *_Heart Sutra*_ and *_Cacao, medicine of the Heart*_ or some call it Heart resonance

As our DAO gear for our governance tokens IEO, do expect some of our less formal processes regarding token issues and grants to start getting replaced by more formal ones

Also formerly casual tone of communications within DAO channels will start shifting to more formal tone of communications 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[5/13/24, 6:49:41 AM] Gary Teh: Spent two hours yesterday catching up with Sarah here in Portland, Oregon and to discuss the following

- on the use of our cacao to mix with magic mushroom she is using for therapy 

- ⁠she has reached out to her shaman contacts here on our ceremonial grade cacao

PS: she is a state certified therapist for magic mushrooms also she is right now helping setup the Portland branch for the church of the Sacred growth which is based out of Oakland ‎<This message was edited>
[5/13/24, 4:14:04 PM] Gary Teh: @17755088150 has helped sold off two bags of ceremonial grade Cacao to shamans here in Portland. I will pop by and drop them off to her and then pass through again.

[5/13/24, 8:39:25 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the bus kings will be touring Oregon this summer and autumn 

Daniel spent bulk of the evening explaining how the eeed growing business he used to run works as well as the local market dynamics for psilocybin mushrooms in Oregon 

https://youtu.be/OB-wxZdlJxU?si=blGq6atWeT4ZnmwH

Even thought weed is officially legalized, weed from the legal channels are of poorer quality and more expensive. Legal distributors need to pay government their taxes and end up needing to cut back on quality 

Meanwhile weed off the black market is of way higher quality but at 50% the price since no taxes were paid to the government and more money could be deployed to generate higher quality output 

_PS: Black Market price for psilocybin mushroom in Portland Oregon is USD2.50 per gram compared to USD10 per gram out there in the Arizona desert 🤯_
[5/14/24, 1:41:17 PM] Gary Teh: In case you’re wondering how crazy the journey into the rainforest visit to Cacao farms are, this is one of those crazy ones

I fell off the motorbike on this one when we were going down a steep slope coming out the farm

[5/22/24, 5:49:18 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: we are only scanned if we are speeding, so lucky to have a scan at all. I think this scan doesn’t say he has not been driving or moving after
[5/22/24, 5:50:11 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: only if he is sharing this data with you. find a friend or so
[5/22/24, 5:51:31 AM] Janet: Contact Sarah

[5/22/24, 10:17:28 AM] Garis Pang: I am guessing maybe his car broken down in the middle of nowhere and it’s hard to seek help from where he was.
[5/22/24, 10:18:16 AM] Bhavana: I'm not in the USA currently
[5/22/24, 10:18:24 AM] Val Lapidus: @17755088150 can you check with this person you are talking to about what would happen if someone’s car broke down near there?  is there a way to get service?

19 May?
[5/22/24, 10:26:55 AM] Sarah H.: Yes
[5/22/24, 10:28:55 AM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Sarah. 

I was going to fly down next week to Tacoma to trace where Gary is last spotted, so this is helpful 

Just that we cannot be sure if the person she (Marcia) met is Indeed Gary
[5/22/24, 10:29:15 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: I guess now is a good time to contact the festival organizers
[5/22/24, 10:29:36 AM] Sarah H.: @Aga sent the arganizers an email
[5/22/24, 10:29:45 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: Awesome ❤️

[5/22/24, 10:32:43 AM] Sarah H.: Fine
[5/22/24, 10:33:00 AM] Sarah H.: He is at the clean up crew
[5/22/24, 10:34:05 AM] Val Lapidus: how do we know he is with cleanup crew?
[5/22/24, 10:34:18 AM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Sarah, so Gary is still at the Festival now? Since 19 May (Sunday?)
[5/22/24, 10:34:32 AM] Sarah H.: That’s what the Facebook group is saying
‎[5/22/24, 10:34:56 AM] Sarah H.: ‎image omitted
[5/22/24, 10:37:03 AM] Johnson Teh: Ok thanks Sarah,

So Gary is cleaning up with the clean up crew at the festival site now? And site has no signal?
[5/22/24, 10:38:36 AM] Sarah H.: That’s what members of the Facebook group are saying
[5/22/24, 10:38:38 AM] Garis Pang: Strange? If they can exchange texts on FB and Gary’s mobile got no Wifi to be connected? ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 10:38:59 AM] Sarah H.: They are all back from the event - I posted pics of the comments
[5/22/24, 10:39:18 AM] Johnson Teh: Whoever is in touch with the organiser please ask them for update on the event and keep us posted 

Rest will wait for more update

[5/22/24, 10:46:13 AM] Yousra: Oh just saw the above 🙏🏼
[5/22/24, 10:47:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: As long as he is not writing here and police still has him on the list of missing people, we shall continue with the search, I believe. What do you think?
[5/22/24, 10:55:47 AM] Garis Pang: I guess you are right, I am thinking alike too.
[5/22/24, 10:57:13 AM] Barbara Sandini: Okay so is this true? He is alive and well?
[5/22/24, 10:58:10 AM] Garis Pang: Firstly, who is the TS of this Reddit post?
[5/22/24, 10:58:35 AM] Iwona Fluda: I mean you can basically see anything these days on the internet - a place full of made up stories. ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 11:02:33 AM] Garis Pang: If Gary can’t be contacted either ways since he left the fair after the cleaning up, means he is officially a missing person, which is more than a week by now. What do you think?
[5/22/24, 11:03:11 AM] Iwona Fluda: Totally, this is why we shall keep on searching.
[5/22/24, 11:03:59 AM] Val Lapidus: I think based on feedback from people at the festival where he was, he was part of the cleanup crew who was meant to leave to day
[5/22/24, 11:04:06 AM] Val Lapidus: so I’m pausing searching
[5/22/24, 11:04:44 AM] Garis Pang: In fact, we are all worrying and working in each own limited ways to search for him to come in contact again.
[5/22/24, 11:09:58 AM] Garis Pang: Can you confirm this that he is very ok?
[5/22/24, 11:22:22 AM] Janet: Wen was the festival dates. Is it still ongoing and how long does clean up crew takes. Best bet to contact cleaning crew management
[5/22/24, 11:22:54 AM] Janet: Today
[5/22/24, 11:25:59 AM] Tiff Tiff: GREAT WORK SARAH!!!! ✨✨✨✨✨❤️

[5/22/24, 11:37:55 AM] Johnson Teh: Hi, for all these whom have access to the festival organiser and attendee via FB
 
just to be sure….

(1) festival site has no network 
(2) It ended on 20 May (Sun) and 
(3) Gary has stayed behind with the clean up crew to help with the cleaning up…

So Gary might pop up anytime once he has network?? 

If so lets pray and keep all posted.
Thanks

[5/22/24, 1:40:14 PM] Gary Teh: Oh..  sorry

I didn’t realize they had totally zero Internet there until I finally parked and started helping setup the fair as a volunteer 🤦‍♂️

But seems like I have been invited to a whole bunch of other festivals like these in the pacific north west for the rest of the season 

Great place to promote our cacao 

People loved it for the following reasons 

- the taste from the way the medicine of the heart was prepared was spectacular 

- ⁠the story of being able to perform a simple act to help restore our rainforest was absolutely empowering to these folks most of whom have never stepped outside of the country before 

- ⁠the price point was a no brainer 

We have a winning product. We just need to monitor customer retention to see if this acquisition method via festivals can scale 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 1:41:01 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : yay, AI Cacao Gary showed up. Glad you’re okay
[5/22/24, 1:43:20 PM] Johnson Teh: Px point didn't priced in your missing and the energy it took us to locate

But pretty amazing to know how resourceful this CG can be.

Thanks all for their great effort
[5/22/24, 1:43:22 PM] Janet: Retention … and I thought South Americans were involved. Or who knows who …
[5/22/24, 1:52:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: guys guys what was Mister @14153000019 calling this type of incident “ the switch” or something like that totally believing that without him the community would never engage?

then I guess…I can proudly say… in your face @14153000019 … even without you we were able to engage on a most efficient level that we were able to retrieve you before even you got the time to get back online and reply here ;)
[5/22/24, 1:57:29 PM] Iwona Fluda: How exciting! 😂🙃 Please just give someone a list of the places before disappearing again. At some point, even FBI will give up on you 😜
[5/22/24, 1:58:15 PM] Iwona Fluda: The Poles, they are always dangerous 😂
[5/22/24, 2:38:22 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: If we say in Swiss German someone is im Cacao, it means at the end of the world or even in a mess. Well glad, you’re back 😜
[5/22/24, 3:27:33 PM] Gary Teh: The folks at the fair started at emulating the sound of crows after listening to the name *_cacao*_ being mentioned a few times

I think that’s has somewhat became the tagline 🤔
[5/22/24, 3:32:33 PM] Tiff Tiff: @14153000019 - I hope you are feeling great knowing that you are loved, you are noticed and witnessed and that if you are in trouble people all over the globe will be coming to find you ❤️

[5/22/24, 10:59:41 PM] Gary Teh: I was invited to come back for the okanogan barter faire in fall during the last week of October 

There is usually 4X more people in that one versus the one in spring which was what I just attended. 

My assumption is that the bales of hay will end up 4X higher in fall… 

Go figure 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

The local honey mead (_wine_) producer came up and requested for my contact details

He is seeking chocolate to lace his honey mead with 

There doesn’t seem to be any local chocolatier

The closest chocolatier he can visit is in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon 

As a source he feels it’s very important to be able to taste test it before placing an order of shipment

PS: _*the consumer customer sales activity organically yielding enterprise customer pattern*_ that was exhibited in my parents’ food distribution business back in Singapore is starting to manifest in this project too. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/27/24, 11:32:55 PM] Gary Teh: As adviced by Peter Thiel (_paypal cofounder_), gain a large share of a small market and then scaling strategically.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7ewO1IyZun/?igsh=MXNjdWNqM2sxaHM4ag== 

Competition has been non-existent and if they did exist, our offering is sufficiently differentiated at these small scale regional barter faires up here in the Pacific Northwest. 

From my perspective, it is strategic to fully saturate this distribution and establish a firm foothold before we start expanding to the next distribution channels.

Part of this process will be identifying and recruiting the lieutenants to secure and continue operating these areas before I shift my attention to the next adjacent distribution channel

This is where having an Multilevel marketing model in place comes in handy ‎<This message was edited>

[5/28/24, 1:39:24 PM] Gary Teh: There seems to be a tribune of elders amongst the nomad community that regularly communicate amongst themselves where they collectively maintain a black list of people that should be kept out of the network. 

The reverse seem to be also the case where elders in the community will take notice of an outsider when an elder vouches for him or her. These unnamed elders will at their own time and pace come interact with the outsider and come to their own judgement.

As more and more elders in the network vouch for this outsider, he/she gains status/reputation within the network. The by-product is invitation to access network facilities that are not usually accessible to outsiders.
[5/28/24, 1:43:35 PM] Gary Teh: During my recent visit back to the zen monastery north of the Golden Gate Bridge, Scot seem to hint at something similar too

[5/31/24, 6:23:08 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the best way to rapidly gain reputation and support within the nomadic network in the Pacific Northwest is to bring a ton of food to each campfire I visit and then cook and serve it

our hunter gathering forefathers had to hunt to acquire food while our modern day humans have to work a 9-5 to acquire food. 

The most efficient hack I have discovered so far is to go hunter gathering at local food banks for weeks worth of supplies and then unloaded them at every camp I visit. 

This is my most recent hunter gathering hack if anyone is curious🤩🙏

[6/1/24, 12:00:30 AM] Gary Teh: These past few weeks while sitting around doing nothing offline, I have been mulling this one question.

The question was posed to me by a fellow hacker at the HackerDojo down in Mountain View, Silicon Valley last year. while me and @16468233438 were serving out samples of our cacao drink

*_How do you measure biodiversity in an ecosystem and ensure that the cabruca system actually helps with biodiversity?*_

A few months ago I did manage to find a lot of mathematical formulas to measure biodiversity in an ecosystem. The most common one is the *_Shannon diversity index*_.

https://www.statology.org/shannon-diversity-index/ 

The math is easy, the main challenge lies in gathering the data and compiling the biodiversity index of a farm. 

Farmers are busy. And it’s comes across as additional work for what would be considered marketing purposes from their perspective

Working through the statistics and thinking through the available technology that is out there, seems the least effortful way to implement the measurement of this would be to use a drone mounted with a high resolution camera 

The video from the drone would be piped to an AI model that then identifies and quantifies all the different species of plants and animals surfaced in the video stream

And if we flew the drone in a fixed pattern across the farm from _east to west, north to south_ we should end up with a 80% accurate count of the different species in the environment 

If this same methodology is applied on all the farms we survey, we will end up with a good enough tabulation overtime. 

We can then justify why we decided to support one farm and not another farm.

And each farm in our support network will come associated with a Shannon index 

And people who buy our bags of cacao nibs could then scan the associated QR code and very quickly see the statistics of the farm the cacao is from. 

If we want ensure the records against being tempered, we could write the records on the blockchain signed with our key

That is how I would see AI and blockchain being implemented at the farm level ‎<This message was edited>

They seem keen to import Coconut water

Might spend sometime to source for it when in Brazil 

Noticed that Whole Foods in Rochester  New York is now selling each for $4.99

_PS: Heather mentioned she would be open sourcing for investors on her side to finance the importing of the coconut water once I figured out the sourcing_

_will be joining their crew for the Guignol horror film festival in September again later this year_

_Julia who organizes the Guignol horror film festival in Portland Oregon with Dylan did mentioned that if I ever publish a documentary, she and Dylan would be very happy to screen it when they go on their Hollywood indie film circuit._

_Will capture footage on the state of the rainforest in Brazil during my upcoming visit to compile one such documentary for @120363044028036610@g.us and tap on their network_ ‎<This message was edited>
