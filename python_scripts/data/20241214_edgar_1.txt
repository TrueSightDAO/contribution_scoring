[11/17/24, 3:33:35 PM] Gary Teh: Rededicating this chatroom to discuss about sell off reports surfaced by Edgar
[11/17/24, 3:58:00 PM] Gary Teh: We now have 7 years worth of market, news and macro economic data in the database 

It makes sense to retrain Edgar’s model while incorporating Grok

Likely new parameters will have surfaced during this period

Also starting to get a hang of utilizing Edgar for swing trading purposes 

And it is not for high frequency or short term trading 

Since that is purely in the done of full fledged AI models ‎<This message was edited>
[11/18/24, 6:26:44 AM] Gary Teh: I notice sell offs when they happen tend to be thematic.
[11/18/24, 6:27:17 AM] Gary Teh: Right now alot of the sell offs happening are to do with Chinese stocks as well as semicondutors
[11/18/24, 12:22:40 PM] Jake Nelan: This is awesome
[11/18/24, 1:54:29 PM] Gary Teh: Now that our TDG tokens has gained liquidity exchange rate to USDT and Federal reserve interest rates allow falling again, It makes sense leverage on this for Edgar’s  prediction markets

Technically, we don’t want betters to have to pay to provide signals as those are available to us for training data purposes 

But we also do not want them to keep on dumping shit signals in the system because that doesn’t help with building our training data 

I Propose the following rules 

Each week betters are allowed up to three bets on 3 stock symbol

By indicating whether bullish or bearish on a specific stock symbol 

He is not allowed to indicate both bullish or bearish on a stock symbol 

At the end of the week, the results are tabulated and for each correct signal he is awarded 10 TDG. 

He can then exchange the TDG for USDT

You also want them to be able to exchange their TDG for insights generated by Edgar ‎<This message was edited>
