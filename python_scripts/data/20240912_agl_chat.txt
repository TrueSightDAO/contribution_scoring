[7/25/23, 10:10:36 PM] Gary Teh: Haven’t heard from them. Perhaps our volume is too low for them to be keen
[7/26/23, 12:46:27 PM] Gary Teh: If no more feedback, I will start using the script to recruit for focus group participants in our offline session on the 20th of august
[7/26/23, 12:53:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Iwona  and I have figured out an online collab . I think we can share something by next weekend

[7/26/23, 1:00:27 PM] Gary Teh: We will execute on this once we get the quotations from our supplier for the preparation and shipping of the 100kg cacao nibs
[7/26/23, 1:02:59 PM] Gary Teh: The USD3000 will only allow us to work with a single supplier

So from my perspective, once we get the quotations in from both Brazil and Ecuador we will know which supplier we will have Ken work with for his engagement

[7/26/23, 3:59:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Are we going to mark on each bag which country the nibs came from?

[7/26/23, 4:01:50 PM] Gary Teh: See lower right hand corner of the package design

As discussed and agreed upon with Tres, country will have its own GS1 barcode 

That way if one country has issues the rest are not affected
[7/26/23, 4:10:12 PM] Val Lapidus: Does each country have different taste?
[7/26/23, 4:19:14 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. Very different 

You will be very surprised
[7/26/23, 4:19:26 PM] Gary Teh: You will get a sense once we meet
[7/26/23, 4:25:54 PM] Val Lapidus: I think that whatever the profile of the flavor is for each country we should lift that on the bag so that consumers know what they are getting
[7/26/23, 4:27:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, my wife works in impact investing.  Something that they're recently making a change to is instead of having a farmer bee sustainable, they should be a regenerative farmer which means it's better for the environment and for their farmland.  Perhaps we should market ourselves as working with regenerative farmers rather than
[7/26/23, 4:28:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Sustainable farming.
[7/26/23, 4:59:08 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 🙂👍

That way we can go through it again later and start pulling out all the insights into a document 🙂👍
[7/27/23, 4:51:48 PM] Iwona Fluda: The insights will be documented during the session, so no recording needed. Per principle to ensure trust and deep collaboration, I don’t record the session. 
P.S. just realized that I was too optimistic to run it next week, might move the date.

[7/28/23, 3:50:41 AM] Gary Teh: Just a random crazy idea, I wonder if it might actually be cheaper to just simply buy a cheap car and park it by the LAX parking lot for USD155 per month for storage purposes. 🤣
[7/28/23, 4:00:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: If that’s legal OK and the microclimate of the car won’t impact the quality of the product - why not?

[7/28/23, 12:30:14 PM] Tess walkowski: Detroit.  Rent a warehouse in my building.

[7/28/23, 12:34:19 PM] Tess walkowski: What do you think of doing a cook with nips event or ceremonial nibs
[7/28/23, 12:34:57 PM] Tess walkowski: I want to do a white chocolate with raspberry and could use nibs for that but need the cacao butter too and vanilla lol
[7/28/23, 12:35:08 PM] Tess walkowski: Or things for at home keto
[7/28/23, 1:37:19 PM] Gary Teh: something like this might us serve well

Tear out the four backseats and we are done. 

All 90kg can be stored in the space that are freed up. 

We can park it by ocean beach SF. The weather is generally chilly here anyways.

[7/28/23, 2:24:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Sorry Gary, this is a bad idea. It will get broken into and everything inside of it will be stalled
[7/28/23, 2:24:32 PM] Val Lapidus: Stolen
[7/28/23, 2:26:12 PM] Val Lapidus: Or most likely the car itself will get stolen
‎[7/28/23, 3:00:56 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/28/23, 3:04:35 PM] Gary Teh: We can keep boxes at your place for fulfillment purposes as and when orders come in from Amazon

The rest of the 18 boxes we can keep them in the storage unit for USD17 a month
[7/28/23, 3:05:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Honestly I'll charge you $15 a month and it doesn't have to be USD. It can be tokens
[7/28/23, 3:05:46 PM] Val Lapidus: Or if you feel like that's too much, you name me a proce
[7/28/23, 3:08:11 PM] Gary Teh: In tokens would be wonderful. Deal!! 🤩
boomz! 👊🏻

Just to clarify is it for storing of the 2 boxes and handling the fulfillment from Amazon as and when they come in?
[7/28/23, 3:08:40 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/28/23, 3:09:07 PM] Gary Teh: Or is it storing of all 20 boxes at your place and then handling fulfillment from Amazon as and when they come in?

[7/28/23, 3:39:55 PM] Tess walkowski: I was scouting for a Ford transit

[7/29/23, 7:51:16 PM] Val Lapidus: I have a Prius v which has a little bit of extra carrying capacity. It's deceptively large
[7/29/23, 7:51:24 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. That should work. I don’t think the airport authorities would be very happy for us to go in and out multiple times
[7/29/23, 7:51:38 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! 🤩
[7/29/23, 7:52:37 PM] Val Lapidus: When does it arrive?
[7/29/23, 7:53:33 PM] Val Lapidus: I think I can fit all 20
[7/29/23, 7:56:27 PM] Gary Teh: Still a few more steps before we get there 

   Step 1 - finalize quotation from supplier which includes packaging 

    Step 2 - sign agreement with them to go ahead and assemble the packaging 

   Step 3 - sign agreement with and pay FSVP agent USD3000

    Step 4 - get our FSVP agent to get talk to their QC department to get the paperwork we need from them

    Step 5 - finally ship it over to SFO
[7/29/23, 7:58:27 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! It shouldn’t take up more than 15 cubic foot of space

[7/30/23, 4:42:17 AM] Anupa/diya: Hey I was thinking of doing mine on the 20th August since you had said early August. Should we just do it so close  or spread it out . I can do mine in September sometime
[7/30/23, 4:58:20 AM] Iwona Fluda: We can decide depending on the number of registrations & channels we are promoting this event on. If also on Meetup, yes - it makes sense to have both further apart.
[7/30/23, 4:58:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: As mentioned somewheer above, I might move the event as I was too optimistic to run in just in a week .

[7/30/23, 3:29:02 PM] Gary Teh: It's what we can approach vendors with
[7/30/23, 3:29:02 PM] Gary Teh: A 3-4 page visual summary of us to potential clients
[7/30/23, 4:21:09 PM] Gary Teh: I think it’s also important to figure out how will the partners that you have in mind would benefit from supporting us since they already have their core business and would probably not want to get distract from that.

Once we are done with our focus group, I suggest that we arrange a Zoom session where we meet up to share the insights we have gathered. Thereafter we do a poll to figure out which components in each stage of the AAARR to prioritize since there are literally a whole bunch of options available at each stage.
[7/30/23, 8:00:46 PM] Gary Teh: As @5511982667030 has suggested the other DAO members do not have enough of in-depth context on our project, so prioritization of options voting will be done within this guild

As and when we need help and support we could reach out to the larger DAO via the townhall or the beer hall

That way we could  reduced noise in our collaboration efforts, be more focused in our execution, be more selective in when we tap into the larger DAO thereby also reducing noise levels in the main channels 🙂👍

[7/31/23, 2:12:39 PM] Gary Teh: For the few samples we are going to make either in my car or @16468233438 place

If the agricultural cooperatives we are getting our supplies from ends up failing to help us with the packaging and we have to assemble it ourselves and we figure there is demand for powder form too, we might end up assembling the cacao powder bags in a commercial kitchen here in SF

[8/1/23, 1:35:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Sure! I had a brief glance.. looks good. I think all of us are pretty much aligned with the same approach
[8/1/23, 1:36:38 AM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 @16468233438 if you guys could also photograph.  It's good for documentation
[8/1/23, 1:38:37 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 was suggesting once we are done with these three separate focus groups we regroup to start defining the customer personas in keto cacao nibs market segment
[8/1/23, 2:42:08 AM] Anupa/diya: For sure !
[8/1/23, 2:42:43 AM] Anupa/diya: I was going to suggest the same so the synthesis can feed into the main insights

[8/2/23, 12:14:22 PM] Tess walkowski: Same issues on stickers and labels
[8/2/23, 12:16:54 PM] Iwona Fluda: Does the packaging need to be sustainable?
[8/2/23, 12:18:21 PM] Anupa/diya: You should ask them what is the issue. The only issue I see couldn't be the dpi High print or they needed an open file. I feel you can just go to neighborhood printer
[8/2/23, 12:20:33 PM] Gary Teh: What is the context behind this question?
[8/2/23, 12:22:56 PM] Iwona Fluda: Positioning, etc. I run a social enterprise here in Switzerland, and my aim is to create a 360 degrees social enterprise. That means that all steps on the way need to be social and sustainable. This is also great for positioning, not just because part of my heart beats for it.
[8/2/23, 12:23:56 PM] Iwona Fluda: With the assumption that keto nerds might be also socially and environmentally aware, this could be a great differenciator
[8/2/23, 12:24:23 PM] Gary Teh: We will hopefully gain some insights on this during the focus groups
[8/2/23, 12:24:52 PM] Iwona Fluda: P.S. as a nerd myself, I would go for it :P
[8/2/23, 12:25:05 PM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is a medicine of the heart, so it makes sense, and the tree grows best like the heart wild and free
[8/2/23, 12:25:36 PM] Tess walkowski: I was thinking about cacao ceremonies for nerds as a fellow nerd
[8/2/23, 12:26:17 PM] Iwona Fluda: Im in! Also: just stopped drinking coffee a few weeks ago and move to cacao and matcha.
[8/2/23, 12:27:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Matcha would also be great to source and import and it's a great comparison
[8/2/23, 12:27:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Preparing matcha is a ritual

[8/3/23, 3:22:45 PM] Gary Teh: While we await for participants, I was thinking through the following aspects of the go to market for our keto cacao nibs 

*The channel*
Which social media platforms to utilize Instagram, YouTube, TikTok…

*The method*
Paying for ads or getting influencers to do the promotion  

*The format*
Text, videos or photos as the primary format 

Once we figure out what the Unique value proposition (UVP) is, we will need to package the UVP and deliver it on the right channel, using the right method and the right format 

*paramters*
The parameters to consider are

    - cost: how much does it cost to. More competition more costly. More channels more costly.
 
    - reach: how many people naturally hang out at the channel 

    - uniqueness: how much can our messaging stand out. More competition using the same format less unique
[8/3/23, 3:23:40 PM] Gary Teh: Would be great to get some new ideas on 

    - channel
    - method 
    - format

Once we figure out one that works, I propose we should just double down on it till we hit channel saturation

[8/3/23, 9:07:15 PM] Gary Teh: This is for 100kg shipment size

Prize increases to USD20,000 when if shipment size increases to 1,000KG
[8/3/23, 10:02:56 PM] Gary Teh: I believe the package size needs to be just right that the entire package runs out after 30 days of consumption 

That way, customers will be compelled to want to buy another package from us to participate in the same game again next month and win. 

Every month is a new round

Honestly I am struggling on my side at the moment trying to recruit focus group participants. 

Somewhat throwing in the towel on my side at this point in that department. If anyone wants to pick up the slack please feel free. 🙏
[8/4/23, 6:31:39 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished reading through this 24 page FSVP regulation document regarding small importers like us

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20220329_anika_the_non_fungible_gauntlet.pdf

These were left by Anika who was active in our DAO last year when she was fanatical about NFTs. She has since became inactive, I believe she lost a whole bunch of life savings from her parents investing them in NFTs.

Nevertheless the education materials she acquired are still useful for the NFT campaign that you are working on

[8/8/23, 2:33:03 AM] Anupa/diya: Well in that case your user base will want to look inti at the value of the token rather than the product itself. Our target group will be very different and we wil need a very robust plan for token circulation and also marketing.
[8/8/23, 2:33:27 AM] Anupa/diya: We could definitely look at time stamping
[8/8/23, 2:33:51 AM] Anupa/diya: How many packages can be made
[8/8/23, 2:34:12 AM] Gary Teh: first shipment 500 packages of 8 ounce
[8/8/23, 2:34:28 AM] Gary Teh: what was your original thought?
[8/8/23, 2:38:32 AM] Anupa/diya: I was thinking that if we sell this batch through Amazon and other methods we can start the initial run for product circulation and awareness building. We are not selling it as trade and utility tool. The dynamics of that is very different.
[8/8/23, 2:40:32 AM] Anupa/diya: We should look at time stamping where we have the packet on the blockavhain for Traceability and transperancy. I think that's more valuable at this point
[8/8/23, 2:42:01 AM] Anupa/diya: We can do a nft pilot project. After a few sales. There are so many scams no one wants to invest without some proof
[8/8/23, 2:43:31 AM] Anupa/diya: If we are adding the products on the shelves I think that's great visibility
[8/8/23, 2:44:40 AM] Anupa/diya: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsbtc.com/nft/blue-chip-nft-101-down-down-to-goblintown-an-unlikely-success-story/amp/

[8/9/23, 3:12:23 AM] Anupa/diya: Time stamping can also include the shipping

[8/10/23, 2:46:06 PM] Gary Teh: If we plan to utilize FoodLens for traceability, FoodLens will charge us 3% of our retail price to generate QR codes linking back to their site which showcases the entire supply chain 

Makes sense to incorporate this if traceability so important that it drives consumer purchasing behavior 

If not, I am not sure why we are introducing this cost component that will eat into our profit margins
[8/10/23, 2:46:37 PM] Gary Teh: Could you further expand on this
[8/10/23, 2:50:47 PM] Gary Teh: *Key personal focus for today*

    - assemble actual package based on Brazil cooperative dimension

    - chat with @16468233438 about how to approach Dean on burning man 

    - figure out if we will use Shopify or a simple Wordpress shopping cart website for Agroverse consumer facing website 

    - reach out to one more financing professional (within John Tan’s network) to get a second opinion on the financing structure for the incoming shipments

[8/10/23, 2:59:19 PM] Anupa/diya: During one of the initial conversations, when we said we would have the option of buying via the website. We said we would initially direct the consumers to Amazon and not go through the logistics
[8/10/23, 3:00:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Should we put it on hold then
[8/10/23, 3:00:58 PM] Gary Teh: Amazon charged USD4 for the logistics 

Essentially that would kill off our profit margins
[8/10/23, 3:01:23 PM] Anupa/diya: Can we manage self shipment
[8/10/23, 3:01:47 PM] Gary Teh: If you are already in the middle of it, complete what you have done and present it to our guild 

We can then file it away on our ledger and revisit it once we are ready

[8/10/23, 3:03:19 PM] Anupa/diya: Even If we do it. It will be take us a while to release it. We need to build the community atleast for the next 6 months. If we do the nft project with right scope it should take us a few months
[8/10/23, 3:03:44 PM] Gary Teh: Diana is a fund manager in the ESG space and Web3 space
[8/10/23, 3:04:21 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense to continue executing it then if the lag time is so long
[8/10/23, 3:04:59 PM] Anupa/diya: Just adding it on opensea won't be advisable
[8/10/23, 3:14:06 PM] Iwona Fluda: We can help here with the NFTs - launching a new platform soon and happy to have you as early adopters 🌟
[8/10/23, 3:14:45 PM] Iwona Fluda: Totally agreed, did some extra deep analysis of different platforms and this one is a no go.
[8/10/23, 3:19:21 PM] Anupa/diya: It will still be Early. I think the new platform releases soon right ?
[8/10/23, 3:19:38 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. I trust both of you can oversee this aspects of Agroverse. I am hands off on this 🙂🙏

Logistics and go to market is a hand full right now
[8/10/23, 3:21:44 PM] Anupa/diya: Ya there are better ones but this is the most popular . However I feel we need to focus on teh strategy first and more so building the cacao nibs community
[8/10/23, 3:21:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Are we using social media marketing M
[8/10/23, 3:24:27 PM] Iwona Fluda: Yes, but we will be definitely for more than a longer while on the market. 😂

He mentions it would be hard if we don’t know what is the actual material the printer will be printing on 

Would there be a way to ask Orlantildes to get a sample material from the printer and have it shipped over?

[8/11/23, 4:59:56 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 What is the purpose and context for this request?

There is alot already going on on Orlantildes Bahia, Brazil side. Fatima has spoken with me to propose we have a clear strategy regarding how we interface with Brazil otherwise it will appear very haphazard from their perspective and it will not reflect well on us.
[8/11/23, 5:00:51 PM] Val Lapidus: I was thinking about burning Man and trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile to give an extra amount of supply to our contact there. If they agree
[8/11/23, 5:01:39 PM] Val Lapidus: I feel that burning man has a large population of people who are specifically going to be consumers of this type of product and it might be worthwhile to give out more samples to them

https://www.fda.gov/media/110327/download

I believe we (TrueTech Inc) will need to maintain our own set of records of our auditing of our foreign suppliers 

If it is indeed true, then there might in fact be a use case for utilizing blockchain establish our track records of auditing our foreign suppliers to meet the FSVP program

    - @918017107841 who had been lobbying for the use of blockchain in our traceability might feel excited because we might now have a very valid use case

    - @16468233438 who mentioned he is keen to build out a tech stack specifically geared towards companies might find this uses case  for FSVP compliance record keeping interesting

[8/11/23, 6:51:17 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, you may want to mention that the nibs are edible as is.  You can pair them with fruit. It is a superfood.  Alternatively, you can grind them down like a coffee.  However, if you wanted to do your own chocolate processing, you can get a tumbler specifically made for processing cacao beads into raw chocolate
[8/11/23, 6:54:22 PM] Gary Teh: I will just invite him over to your place or both of us head over then we can chat 

He is pretty Boomz

[8/12/23, 11:16:16 PM] Gary Teh: I can do 8am tomorrow morning
[8/12/23, 11:17:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Also Gary with regards to a potential supplier of Peruvian nibs.  Would it be cost effective for us to do that?  Isn't the point that we are buying directly from the producer Farmer in Brazil or wherever and that is why we are getting a reduction in cost. Wouldn't the Peruvian supplier that has the product already in the US in his price include the cost of getting the product here. So what would be the point of buying from them unless we are handling the export? What are we adding to this? That makes it worthwhile?

[8/12/23, 11:24:26 PM] Gary Teh: You are correct 

It totally negates the story we are telling if we got the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

My original random stupid idea was that if people in the keto community doesn’t really care where the supplies come from then why not just get the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

But a lot more facts has surfaced since that random stupid idea and now to make it obvious that was a random stupid idea.

It is like us buying some stuff from Walmart and then trying to sell you the stuff for a margin when you could just walk down the street yourself and then buy it yourself or just buy online. Totally zero value adding

[8/22/23, 9:25:28 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 please note

Me and @16468233438 have concluded our meeting. 

*The resolution*
    - source for commercial kitchen here in the Bay area to package our initial 100KG of cacao nibs
    - source for vendor to print stickers which we will use to stick on the 500 kraft pouches we will buy on Amazon

*Updated agenda when myself and @5511982667030 convenes*
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will package our cacao nibs using kraft pouch
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will handle the packaging for the initial 100KG
    - to determine which of the following we will convey to Orlantildes post 100KG pilot test:
        - Option 1) we will not be packaging our cacao nibs in Bahia ever again
        - Option 2) we will consider packaging in Bahia after the initial pilot test if a kraft pouch supplier that is economic can be sourced
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes to drop all current arrangements we have already in place with Mailan and Package printing company
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes we will pass him a sample of the taste profile we are going for based on the outcome of our focus group. He will need to source for USDA NOP organic certified cacao nibs and ensure they match the taste profile we indicated
[8/22/23, 10:49:04 PM] Val Lapidus: Speaking to my friend about our project.  Within our copy for the website we should have a comparison of how much a farmer usually makes when they sell cacao nibs to a distributor versus what a farmer will make when they sell to us.
‎[8/22/23, 10:50:18 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[8/22/23, 10:50:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, we should approach the company imperfect foods
[8/22/23, 10:51:39 PM] Val Lapidus: We should also donate a portion of our proceeds to carbon offsets
[8/22/23, 10:51:58 PM] Val Lapidus: Imperfect foods might be a good source of distribution for us
‎[8/22/23, 10:53:23 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[8/22/23, 11:19:18 PM] Gary Teh: Since the farmers plant trees

Why not directly issue carbon credits when every cacao tree sapling that gets planted??
[8/23/23, 12:27:47 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 please invite my friend Liz, she is the one that had those ideas above and should get credit for them.  Also she said she would like to help with the project
‎[8/23/23, 12:28:55 AM] Val Lapidus: ‎Contact card omitted
[8/23/23, 12:33:43 AM] Gary Teh: I am adding Liz to our beer hall for now 

Once we have a clear idea of the role she can play we can invite her into the guild

At which point, we will remove one member from the guild 🙂🙏

We should not use it in media in current state

[8/23/23, 12:34:05 PM] Val Lapidus: do cacao nibs release co2 that need to be vented within the pouch?
‎[8/23/23, 12:35:04 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/23/23, 12:36:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Conversely, chocolate needs to be totally protected against frost, heat, damage and loss of flavours. Chocolate bars are usually wrapped with a layer of aluminium foil or coated paper to preserve flavour, and covered by a sturdier outer layer typically made from cardboard or paper.

[8/23/23, 12:44:22 PM] Val Lapidus: both roastar and vistaprint are recommendations from kevin, please give him tokens for his contribution
[8/23/23, 12:47:26 PM] Val Lapidus: we have two great vendors for packaging, one at 1.95 per bag, which is a kraft compostable laminate (this was the type of bag that was most popular in our focus group, it evoked a sense of health),  and one which is 1.35/unit the material being multilayer aluminum foil (we have not tested this within the market)
[8/23/23, 12:48:06 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 and @16468233438 can we push back our 9am meeting for another 30minutes?

I need to head to the post office first to check out the dimension of the envelopes 

Created a stamps.com account yesterday that will give us cheaper shipping price but they need to know envelope dimensions before shipping labels could be printing
[8/23/23, 12:48:24 PM] Val Lapidus: yes, but i have a hard stop at 10a.m.
[8/23/23, 12:48:51 PM] Gary Teh: Or the both of you could start first?

Image 2: revenue distribution via Agroverse
[8/24/23, 1:12:18 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 pertaining the fundraising idea you have.

Would you be open to creating a deck? 

*purpose of the deck*
    - use it for fundraising 
    - use part of it as sales deck which we will need when reaching out to larger distributors
[8/24/23, 1:13:13 PM] Gary Teh: Had a chat with Victor last night. Understood that for initial pilot test with Whole Foods, they would want to have 500units ready for sale as testing
[8/24/23, 1:13:55 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes totally .
[8/24/23, 1:14:35 PM] Anupa/diya: We need a pair of eyes for the finance and tech
[8/24/23, 1:15:33 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 what goes into a pilot test with Whole Foods?  is there like a sampling station where they put someone out to have people try it, or is it just put on the shelf, and blamo, what's the per unit price that wholefoods pays us for the 500 units, or is it consignment based?
[8/24/23, 1:15:49 PM] Anupa/diya: I have looked a few ongoing grants which will be good to apply.
[8/24/23, 1:16:22 PM] Anupa/diya: Good point. Will agroverse become a listed vendor ?
[8/24/23, 1:21:52 PM] Gary Teh: Danielle Sunberg (business side) and her husband (finance side) would be good candidates for eyes

*Other finance eyes*

[8/24/23, 1:22:51 PM] Val Lapidus: do we have control of how samples are given?  like could we insist that it be sliced banana dunked in nibs?
‎[8/24/23, 1:23:02 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/24/23, 1:54:45 PM] Gary Teh: Someone in our DAO will be volunteering to hand out the samples if and when that happens. 🤣
[8/24/23, 2:19:47 PM] Gary Teh: @381642051030 regarding the go to market strategy document you will be crafting which we will walk through on 2nd of September could we have the following sections included

- Roles: their required weekly task described at a high level
    - Props: items we will need to have ready for these people to perform their roles
    - Schedule: exact step by step as to what task to perform for each role

That way, we have a good overview of what the level of undertaking is when we go about doing the execution. With that we will be able to:

    - adjust task load on each role
    - provide members with visibility we reach out to them for help

[8/25/23, 7:31:53 PM] Val Lapidus: For our pie chart, the numbers are as follows:
Farmer: 24%
Transportation: 25%
Packaging: 18%

Packaging: 32%
Transportation: 14%
Farmer: 6%

[8/27/23, 3:14:06 AM] Gary Teh: I have posed a request to @5511982667030 that for the upcoming meeting on Monday to inform Orlantildes of the following activities we are conducting on our end

*Items I am preparing*
- the list of critical points in the supply chain on Brazilian side identified during my previous visit 

- a preliminary list of hazards identified along each critical point of the cacao nibs preparation process based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested preventive controls based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested verifications measures to ensure integrity of preventive controls 

*What we need from him*
- a copy of the certificate of compliance that Coopercabruca has from the Brazilian government to allow for exports of cacao nibs overseas 

- preventive controls that Coopercabruca has in place to ensure they continue being in compliance with Brazilian government regulations to be eligible for exports of cacao nibs 

*expected outcomes of this exercise*

- combined and properly curated list of hazards identified to comply with existing Brazilian government regulations before exports are allowed and FDA FSVP compliance requirements 

- list of preventive measures that Coopercabruca has in place to prevent identified hazards 

- agreed upon verifications steps that Coopercabruca will undertake to ensure continued compliance so as to prevent identified potential hazards from occurring 

 *final outputs from this process* 

- a written assurance letter addressed to our company by the person in charge of quality control in Coopercabruca that agreed upon preventive controls are in place to prevent the list of potential hazards we have identified during this exercise 

- a mutually agreed upon recurring procedure we both agree to follow to verify that preventive controls are being diligently followed by Coopercabruca during the preparation and export of the cacao nibs

[8/27/23, 3:54:11 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 since you and me will be repackaging the cacao nibs in the kitchen facility we are renting, I will be drafting a set of the following documents 

*documents*
- hazard analysis
- preventive controls
- verification steps 

*outcome*
- When using the kitchen we will need to adhere to the preventative controls  that are documented 
- this is to cover our asses legally even though we are qualified for very small business exemptions 

*later on after successful mvp*
- get certified as a Preventive control qualified individual (15 hour structured curriculum) so that when our US based food facility gets audited by the FDA we got our asses covered because we have the necessary certification to claim preventive control qualified individual status 

- register the food facility we are planning to use on an ongoing basis

*regarding shared kitchen arrangement*

- The operator of the shared kitchen does not need to register the food facility with the FDA since that operator does not directly handle the food 

But post the MVP we will need to register whatever food facility we plan to use on an ongoing basis with the FDA and be compliant 

Check out this document if you are keen

[8/28/23, 12:52:12 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't remember any one in the focus group wanting the nibs to be smaller???  where did that feedback come from?
[8/28/23, 12:54:57 PM] Anupa/diya: I was creating the pie @16468233438 . Where would we add the budget for operations, tech, legal, customer support, marketing  and others. Would that be under the DAO
[8/28/23, 1:03:10 PM] Val Lapidus: the only categories that should exist are Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, and DAO, for us.
[8/28/23, 1:03:28 PM] Val Lapidus: we don't need to drill down any deeper into the breakdown then what i've described
[8/28/23, 1:04:56 PM] Anupa/diya: I would say we should factor in operational as it is important even in the preliminary stage
[8/28/23, 1:05:15 PM] Anupa/diya: Is this just for the website or are we going to be using this as a model
[8/28/23, 3:08:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Website
[8/28/23, 3:09:36 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm breaking it apart just like the world economic forum breaks it apart.  The world economic form does not list expenses like this.  So why would we, an infographic only makes sense if the items are expense are similar
[8/28/23, 3:54:03 PM] Gary Teh: You are correct. That is all under DAO
[8/28/23, 7:46:41 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 i've published the changes to: https://www.agroverse.shop/heart-healthy-cocoa-glazed-chinese-style-garlic-eggplant
[8/28/23, 10:24:12 PM] Anupa/diya: In that case we should have Marketing as a separate budget as a potential cost in the pie as stated.
[8/28/23, 10:26:39 PM] Val Lapidus: We don't have a marketing budget.  If we do in the future we can update this.  But the share will come out of the dao
[8/28/23, 10:27:59 PM] Val Lapidus: The way our structure works up to now is members tokenize their contribution towards a budget by exchanging dollar to tokens.  So if I was to spend $500 on marketing.  I would spend it out of my budget.  Then tokenize that money?  And thus the dao didn't spend anything on marketing other than tokens which is the equivalent of ownership shares.  We don't need to put anything for marketing now. In the future we can split up the dao share.  If we need to
[8/28/23, 10:39:19 PM] Anupa/diya: They are things been done on the marketing side which are getting tokenized now like the website and few other things. 

I think We should have a section called Marketing and Product design as a separate value and not added to the DAO.
[8/28/23, 10:43:28 PM] Val Lapidus: How do you quantify that as a percentage of the budget?  We don't have a true measurement of it and we don't have anything right now that points to how much that is actually costing us.  We leave it as part of the DAO right now.  Also, we want to make it look like we are not paying for marketing
[8/28/23, 10:44:51 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm all for radical transparency.  But what's the point of sticking our finger in the air and guessing?  The current numbers are the numbers that we can represent and show people that that is in fact what is happening
[8/28/23, 11:01:16 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's chat about this when we meet next so we can settle this
[8/28/23, 11:02:20 PM] Anupa/diya: As I said there are small number of marketing tokens which are been issued.
[8/28/23, 11:04:29 PM] Val Lapidus: If it's not easily convertible to Fiat, it's not measurable.  Tokens are not money.  They are shares of ownership?  This is not for the purpose of speaking to investors.  But for the purpose of marketing.
[8/28/23, 11:06:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I am aware of how it works. Web 3 marketing is a huge component and for investors  this will be area that they will look into
[8/28/23, 11:08:30 PM] Val Lapidus: So what is the concern that they don't see it broken down with a marketing budget. Shouldn't the DAO as a whole list it's marketing budget regardless of which product it's for? This breakdown is supposed to serve as proof that we are better than our competitors. With regards to how we split the profits with the farmer. The DAO itself on its website should list how much it spends on marketing.  But aggro verse doesn't do its own marketing
[8/28/23, 11:16:43 PM] Anupa/diya: Every project should function as an separate entity. That's the conversation we had in the initially. We can't group funding because it is not possible
[8/28/23, 11:17:35 PM] Val Lapidus: What percentage would you like to assign to marketing?
[8/28/23, 11:26:01 PM] Anupa/diya: We can set up a call and discuss
[8/28/23, 11:28:21 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 Just throw some random numbers in for now. 

I am sure we will start figuring out what it might be once we start executing the go to market strategy that @381642051030 is crafting 

My sense is if we are heading down the micro-influencer social marketing route as suggested by @381642051030 some of them will be very happy to receive governance tokens (1 TDG to 1USD) for their efforts creating videos and posting them to their followers 

As for others who are not, we will depriotize them until last resort (when DAO has fiat in our treasury). At that point we will know for sure how much fiat actually goes to marketing expenses

Also do note that it’s quite hard to amortize marketing expenses across the entire batch of all future bags of cacao nibs sold this is because of customer retention is strong (for example 100%), marketing budget associated with each bag sold will just end up tending towards zero as the same marketing dollar gets spread ever larger number of bags 

*Best case scenario*
Imagine a micro-influencer doing a one time video for governance tokens and it goes viral and then all target customers we will ever reach buys and retains 100%  

Marketing budget in this scenario is 0.

*worst case scenario*
DAO exhausted USD1 million on marketing. Zero bags sold. Everyone in the DAO went bankrupt. 

Then all the whole pie will just end up being marketing budget 🤣
[8/28/23, 11:29:44 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you have done your part by contributing the pie concept. Hands off for now

Let @918017107841 have her autonomy to do her stuff as she sees fit for website display
[8/28/23, 11:30:10 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s not waste time deliberating over what is the pie in the sky. 🙂🙏
[8/28/23, 11:32:15 PM] Val Lapidus: Agree put what number you want
[8/28/23, 11:32:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Marketing will be an integral part because we will have to factor in the roll out of the product. That has to come from funding. I can look into potential cacao nibs budgeting.  We should also look into someone who can be like CFO later on. We will need that 

It's better we look into all these things now in some what way because product pricing is key. 

I hope I can add more than random numbers 🤣🤣🤣
[8/28/23, 11:33:44 PM] Val Lapidus: If you are looking for me to give you a number I cannot.  Currently the number is zero.  Future it will be something.  I don't think we should base it off of other vendors but as I said put whatever number you want there ‎<This message was edited>
[8/28/23, 11:34:51 PM] Anupa/diya: We will have to look into some sort of product pricing..

[8/28/23, 11:51:40 PM] Val Lapidus: We had a meeting recently where we decided that the price will have to be $12 per 8 oz. Of cacao nibs.  That is what all these percentages are based off.  I specifically kept everything in percentages because we shouldn't attribute hard values to shares of the pie prices change and this is an abstract infographic
[8/28/23, 11:53:01 PM] Val Lapidus: Our current price is based entirely off of the price that our competitors are charging
[8/29/23, 12:46:57 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 see if your could use any of these existing footages

[8/29/23, 12:52:35 AM] Anupa/diya: We can just use the YouTube widget
[8/29/23, 12:52:44 AM] Gary Teh: You can auto translate the subtitles in YouTube
[8/29/23, 12:53:17 AM] Gary Teh: Or can get Matheus help to do so
[8/29/23, 12:53:44 AM] Anupa/diya: Some of them are not accurate but will try. Mathers can help.. this can be used for our marketing promos as well
[8/29/23, 1:22:42 PM] Val Lapidus: hi who is the graphic designer for our project
[8/29/23, 1:34:06 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 please reach out to @972543523823 

She is based in Amsterdam and is during the weekdays 

She will be happy to provide support during the weekends 

So have the request in as detail as possible sent over to her during the weekday 

Hopefully she could look into it on the weekend 

DM is generally more effective as she doesn’t really check the groups as much 🙂🙏
[8/29/23, 2:23:47 PM] Val Lapidus: I found a vendor that will do screen printing, 2 colors both sides in kraft compostable pouches.  the cost will be .15 per bag, 90$ for printing, and cost to ship to me
[8/29/23, 2:23:58 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm going to go with this vendor, rather than buy a printer
[8/29/23, 2:24:45 PM] Val Lapidus: I've asked our graphic designer via DM to give me a new image, with the required constraints
[8/30/23, 2:01:58 AM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to your support @972543523823 🙂🙏

Which would not only give us access to a space, but a captive audience that would sample the cacao nibs and give us feedback on the product.  He is going to get back to me later this week, if not early next

[9/3/23, 3:24:25 PM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with @5511982667030 about getting a farmers market stand in Sf so that we can conduct focus group every Sunday without even trying to recruit people since the foot traffic is naturally there
[9/3/23, 3:29:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Farmers market generally charge you for a stall
[9/3/23, 3:29:33 PM] Val Lapidus: The cost can be negligible but it adds up over time
[9/3/23, 3:29:45 PM] Val Lapidus: When we do a farmer's market we need to have all the marketing materials such as sign in information on how customers can get it
[9/3/23, 3:52:51 PM] Gary Teh: Might be the same things we need when we start doing the pop ups In sprouts, Whole Foods and Safeway

[9/4/23, 8:32:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Let me have a look
[9/4/23, 8:42:39 AM] Gary Teh: Here are my thoughts regarding go to market

*immediate*
    - Instagram official presence 

    - micro-influencers marketing (1000 to 10,000 followers)

*intermediate*
    - instagram shop: Wix allows integration into Instagram shop
    - Amazon shopfront 

*once we are sure of our supply chain*
    - Sprouts
    - Whole Foods 
    - Safeway
[9/4/23, 10:16:28 AM] Anupa/diya: @381642051030 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R5MWrJEonycTXHZ7lQMxkwq4qgJmM7xs Please have a look at the photos

[9/4/23, 10:19:13 AM] Anupa/diya: Are we doing shipping within the usa
[9/4/23, 10:19:18 AM] Anupa/diya: or other parts as well
[9/4/23, 10:22:08 AM] Gary Teh: Right now just within the USA 

Judging based on the shipping cost estimates from USA to other parts of the world, e.g. to @41796560010 Aga and Francois

The shipping cost is prohibitive 

If Switzerland does indeed have a lot of incoming request then it makes sense to setup an alternate supply chain that does not pass through USA but ships directly from Brazil

If such is the case then we will setup a packaging operation within Brazil
[9/4/23, 10:22:57 AM] Gary Teh: Shipping cost from Brazil to Switzerland is USd22.89
[9/4/23, 10:23:43 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/4/23, 10:24:05 AM] Anupa/diya: we need to add that to the website somewhere
[9/4/23, 10:24:14 AM] Gary Teh: I am almost tempted to print our packaging in the USA in large bulk using the vendor that @16468233438 sourced for and fly into Brazil myself and transfer the printed packages to our packer

[9/9/23, 4:54:06 AM] Val Lapidus: @972543523823 hey Annia, I didn't know that the two colors need to be separated and not mixed.  Looks like your design won't work.  But we will have this vendor print stickers and adhere those to the bag.  So we have full use of colors.  We can use your original design.  Just need to adjust it to a specific size
[9/9/23, 4:54:22 AM] Val Lapidus: Awaiting vendor to provide sizing

They paid someone else to do it just once 

But they are f**king broke

[9/17/23, 4:08:16 PM] Gary Teh: I think before we more seriously explore ESG community donations component for Agroverse let’s just make sure we can actually sell the cacao nibs in USA first 🤣

100% donation of USD0 is still 0USDjust wasting everybody calories talking about NULL scenario 🤯

[9/20/23, 8:52:57 AM] Anupa/diya: the Brazilian government has launched a program called “Internet para Todos” (Internet for All) that aims to bring internet access to remote areas by building cell towers and laying fiber optic cables. Another barrier to internet access in rural Brazil is the cost of internet service.
[9/20/23, 8:52:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Mexico’s Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) announced this week that it would budget over MX$622.8M toward its “Internet for all” campaign in order to improve connectivity in Mexico. This project makes up one pillar of the five infrastructure projects set out by the ministry for this yea
[9/20/23, 8:52:58 AM] Anupa/diya: https://www.internetforall.gov/program/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program
[9/20/23, 8:55:07 AM] Anupa/diya: Many farmers have no access or very little access to internet. We should in parallel if we agree as a group look at internet access. There is no point of building a system where the key stakeholders have no access for say because there is no way they can be included due to no connectivity
[9/20/23, 9:02:29 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Hello to all. Happy to be involved in this guild. Exciting times.
[9/20/23, 9:03:05 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @918017107841 I used to distribute satellite internet in rural areas in Mexico for 2 years. We got bought out by a local provider in 2015/2016
[9/20/23, 9:03:11 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I know the landscape pretty well.
[9/20/23, 9:03:42 AM] Vlatko Gigov: As it happens to be, our vendor Hughes also operates satellite internet in Brazil 😜
[9/20/23, 9:03:58 AM] Anupa/diya: This is fantastic ! Gary needs this confirmation to send it to the authorities. We will need some kind of tech to suport this.
[9/20/23, 9:04:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Can we have a chat if you are free next week ?
[9/20/23, 9:08:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Definitely, I’m available beginning of the week. Have some pretty interesting concepts to share with you all. Gotta dust off my drive. 💪

I am exercising my personal autonomy by not get involving in that initiative as I am already spread too thin. Good luck and God Speed 🙂🙏
[9/20/23, 1:20:53 PM] Gary Teh: Just report your contributions to officials channels for governance token awards when contributions have been made
[9/20/23, 1:24:32 PM] Anupa/diya: That's why I didn't even ask you . Once they are any signals I will inform the group if it's worth exploring.
[9/20/23, 1:27:17 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s see, maybe we can do a barter arrangement: internet for nibs. But we’ll discuss this on Monday. It’s important we move along the SDG’s and contribute to their communities.

I am too busy to summarize the discussion
[9/20/23, 1:36:31 PM] Gary Teh: Once you figured out and finalized amongst yourself what is it exactly you want to contribute in terms of SDG feel free to communicate with @5511982667030 about it

If she gives thumbs up you get introduced by her to the business developer on the cooperative side 

I am not going to be involved 

Also please note @5511982667030 is very busy and will not respond so please keep your communication short and concise 

If you need help with being short and concise, ChatGpt has been very helpful 🙂🙏

Only thing you need to let me know what is it that you contributed and which rubric category it falls under so that I can update ledger when I get time
[9/20/23, 2:46:12 PM] Gary Teh: Actually the local public/private institution (Cacao innovation center and Sol du Bahia) are already providing the requirement confirmation 

And we have agreed to go with them for FDA requirements 

They mentioned they are open to donations and are registered as charity in USA for tax write offs

[9/21/23, 6:45:55 AM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 since you wrote most of the text, it's best you check with her on what are the factual points. I can send the website text on a document.  She can edit and add
[9/21/23, 6:46:27 AM] Anupa/diya: The text has been added but some of the tech stuff is inbuilt wix layout
[9/21/23, 6:48:18 AM] Gary Teh: She has access to wix 

She can edit there directly
[9/21/23, 6:48:52 AM] Gary Teh: Her background is in UX design 

She should be able to figure things out
[9/21/23, 6:49:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Does she have access photos which we can use on the website

[9/21/23, 7:59:43 PM] Val Lapidus: more callout that marketing is not something we do

[9/21/23, 8:17:11 PM] Gary Teh: Hey folks please welcome @557191035605 who is based here in Ilheus who is very familiar with local customs here in Ilheus 

@557191035605 will help correct the factual errors we find here on the Agroverse.shop website 🙂🙏
[9/21/23, 8:18:20 PM] Val Lapidus: going to provide following feedback to designer: Option 3, but with following adjustments: 

There needs to be something that points out that we don't have marketing/retailer costs with Agroverse model, I know it's difficult to represent 0 in physical form, so if you want to assign a value of .5% to Retailer/Marketing respectively you can take one away from the DAO.

The order for the items needs to be same: 
major distro model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer, Marketing
agroverse model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer (0%), Marketing (0%), DAO.

The coloring for each needs to match so for Farmer in both models, should have same color, Trasport in both models should have same color, and etc....  We want people to be easily able to compare.  I'm actually not sure about this one, so you can give me two options one where colors from item to item align, and one where it doesn't.

Thank you.

    - LinkedIn: Attract more supporters who will contribute time and effort to build out Agroverse project

    - Instagram micro-influencer accounts: Attract buyers to our official website
    - TikTok micro-influencers accounts: Attract buyers to our official website
    - Amazon.com: organic buyers based on keyword optimization to our store front on Amazon.com

[9/28/23, 2:05:29 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We don't have a specific page on the section "About Us". It lays on the home. Maybe it will be too large for what we have right now (wide image). So I will need to come up with content to explain this infographic, or else it will be just a colourful image floating there.
[9/28/23, 2:06:12 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @16468233438 it would be great to have you for the meeting today. So I can show the things I am working on as well.
[9/28/23, 2:14:03 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @16468233438 I took over the site content and the visual gaps. I've been prioritizing the content and the font changes. But I have been doing other changes in the home. I still need to check who it changes format depending on the computer, as it was Wix was supposed to be responsive. As it was not made "mobile first", I will need to fix the mobile later as well.
[9/28/23, 2:40:35 PM] Gary Teh: Hi @557191035605 

@16468233438 is focused on the operations side of things
    - vendors 
    - packaging
    - logistics and shipping
    - storage

The session this afternoon happening within the @120363171654864846@g.us is focused on social media market. Let's not drag him into that session. 🙂🙏

Still getting used to the groups and amounts of messages.
[9/28/23, 3:57:14 PM] Gary Teh: I think you are critical for Operations and Landing pages.

[9/29/23, 5:13:25 PM] Gary Teh: I am merging @120363171654864846@g.us into this channel since bulk of the folks in that channel have been booted from that guild for not being active or spread too thin and there is a huge overlap between these two groups.

I am proceeding to do the merge now

[9/29/23, 5:19:43 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Hello. I just finished a class. So, that is why it is important to have a strategy and tie the knots. So it makes sense. I will see more about it once my working day is over.

He is extreme. Cycled with his bicycle from Alaska to Ushuaia over a 5 year period

https://www.facebook.com/reel/1435490530373132?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw
[9/30/23, 2:42:23 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 could you share the link to the 10K followers account you created and the heuristics you followed?
[9/30/23, 2:47:59 PM] Suheil - Europe: Wts heuristic hhhh
[9/30/23, 2:48:45 PM] Suheil - Europe: So what we tell peolple: stop using nestle back up agroverse?🤣🤣
[9/30/23, 2:49:11 PM] Suheil - Europe: I don't create anything I'm only a maestro 🤣🤣
[9/30/23, 2:49:51 PM] Suheil - Europe: I only know how to source the right team mate for executing hhhh https://instagram.com/stocken_ar?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==

[9/30/23, 2:51:07 PM] Gary Teh: Who was doing the actual execution for that account?
[9/30/23, 2:52:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: Auto scheduler  app

All we needed is to sit once a month , 2 of us and upload all months content according to our p2p activity 


It's not by just posting the post on Instagram that alone came traffic

With each post going out we were all over telegram groups communities dispersing the link ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 2:54:33 PM] Suheil - Europe: Before opening the insta page we spent half a year only networking with related communities and gaining trust and credibility :)
[9/30/23, 2:55:16 PM] Suheil - Europe: Dispersing the projects pages in many conferences
[9/30/23, 2:55:18 PM] Suheil - Europe: Meet ups
[9/30/23, 2:55:20 PM] Suheil - Europe: Events
[9/30/23, 2:55:57 PM] Gary Teh: Now the key question is how many of these telegram groups actually have people who follow keto diet or nutrition healthy lifestyle 

And more importantly based in USA

We might end up barking up the wrong tree hitting the groups and meetups ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 2:57:36 PM] Suheil - Europe: Not relevant at all 


I just gave u example of how
[9/30/23, 2:58:36 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s listen to what @557391090002 has to share this coming Monday 

Incorporate his input into a full scale social marketing strategy

Then the Monday after next you walk us through what you came up with ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 2:59:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: You want the client


Client is in US

Well we should penetrate US based dieto keto sports groups communities if it was fb
Telegram
Go to a gym event meet-up like during tasters that would've been ideal to push people to Instagram or any other online
[9/30/23, 3:01:25 PM] Suheil - Europe: My easiest way was always "attacking " conferences with QR code on my phone throwing it at everyone and anyone for people to like follow ect...
[9/30/23, 3:07:39 PM] Gary Teh: I think every account of a sort Instagram/ Facebook or any social media platform has its own unique form of expression.

At the end of the day is expression “Marketing”

The key I’ll recommend will be **“how/which” aspects *** you’ll like to “show” integrate the product in this case “Agroverse” to the public. 

Keep it simple and send the message out there for the public. If is to sell an image, if is to give to others the product benefits or to put out there a message to the world community !

**Ex: trees 🌳 cocoa 🫘 local’s displayed of product and regional growth details of its made of origin, ** 
as we all know todays world we mainly are thriving to be organic in all aspects in life in this case “ agroverse” agriculture 👩🏻‍🌾
[9/30/23, 3:09:15 PM] Gary Teh: @13054848967 I finally found time to read through what you posted about Instagram account management 

Would you mind further expanding on what you have already shared so far?

Also do you think you might be able to join our Monday zoom hangout session 

@557391090002 will be sharing his thoughts 

I would like for you to share yours too 

That way when @31641075825 compiles the plan it’s comprehensive
‎[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: If is cocoa only cocoa pictures and videos not with pineapple 🍍 or bananas or recipes. I think focus is ideal on only cocoa images
[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: Imágenes has to sell the product.
[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: Is cocoa and agriculture 👩🏻‍🌾 documentaries
[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: Recipes will be on add “stories” or just top 5.

The main focus is cocoa and cocoa bean 🫘

[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: Question should the Instagram marketing etc social medias be more “commercialized” like Starbucks etc or ….. “environmental” conservatives of agriculture like charts dry outs.
[9/30/23, 3:11:24 PM] Gary Teh: If is to sell product has to be commercialize but depending on The aspect your aiming for

[9/30/23, 3:23:08 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 have you already read the document that Iris created priorly

It’s has a week by week break down on the general tasks items to execute upon 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SFaC65kSptU7rHSiM0F6sGOVlUxi3_Cs7QX2fU7cjs/edit

Could you take a look before Monday so that on Monday we can figure out what else is missing or should be tweaked from that one
[9/30/23, 7:14:10 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/30/23, 7:51:42 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 we will need to find time to consider the following next week

*item 1: return policy*
How do we handle when a customer bought a bag of cacao nibs is not satisfied and wants a return?

*item 2*
Recall policy, when we are issued a notice for recall by FDA for issues they have identified
[9/30/23, 7:21:00 PM] Suheil - Europe: I did not I will make sure to do before our Monday 🙏
[9/30/23, 8:14:47 PM] Gary Teh: Please come prepared as you are planning to play the role maestro on the social media marketing side, it becomes your responsibility to incorporate into your mental model all the inputs from other DAO members regarding this matter and weigh the proposer option forward
‎[9/30/23, 8:36:47 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 10:15:19 PM] Val Lapidus: 1: Give money back.  Keep product.
2: we need to track shipping date with lot number to ensure traceability
[9/30/23, 10:17:29 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes still have
[9/30/23, 10:44:58 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! 

number 1: for every refund we have to sell 5 to cover the cost of 1 refund 

We will go broke really fast like this
[9/30/23, 10:46:01 PM] Gary Teh: Also what is to prevent a buyer from just exploiting the system and draining our vault dry like this?
[9/30/23, 10:48:12 PM] Gary Teh: If I were a hacker I would do precisely that 

Order all the available inventory and then ask for everything to be returned. So I get all my money back and then keep the inventory

We are dealing with web3 folks some of whom are mentally geared towards hacking of all forms to draft DAO vaults ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 11:29:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Not much else we can do here.  We can say we don't accept refunds
[9/30/23, 11:29:34 PM] Val Lapidus: If we notice a trend we can ban a customer
[9/30/23, 11:30:05 PM] Val Lapidus: I hope no one orders all inventory

[10/1/23, 5:29:05 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think we need to create a seperate whats app channel, that will not allow any conversation, but will act as a repository for all FDA compliance items required by the FDA.  Or we could do a google group / folder

[10/1/23, 5:49:18 PM] Val Lapidus: to comply with FSMA standards we will need the following items, As I come across more items I will edit and update this post:

HACCP plan
Lot records for each individual imported item, with details of origin
shipping/receiving/storage logs
Lot #ing system: XXX-TTTT
XXX: uniq 3 digit ID of source farm *we should publish our FARM ID's to our website
TTTT: 2 digit month/2 digit year of receipt to US based warehousing
We need to retain a small amount (4-8 oz) of product from every lot #, that we can then utilize for testing.
A process document detailing how the product is packaged at farm, how it is shipped, how it is received in the US, How it is stored in the US upon receipt, how it is then taken to a commercial kitchen to be repackaged, how it is then stored, and then how it is shipped.
[10/1/23, 5:54:25 PM] Gary Teh: I have created a GitHub repository to store all food safety records

The wrong crowd is those we call the nature loving *tree huggers* aka the hippies. Most of them are f**king broke. Aka Steve Jobs before Apple was founded 

The folks we should be targeting are the *biohackers* the hard charging high tech executives that really want to optimize the use of their time, energy and resources with lots of cash to throw around. Aka Steve Jobs after Apple was founded ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/23, 7:38:54 PM] Gary Teh: We are already registered with the FDA as an importer

A document that defines our process for personelle requirements, that details: personal protective gear: beard covers, gloves, mask, hair net.  
requirements related to personal hygene, no open sores or legions unless covered by an impermeable covering, hand washing, no jewelery, no storing of clothing/personal belongins not in areas where food is exposed or equiments is washed, no eating, chewing gum, using tobaco, or smoking in those areas either.
For storage Need to create a log book for checking our storage facility: Checking on a regular basis for pests and pest infestation (unclear what a regular basis is)

I foresee another 2 hours tommorrow on the phone to fix the return policy.
[10/5/23, 7:37:55 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 when you get the chance could you update the tasting notes for the Santa Fe ana and the Cooperative Cabruca samples on this tasting note document?

They are equating cacao nibs to wine. The spectrum of taste is very wide and sophisticated

[10/6/23, 8:37:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This is the reference or the final logo?
[10/6/23, 8:42:23 PM] Gary Teh: This is the logo I found on google
[10/6/23, 8:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: Once Val finished collecting the data within the next two hours we will know which variant of cacao nibs we will be going with and which logo we will be using
[10/6/23, 8:44:34 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Nice. I'm anxious :) So I can add to the brand guide
[10/6/23, 8:44:43 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I need it as soon as you finish :)
[10/6/23, 8:47:50 PM] Gary Teh: Ok!
[10/6/23, 9:07:50 PM] Val Lapidus: It's a split
[10/6/23, 9:08:04 PM] Val Lapidus: 5 people for 9 5 for 8
[10/6/23, 9:08:40 PM] Val Lapidus: I think we should with this shipment.  Purchase both. In order to sell number 9. We have to redo our packaging
[10/6/23, 9:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: We should purchase 100 kilos of number eight utilize our available packaging.  And then change our packaging to accommodate for number nine
[10/6/23, 9:12:37 PM] Gary Teh: Huh. I am confused by your text 

#9: how many KG?
#8: how many KG?
[10/6/23, 9:13:00 PM] Val Lapidus: 100 each
[10/6/23, 9:14:04 PM] Gary Teh: Are you sure you have enough storage in our Californian facility?

Why not the following?

#9: 50Kg
#8: 50Kg ‎<This message was edited>
[10/6/23, 9:15:22 PM] Gary Teh: Also 
    *Item 1* - Brazilian side is not expecting 200kg for shipment #2

    *Item 2* - customs clearance via air freight hasn’t been tested yet 

Let’s go as we have planned according to our ramp up schedule ‎<This message was edited>
[10/6/23, 9:23:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Then I think we need to do number eight 100 kilos
[10/6/23, 9:23:30 PM] Val Lapidus: Because our packaging is not made for number 9
[10/6/23, 9:39:20 PM] Gary Teh: So for shipment #2?

#8: 100kg
#9: 0kg ‎<This message was edited>

[10/6/23, 10:23:38 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s do 

#9 - 50Kg
#8 - 50Kg 

We should give #9 and #8 separate names to help consumers differentiate between the two of them

Let’s chat on Monday
[10/7/23, 12:19:34 AM] Val Lapidus: We will need to order new packaging.  Or put stickers covering current
[10/7/23, 12:20:16 AM] Gary Teh: Maybe just put a sticker. But first figure out what is the differentiation

[10/9/23, 2:39:49 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I have a question...I saw the two products bags, one Premium and the other would be the regular, right? Don't they have any color difference or a label "Premium"? I ask this because I noticed in the Agroverse shop page it was not mentioned in the title as well.
[10/9/23, 2:40:04 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔
[10/9/23, 2:40:24 PM] Gary Teh: This is because premium is just speculation right now. We are not rolling that out yet. Needs more market research. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/10/23, 12:35:41 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 I was thinking through our marketing

At the top of the marketing funnel, It’s basically about getting the most *amount of eyeballs* on our messaging using the *least amount of resources* 

The recipe that most naturally fits the bill is *controversy* 

What is the most extreme, most controversial, most polarizing and yet still factually correct and relevant piece of messaging we can use to get the Agroverse story out there?

We really don’t want to spend all our time and effort coming up with messaging that basically triggers off *zero emotional response* ‎<This message was edited>

Marketing materials we will need
    - poster 1: benefits of drinking cacao during network session 
    - poster 2: about Agroverse and TrueSight DAO
    - poster 3: Call to action: 
        - buy our cacao

[10/10/23, 9:14:59 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think something we will need to do to get our product to be searchable on Amazon, is buy it ourselves a few hundred times.  Amazon algorithms prioritize best sellers in searches.  so if we can get each DAO member to make a purchase, then we will refund them their purchase (if they want to be refunded) *if not they should get DAO tokens* then this will certainly drive up our search in Amazon.
[10/10/23, 9:15:19 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to make sure that we do it steadily though.
[10/10/23, 9:15:48 PM] Val Lapidus: there is an algorithm to how Amazon does this, I have a friend that I would like to consult with us on this
[10/10/23, 9:15:58 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! That is exactly what is my mind just now 

We will kick start that campaign as soon as we get the final parts of our listings fixed

[10/11/23, 12:59:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Hello guys, I wanted to share something with you all. It concerns the brand identity and also the way you all speak about Agroverse. The more aligned vision people have about the Agroverse, the better for the brand. What I am about to comment is based on what I've read so far and understood by the documentation and the uses of certain terminologies. If you feel we should discuss it further, I will be happy to help.
[10/11/23, 12:59:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I was asked a paragraph about Agroverse. So I went to the whitepaper and the site.

‎[10/11/23, 1:00:50 PM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[10/11/23, 1:01:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If I make a fusion of what is in the paper and what is in the site (that has a more selling interest because we talk about the product right now) I have this:
[10/11/23, 1:01:44 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Agroverse is a transparent direct-to-consumer agricultural distribution network that connects small-scale farmers in developing societies with people around the world who are concerned about the environment, their health, and sustainability. We have emerged out of the necessity to rethink food consumption and the commitment to work together with economically disadvantaged production communities, transforming the agricultural economy into a collaborative endeavor.
[10/11/23, 1:02:08 PM] Gary Teh: I have also granted you access to the white paper 🙂🙏

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit
[10/11/23, 1:03:03 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I changed the small-scale farmers - international market to people who are interested in the environment, their health and sustainability. We use words as: community, building something together, so connecting farmers to people worldwide speaks more of community than farmers- international market.
[10/11/23, 1:03:35 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩🙏
[10/11/23, 1:04:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The second point is the term "marginalized". It can be seen as a problem due to developed countries and underdeveloping and developed ones historical perspective. So I think we should avoid using this world in the company context.
[10/11/23, 1:04:40 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! Let’s remove it 🙂🙏

[10/11/23, 1:06:11 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Vulnarable: need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, or risk of abuse or neglect."
[10/11/23, 1:06:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It still gets the idea of "we are a rich country helping the poor"
[10/11/23, 1:06:42 PM] Emelin - Bahia: That is from where in my opinion, Agroverse has to run from.
[10/11/23, 1:06:48 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is not a NGO.
[10/11/23, 1:07:10 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So to hear that a company is helping the vulnerable in South America but profiting from this, can be a thing.
[10/11/23, 1:07:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Due to historical relationships.
[10/11/23, 1:07:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will be adding this to the brand guide so we all stay on the same page and don't jeopardize the company's image by misinformation.
[10/11/23, 1:08:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is also a voice and tone thing to add.
[10/11/23, 1:08:53 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect! Please also feel free to remove inappropriate terminologies from our Agroverse whitepaper

You have editing rights to that too 🙂🙏
[10/11/23, 1:09:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We can use: Disadvantaged communities or economically disadvantaged communities.
[10/11/23, 1:09:16 PM] Emelin - Bahia: because we are talking about the farmers.
[10/11/23, 1:09:23 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s use disadvantaged
[10/11/23, 1:09:49 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is respectful.

Me and @16468233438 were chatting about how we should be supporting the civilians of both Isreal and Palestine

However seems like there is already alot of support for the civilians in Isreal, we figured we should balance things out alittle by offering support for folks in Palestine

[10/13/23, 6:38:11 PM] Gary Teh: Just you and myself for now.
[10/13/23, 6:38:37 PM] Val Lapidus: My guess is will probably need a minimum order
[10/13/23, 6:38:37 PM] Gary Teh: If we gain more traction with our cacao nibs, we can print more t-Shirts for supporters that get recruited

[10/13/23, 6:42:48 PM] Val Lapidus: Whoever is designing the shirt, they need to know that it's for screen printing

    - *marketing channels* where awareness and education takes place

[10/16/23, 7:03:54 PM] Emelin - Bahia: My advice here is to keep the white as background as much as possible to align with Dao as well.

[10/16/23, 9:01:24 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes
[10/16/23, 9:01:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It will also bring a texture

[10/16/23, 9:30:36 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 direct this question formally to Orlantildes (the president of the coop) when you get introduced to him on Wednesday 

If you want to do an informal query about Bahia infrastructure ask @557391090002. He handles business development for the coop

There are facilities for this in Bahia to handle it

@5511982667030 gate keeps the interfacing between our organization and the cooperative to ensure Orlantildes does not get flooded by informal unstructured requests 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/20/23, 1:21:29 AM] Anupa/diya: @31641075825 do you want to a run _ on the website I had created this section where people can submit their recipes.
[10/20/23, 1:22:01 AM] Anupa/diya: Maybe we can do a quick campaign #tastethevibe encouraging the community to share recipes.
[10/20/23, 2:49:24 AM] Gary Teh: Video recordings of visitors to agroverse.shop is starting to pour in. Please visit inspectlet to review the recordings

[10/20/23, 2:15:53 PM] Val Lapidus: just spent 1 hour, straining and cleaning the hot chocolate
[10/20/23, 2:16:31 PM] Val Lapidus: re-boiling now
[10/20/23, 2:29:23 PM] Val Lapidus: @557191035605 I love the idea of the tribal face paint that sounds amazing
[10/20/23, 2:37:07 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 anyway for us to borrow a tablet??
[10/20/23, 2:37:46 PM] Val Lapidus: I think I have one
[10/20/23, 2:37:59 PM] Val Lapidus: Do we need a table?
[10/20/23, 2:39:24 PM] Val Lapidus: we will have to do cheese cloth straining
[10/20/23, 2:39:27 PM] Val Lapidus: it's still gritty
[10/20/23, 2:55:30 PM] Gary Teh: To be safe let’s bring a table
[10/20/23, 2:55:38 PM] Gary Teh: Ok

[10/20/23, 5:03:37 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. I guess. It is time for me to experiment with being the Leather Tramp along Haight street.

Or actually what will be really fun is to give our free hot chocolate drink along ocean beach one of these weekends around sunset time wearing our T-Shirt.
[10/20/23, 5:05:37 PM] Val Lapidus: Or we could do samples and sell?
[10/20/23, 5:05:59 PM] Gary Teh: Give samples and sell the bags!! 🤩
[10/20/23, 5:23:35 PM] Anupa/diya: Will you guys have some time to video record some feedback?

[10/21/23, 4:04:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Feedback from last night:
We need to align on which CTA(s) we are testing or trying to convey.  Subscription? Purchase? Recruitment?

The CTA should be aligned to who the audience is.  If it's tech people, we should be recruiting.  

If the CTA is buy or follow, the actual product should be sampled and used.  Our product is cacao, we need to give samples of the nibs.  Hot chocolate can be an enticer, but isn't what we are selling.

We should not be talking about how the coco nibs won awards.  When we are not selling those.

We need to ensure with the host that we will be given time to announce before or after.

We need to ensure our placement is to greet people as they walk in.  We were at the very end of the venue, which caused people to come in and block the path to get to us.  

We need to think about bringing a different product.  Cacao nibs are a niche product and may be a difficult sell.
[10/21/23, 4:05:26 PM] Gary Teh: But should we be recruiting instead of selling to Tech People?
[10/21/23, 4:05:59 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes if it's tech our goal should be follow insta or recruit
[10/21/23, 4:06:50 PM] Gary Teh: I think we should just focus our CTA on selling. When I ran my own prior growth experiments having two conflict CTAs causes conversion rate to drop by 75%
[10/21/23, 4:07:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Selling what?
[10/21/23, 4:07:11 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/21/23, 4:07:19 PM] Gary Teh: Cacao nibs
[10/21/23, 4:07:32 PM] Val Lapidus: Did we have cacao nibs with us? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:07:52 PM] Val Lapidus: How are we selling a product if we aren't allowing people to see/touch it
[10/21/23, 4:07:59 PM] Gary Teh: Yesterday no. Let's try to prepare 5 bags for each of the 2 events.

We can use from the 5kg we currently have just to test conversion rate ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Why do you think we will achieve sales within a group of tech people gathered for an event that that has nothing to do with our product?
[10/21/23, 4:10:00 PM] Gary Teh: I think we need to figure out a short script that we just stick to that works. 

Otherwise if we want to scale this event if and when it works, getting professional folks who are skilled in delivering scripts versus getting random folks who don't need to deliver scripts is way way harder.
[10/21/23, 4:10:42 PM] Val Lapidus: Before we can settle on a scrip we need to align on our primary goal
[10/21/23, 4:10:55 PM] Gary Teh: No harm trying. Otherwise no reason even for us to be there at the event. We are already able to get contributors without sponsoring events, why drive up our fiat operating expenses?

Also there arent really alot of slots where engineering contributors can come into contribute in our DAO right now ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:11:05 PM] Gary Teh: Sell
[10/21/23, 4:12:27 PM] Val Lapidus: I am saying that we won't get sales here but we should use this to gain followers, and get interest in how we are using tech within the project
[10/21/23, 4:12:59 PM] Gary Teh: Get them on the instagram. The goal is to eventually convert them to buyers
[10/21/23, 4:13:10 PM] Val Lapidus: For tech events Our CTA should be followers on insta.  And our main point should be how we use the blockchain
[10/21/23, 4:13:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Followers get us exposure.  Exposure gets us sales
[10/21/23, 4:14:14 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is tech approach is too boring
[10/21/23, 4:14:53 PM] Val Lapidus: Your excitement to get sales at these events does not make sense.  As you pointed out within your feedback.  The person I suggested should purchase was uncomfortable but then you mention give us a follow, and they were receptive
[10/21/23, 4:14:56 PM] Gary Teh: I haven't heard anyone from last night coming to me asking about how the tech part of the project actually works. They are all mainly interested in finding out about the farmers and how we got pass the legal side as well as the sourcing side
[10/21/23, 4:15:23 PM] Gary Teh: Let me clarify

First physical contact > instagram follow > Sales

That is the funnel I am referring to when I mean sales ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:15:45 PM] Val Lapidus: Sure so our cta is followers
[10/21/23, 4:16:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok so what should ouressage be
[10/21/23, 4:16:10 PM] Val Lapidus: Message
[10/21/23, 4:16:34 PM] Gary Teh: I am not interested in this funnel for our in real life events

First physical contact > instagram follow > Contributors

We are getting inbound people curious and interested without doing In real life events ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:18:20 PM] Val Lapidus: I suggest we talk about the actual value of using the blockchain.  And I'm sorry you think it's boring.  It's not.  It's actual utility of the blockchain, that few people know.  People who I spoke to loved the ledger as the mechanisim for tracivility.  At least 6 people asked for more info
[10/21/23, 4:19:22 PM] Gary Teh: These are the two I just pulled out from my ass. Feel free to throw in more.

    > Chocolate that helps you get in shape
    > Enough with the sugared water, taste real chocolate
[10/21/23, 4:19:22 PM] Val Lapidus: And your secondary message should be the logistical aspect and legal aspect
[10/21/23, 4:19:39 PM] Gary Teh: Just throw in CTAs you have in mind, we will subject it to DAO voting
We will pick the top two that gets the most vote and stick it to the containers

    - one on Thursday
    - one on Friday ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:20:54 PM] Val Lapidus: I immediately vote against those two: 

The two messages I think we should push:

Use blockchain for tracking
Legal aspects of import

Leading to: 
Follow us on insta ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:23:29 PM] Gary Teh: Since we have two events, let's just do one version on Thursday and one version on Friday

We will see how many people scan on each day. Its simple
[10/21/23, 4:23:40 PM] Gary Teh: Demographic is quite similar
‎[10/21/23, 4:24:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 4:25:29 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎POLL:
Which messaging should we use at events with technical attendees, to drive insta followers
‎OPTION: Healthier food with no sugar/healthier you (1 vote)
‎OPTION: We use blockchain technology/elements involved in import/export (1 vote)

[10/21/23, 4:46:01 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to focus on audience fit.  These people are tech.  If you want to drive sales the. Events we should go to are keto meetups/events.  Not ones that we created, but we need to contact existing and get them to allow to sponsor.  Going to tech events and trying to sell a product that they have not expressed interest in is a futile exercise reminiscent of Sisyphus
[10/21/23, 4:46:40 PM] Gary Teh: Shall I just let them know that we are cancelling sponsorship for those two events then?

There are only techies in the bay area ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:48:26 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't know. I don't think you should. I think we need to realign what what are messaging and CTA is?  And I disagree with you. The Bay area does not have just techies.  And also the group of techies and keto followers is not mutually exclusive.  But keto does not necessarily have a high level of intersection with techie
‎[10/21/23, 4:52:14 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 4:53:13 PM] Gary Teh: Let's just test 1 CTA on Thursday and the other on Friday. 
I see it as an AB test
We will go with whichever CTA that better converts at this tech events.

Goal: *get more instagram followers*

More time is wasted on agonizing over which option is better than just simply testing two and then moving on quickly. I have seen this happen many times before in growth teams ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 4:59:45 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok
[10/21/23, 4:59:54 PM] Val Lapidus: So Thursday will be which?
[10/21/23, 5:02:39 PM] Gary Teh: Let's do yours first. Its friendly territory since its basically the web3 crowd at Edge and Node
[10/21/23, 5:03:12 PM] Gary Teh: The folks at HackerDojo mentioned they haven't heard anybody talk about cryptocurrency at all for the past 6 months.
[10/21/23, 5:08:00 PM] Val Lapidus: Maybe hacker dojo would be a better venue if they haven't heard it for 6 months. Maybe it's time to rehash
[10/21/23, 5:08:41 PM] Gary Teh: 👊
[10/21/23, 5:08:56 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, FYI. Other issue that I have with your message.  Is when delivering a message of a healthier you. I'm not the right person to deliver that message.
[10/21/23, 5:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't exactly look like the pinnacle of health
[10/21/23, 5:09:45 PM] Gary Teh: How much weigh have you lost so far?

Just say my friend gary convinced me to go on this keto cacao experiment

I have lost X lb so far after Y number of weeks. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/21/23, 5:12:31 PM] Val Lapidus: See I could see that working but there needs to be an actual story of how cacao is actually helping.  And it has to be an honest story
[10/21/23, 5:12:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Right now all the cacao is doing is keeping my stress level high
[10/21/23, 5:13:21 PM] Gary Teh: That bad??
[10/21/23, 5:13:41 PM] Val Lapidus: Nah I can manage
[10/21/23, 5:13:52 PM] Gary Teh: What about using cacao to supplement your diet since its rich in saturated fat?
[10/21/23, 5:14:28 PM] Val Lapidus: We have to do research on this and find the right talking points for it. I don't mind doing it but we need to further expand on this and be able to talk about why this is better
‎[10/21/23, 5:15:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 5:17:53 PM] Gary Teh: or perhaps the story would be you are trying to adopt a healthier diet by cutting out sugar and caffiene which is what I observe you already doing and you did use cacao powder in your cooking the last few times I was there

Also this cacao drink does not include sugar ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 5:21:08 PM] Val Lapidus: I prefer not to use bulletproof as the mechanism. Bulletproof diet is a fad and widely regarded as b******* by the medical community.  There is some evidence about utilizing certain types of fats to help control hunger in the mainstream community

[10/22/23, 7:25:55 AM] Suheil - Europe: my input on piing pong of CTA at events.

Offline event is to build the community. if its a web3 tech event then i am gearing more towards val that it not about selling them the cacaao nibs . it is about pitching our real life use case of how we , as “on-chain” community following DAO principles and bootstrapping a traditional business by contributions. how we are doing it today vs how we envision scalability using deep tech such as blockchain / AI ….

it is not about “recruiting” engineers to come code for truesight or agroverse. it’s about raising awareness how we leverage tech for x y z reasons…
‎[10/22/23, 12:42:27 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[10/22/23, 12:43:35 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩
[10/22/23, 12:51:20 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 maybe what we should think about is.  At the farmers market we sell hot chocolate as well.  We can calculate our cost per cup and put a significant markup on it.
[10/22/23, 12:51:52 PM] Val Lapidus: We can give out samples of the hot chocolate.

[10/22/23, 12:56:24 PM] Val Lapidus: Ty. The cuteness comes from his mom
[10/22/23, 1:03:15 PM] Emelin - Bahia: From both, I am sure 🙏🏾
[10/22/23, 1:15:49 PM] Val Lapidus: @557191035605 I know there is a recipe for hot chocolate that has cayane pepper 🌶️ in it.  Do you happen to know it?
[10/22/23, 1:16:25 PM] Val Lapidus: (yes I know how to Google, but I would prefer to get an idea of something authentic from Brazil)
[10/22/23, 1:18:36 PM] Val Lapidus: If I make this recipe and someone asks me:  how did you learn about this.  I can respond with "I googled it". Or a much better and captivating response would be, this recipe comes from one of the contributors to the agroverse community, Emelin, who lives in brazil.  It is a recipe that has been passed down for 12 generations ‎<This message was edited>
[10/22/23, 1:23:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I have eaten solid chocolate with pepper. It is so good 🥹
[10/22/23, 1:25:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I don't have a recipe from my 12th generation with pepper. But it is as famous as Brazil having a whole soap opera called "chocolate with pepper"
[10/22/23, 1:25:54 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is more common to eat it than drink it here in northeast.
[10/22/23, 1:26:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: But Brazil is huge.
[10/22/23, 1:26:27 PM] Val Lapidus: @557391090002 do you have a secret hot chocolate recipe that your grandmother passed down to you?
[10/22/23, 1:26:39 PM] Val Lapidus: I totally understand. Thank you!
[10/22/23, 1:27:06 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Hot drinks are more common in cold places. Although we do consume a lot of coffee
[10/22/23, 1:30:33 PM] Val Lapidus: Do we know anyone in the south of Brazil? It gets cold there right?

[10/23/23, 12:25:56 PM] Suheil - Europe: no i am just asking i am not analysis or pre - imagining . yes ok i am with you 100 % on that. if the point is to guide others to do it. 

but my deeper question, is why you will need it for others to make it and who are the others that will need to open binance account ? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/23, 12:27:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: i think it would be simpler if we take care of this part and manage the USDT flow until cashing it out to concerned stakeholders bank account
[10/23/23, 12:28:08 PM] Gary Teh: The folks who will need yo figure out how to open an account in the near future. 

@557391090002, @557191035605 @5511982667030
[10/23/23, 12:28:51 PM] Gary Teh: Ok dude. Go ahead and create the video tutorial till the point of cashing out the USDt to a Brazilian bank account and then verifying the money is in the Brazilian bank account 🙂🙏
[10/23/23, 12:29:56 PM] Suheil - Europe: i didnt propose to create the video . i propose to open truesight dao braziilian verified account and manage the fiat payouts to concerned party?
[10/23/23, 12:30:31 PM] Gary Teh: He is creating the tutorial for that too 🤣
[10/23/23, 12:30:41 PM] Suheil - Europe: where the fiiat needs to fall down end of the road, the cooperative right?
[10/23/23, 12:31:08 PM] Suheil - Europe: again, i am not discussing anything about making a video, i am discussing about managing truesights dao own binance account
[10/23/23, 12:31:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: unless you want to ask others “ yo guyz go open binance and we will send u there and theen u are responsiible about “fiating it “ to your own personal bank accoount… i get it right? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/23, 12:33:38 PM] Suheil - Europe: if we are talking about videos, binance invested in proo production already and iits all there e.g —> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23z1xlD-9YY
[10/23/23, 12:33:41 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective in the future @557191035605 @557391090002 and @5511982667030 should be able to just learn to deal with the USDT off ramp when they cash out their governance tokens
[10/23/23, 12:34:36 PM] Suheil - Europe: yaaa but not by pushing them to rely on binance and i hope we will never have Truesight tokens on centralized platforms such as binance 😛
[10/23/23, 12:34:44 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel it would great if there is an financial education to it  . From opening the account to managing it which most people don't.
[10/23/23, 12:34:59 PM] Suheil - Europe: if ur asking my personal opinion 🤷
[10/23/23, 12:35:39 PM] Anupa/diya: I think that's a separate question which we will need to ask the DAO for sure. It's important to equip members before that when they are going to make that decision
[10/23/23, 12:35:45 PM] Gary Teh: Enlighten me. What is wrong with Binance? 🤔
[10/23/23, 12:37:21 PM] Suheil - Europe: nthn personal against binance. just personal against centralized entities , maybe its “noot my fault” that i grew up with psyc problems from centralized entity i think they should create new medical analysis for such problems 😛 hhhhh
[10/23/23, 12:37:43 PM] Anupa/diya: Whatever we use, the dao members need to do their own individual research before we go ahead. We should push people to research 🤣🤣
[10/23/23, 12:38:36 PM] Gary Teh: How do you propose to off ramp crypto to UsDT to your personal bank account without one of these official off-ramps? 

The private (black market) off-ramps charge a lot
[10/23/23, 12:38:42 PM] Suheil - Europe: other than they are surpassiing a strong legal storm at the exact moment
[10/23/23, 12:40:02 PM] Suheil - Europe: remember how i started my discussion about this topic (which i startted it in beer hall) about expressing my hopeless voice of agreeing that for now it is a solution for boostrap / temporary

[10/23/23, 12:41:45 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 and @918017107841 now is your opportunity to help 🤩
[10/23/23, 12:41:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: agaaiin guyz the toopic iis not the video tutorial hhh
[10/23/23, 12:42:05 PM] Suheil - Europe: help in what part exactly
[10/23/23, 12:44:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I know it wasn't but yet is a good idea.
[10/23/23, 12:45:22 PM] Anupa/diya: I agree ! This is an important conversation which we need to have. Decision making is a very important part of a DAO
[10/23/23, 12:45:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. What is the idea 2. The idea source / facts 3. Who need to do it 4. When 5. What we need to have in order to do it (research, people?)
[10/23/23, 12:45:42 PM] Anupa/diya: Members should know right to make that decision
[10/23/23, 12:45:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @31641075825 try to use this model
[10/23/23, 12:46:05 PM] Anupa/diya: Emelin ! I think we can maybe prototype with you
[10/23/23, 12:46:08 PM] Anupa/diya: ?
[10/23/23, 12:46:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: to explain your idea
[10/23/23, 12:46:30 PM] Anupa/diya: About onboarding about web 3 and more ?
[10/23/23, 12:46:31 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, as long as I can get minimum knowledge and finish what I have to.
[10/23/23, 12:46:40 PM] Anupa/diya: @31641075825 what do you think
[10/23/23, 12:46:43 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Any news about the events schedule so I can add to the site?
[10/23/23, 12:47:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I couldn't touch it because of my work but I intend to do it and add the event as soon as I can
[10/23/23, 12:47:06 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I need a list for that.
[10/23/23, 12:47:17 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @918017107841  ❤️
[10/23/23, 12:47:35 PM] Anupa/diya: Exactly.  I feel more that the minimum knowledge, it's the right knowledge
[10/23/23, 12:48:15 PM] Anupa/diya: The template is already made. I am on leave till Sunday. I can just you to the Google doc
[10/23/23, 12:48:52 PM] Anupa/diya: You can start the layout for a template and add in the information. If and when.  Didn't I send it to you. Can you please send me your email address
[10/23/23, 12:48:55 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This is how I like to work. 1. We gather knowledge, talk straight ahead. 2. We break in parts so it can be understood as a process or step by step. 3. We check if it looks simple. 4. If doesn't looks simple we make it simple.
[10/23/23, 12:49:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Maybe it is because I have it hard to understand when keywords are not used.
[10/23/23, 12:50:14 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I understand the word through keywords. Every word contains a lot of different meanings and until we get to sort in which contexts they are being used, communication is lost.
[10/23/23, 12:50:37 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Actually it gave me an idea 🤔
[10/23/23, 12:50:57 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @emelinjung@gmail.com

[10/25/23, 5:33:51 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes we should
[10/25/23, 5:35:19 AM] Suheil - Europe: i saw the possibility iin their back office. we can do that once we have multiple products…yet meanwhile i prefer to risk on building direct front….

We should make it better by being "fresh" : 
- before you attending events we announce  --> during event u live or story

[10/26/23, 11:58:49 PM] Suheil - Europe: Will not lie that our work (with @972543523823 ) due to actual estate is still not coming from the heart 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[10/26/23, 11:59:15 PM] Suheil - Europe: I know we can do better but maaaan situation so fucked lol
[10/26/23, 11:59:19 PM] Suheil - Europe: Sorry for my language
[10/26/23, 11:59:24 PM] Suheil - Europe: But no other way to express
[10/27/23, 12:00:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Things that might help: use our own brand illustration as possible, avoid using dynamic texts too much, texts must come aligned to the left and give some space between the Insta name and the pictures/videos.
[10/27/23, 12:00:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I understand
[10/27/23, 12:01:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I worked the whole day doing social media and these small tips really become mechanic.
[10/27/23, 12:01:13 AM] Suheil - Europe: Agree
[10/27/23, 12:01:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: you can align to the center as well when it matches the proposal.
[10/27/23, 12:01:50 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I forgot to add. I will add, hold on a sec
[10/27/23, 12:02:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Things that might help: use our own brand illustration as possible, avoid using dynamic texts too much, texts must come aligned to the left or centered, and give some space between the Insta name and the pictures/videos.
[10/27/23, 12:02:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Now, copy and paste on the notepad. I can do a checklist if you want as well.
[10/27/23, 12:03:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: it is easier to create things when we have some rules defined. Less time thinking :D more time to rest.

[10/27/23, 12:18:17 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I haven't been able to add the previous events because I've swamped. For this, I say sorry and compromise to post them weekly. If an event pops, just send me guys.
[10/27/23, 12:23:44 AM] Gary Teh: Let me take a look in the morning 🙂🙏
[10/27/23, 12:25:29 AM] Gary Teh: Tickets are not necessary 

They just created the event for marketing purposes
[10/27/23, 12:26:51 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is something that comes with Wix
[10/27/23, 12:32:58 AM] Gary Teh: They just published it on their meetup.com profile

Nothing much we need to do on our end

We are just riding on their marketing efforts by presenting our CTA at their events ‎<This message was edited>
[10/27/23, 12:33:13 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I added the Halloween event on the page, added the Instagram adress in two sections (still think we need to rethink the experience with the tracking your package and share with us your story - because it requires some attention of a social media schedule to show people how to do it and why to do it (a 3 posts slide would work) and sent Suheil two templates that can help with the posting, reminding to use our own identity. The time was 23:20 to 00:29.
[10/27/23, 12:33:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I saw it.
[10/27/23, 12:33:28 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanls
[10/27/23, 12:33:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanks

[10/27/23, 12:36:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Have a nice night/day you all.
[10/27/23, 12:38:08 AM] Gary Teh: That is wonderful!

Will follow up with @16468233438 when I meet him tomorrow to get more details about the night market

Also we are going to be partnering up with Edge and Node for their anniversary celebration event on the 9th of Nov
[10/27/23, 12:39:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Obs: we should have a section with pictures from the events that redirects to the Instagram as well. As it is done in the shop part. Any opportunity we can use to make people curious about Agroverse, we should use.
[10/27/23, 12:39:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wrote some "what I get in return if I go to your event?"
[10/27/23, 12:42:53 AM] Emelin - Bahia: "You will taste our fine cocoa drink and benefit your diet by having the opportunity to talk to our collaborators and learn more about the world of cocoa."
[10/27/23, 12:43:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: so if people come asking :) ...You know.
[10/27/23, 12:43:19 AM] Emelin - Bahia: This should follow as well to social media.
[10/27/23, 12:43:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Always tell the benefits of being there and not saying "you can taste". Just "you will taste"
[10/27/23, 12:44:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok, now going to sleep
[10/27/23, 12:45:53 AM] Val Lapidus: As far as I know no tickets necessary
[10/27/23, 12:47:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is a wix thing. If it is paid or free they generate a ticket but there says it is free just right away, I added to the title. I will look again tomorrow how to drift this feature they have. They generate a ticket even if it is free.
[10/27/23, 12:48:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will go further tomorrow.
[10/27/23, 12:48:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thaaaaaaaanks Val
[10/27/23, 12:52:10 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 uploaded recordings from today’s session

[10/27/23, 12:55:45 AM] Val Lapidus: How many new followers did we get today?
[10/27/23, 1:00:26 AM] Val Lapidus: Our event was great everyone loved the hot chocolate and our CTA felt like it resonated.  I covered three major points in my convos:
1.  Cabruca farming
2. 36% vs 6%
3.  Blockchain to document supply chain

And closed with give us a follow on insta

We met a reporter Rachel Wolfson who reports on web 3 projects and hopefully we can nurture that relationship.
[10/27/23, 1:28:04 AM] Val Lapidus: Spent 1.5 hours just now. Cleaning up after our cacao making exercise
[10/27/23, 2:03:32 AM] Gary Teh: Me and @16468233438 spent 4 hours from 3pm to 7pm just now doing the event at Edge and Node 

*Time taken: 4 hours*
[10/27/23, 9:02:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: + 13

[10/27/23, 1:34:39 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm about to send this to designer for a menu mockup:  please provide feedback if you have some: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OT7Gn1k1GvPIpb4vUlC1CRtiygxvXpP6Nuznc2oSHsk/edit
[10/27/23, 1:53:57 PM] Emelin - Bahia: What designer are you hiring? I have a recommendation of someone from here.
[10/27/23, 1:54:36 PM] Val Lapidus: i have a personal friend that does all the work for me
[10/27/23, 1:54:59 PM] Val Lapidus: he is a contributor to the DAO
[10/27/23, 1:55:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok. In case he can't help, I have someone close to me as well.
[10/27/23, 1:55:16 PM] Val Lapidus: ty!
[10/27/23, 2:11:52 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps a profit share model with each event organizer.
[10/27/23, 2:12:23 PM] Val Lapidus: No profit share these types of events. Usually just have a flat fee
[10/27/23, 2:12:35 PM] Val Lapidus: We don't want to profit share profit. Sharing is a worst case scenario for us
[10/27/23, 2:20:55 PM] Anupa/diya: Can't we use psd  mockups
[10/27/23, 2:21:24 PM] Gary Teh: Whatever drives conversion and 💵💶💷💴💴💸🤑 🤩🙏

*Flat fee*
DAO bears the risk of both inventory and storefront 

*Profit share* 
risk shared between event organizer and DAO. 


*Profit share*
Seems more scalable since the only risk DAO bears is inventory risk which we are bearing at cost

Incentives are aligned

Otherwise event organizers organize a shitty event and DAO paid for shitty event ‎<This message was edited>
[10/27/23, 2:21:26 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what you're asking
[10/27/23, 2:21:37 PM] Val Lapidus: The designer will create a PSD mocca
[10/27/23, 2:21:42 PM] Val Lapidus: Mock up
[10/27/23, 2:24:18 PM] Anupa/diya: OR canva
[10/27/23, 2:24:35 PM] Anupa/diya: You get them free
[10/27/23, 2:24:40 PM] Anupa/diya: You just add the text
[10/27/23, 2:26:40 PM] Val Lapidus: We can figure out if an event is worthwhile by looking at it The risk you're describing I don't think is valid
‎[10/27/23, 2:29:53 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/27/23, 2:34:11 PM] Val Lapidus: We should be targeting events that have decent venues that guarantee a certain number of attendees. I think there are ways to mitigate this risk by doing research on the event seeing past event participation, talking to vendors who were at the event previously, things like that can certainly mitigate the risk
[10/27/23, 2:34:41 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s define an *event selection protocol* 🤩

This can then be adopted into DAO standard operating procedure and ease scaling later on

Especially for inexperienced members attempting the same in new cities ‎<This message was edited>

[10/28/23, 3:46:02 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 this question came up last night about cabruca method 

How do we ensure we do not overpopulate the undergrowth of the canopy with so much cacao trees it crowds out other species and decreases biodiversity?

Can you help provide answer?

I am sure this question will come up again when we present in crowd who are knowledgeable about environment and sustainability 

Thank you 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/28/23, 3:47:23 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 and @16468233438 please help check status of 100kg shipment on Monday

[10/29/23, 12:57:34 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: As it is a shade-tolerant plant, it grows well in understories and thin forests, making it an extremely conservationist crop for soil, fauna and flora. Little mechanized, it is a culture that provides a high degree of employment generation. It found in the south of Bahia one of the best soils and climate for its expansion.

The State of Bahia is the largest producer in Brazil, but its production capacity was reduced by up to 60% with the advent of witches' broom, caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, currently Moniliophthora perniciosa.

The cocoa production system in Bahia is known as cabruca, an agroforestry system, where the fruit is grown under trees in the Atlantic Forest, having great importance for the preservation of the forest.
[10/29/23, 12:59:34 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: What does "lead content" means?
[10/29/23, 1:04:41 AM] Val Lapidus: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead

Lead content is harmful to humans in large quantities and people often are concerned about lead within their food
[10/29/23, 1:07:12 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Oh! I see. I belive there isn't but I'll ask to be sure.

[10/30/23, 1:22:26 AM] Gary Teh: there's this huge ass report for decreasing lead & cadmium in cocoa:  https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59a706d4f5e2319b70240ef9/t/62fd592790137e31288a1698/1660770607858/AsYouSow_ChocolateFullReport_FIN_20220817.pdf
[10/30/23, 1:22:26 AM] Gary Teh: starting around page 149 it lists strategies to reduce lead in cocoa
[10/30/23, 1:22:34 AM] Gary Teh: From @16203326626
[10/30/23, 1:24:00 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002  could you check through the document that @16203326626 shared to see how we can further lower lead content within cacao nibs imported for future shipments 

Current level is still 10X of FDA recommendations
[10/30/23, 1:26:16 AM] Gary Teh: there's also this blog post that has a rough summary of that huge report:  https://www.asyousow.org/blog/2022/8/17/new-report-explains-simple-safe-and-low-cost-solutions-to-reduce-levels-of-lead-and-cadmium-in-chocolate
[10/30/23, 1:27:21 AM] Gary Teh: cocoa nibs that are sold above the fda threshold are required to put a proposition 65 sticker if it's being sold in california
[10/30/23, 1:27:59 AM] Val Lapidus: Ok hold on.  Do our competitors have this issue?
[10/30/23, 1:28:24 AM] Val Lapidus: Like is this cacao nibs from Brazil or all chocolate?
[10/30/23, 1:28:45 AM] Dean Mao: if you buy your competitors (like navitas) they have a proposition 65 sticker on their packaging
[10/30/23, 1:29:54 AM] Dean Mao: but I think some of their packaging does not have this sticker because some nibs that were grown in peru had less lead content and fell under the threshold where a sticker is needed
[10/30/23, 1:32:33 AM] Dean Mao: but yeah this is a big problem that only recently got lots of news coverage:  https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/a-third-of-chocolate-products-are-high-in-heavy-metals-a4844566398/
‎[10/30/23, 1:33:42 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/30/23, 1:33:47 AM] Dean Mao: lots of cocoa related products have a lead & cadmium problem.  The farmers growing the product aren't really that aware and don't have any mitigation strategies.  The big companies just buy the cocoa based on price
[10/30/23, 1:34:19 AM] Dean Mao: it's a known problem that only recently got coverage.  that huge pdf that gary posted was a study done in 2022
[10/30/23, 1:34:40 AM] Gary Teh: Tess did mentioned it earlier in the year
[10/30/23, 1:37:47 AM] Dean Mao: supposedly all of the lead comes from post-processing -- meaning the bean is lead free when it's pulled from the tree.
‎[10/30/23, 1:52:17 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/30/23, 2:06:38 AM] Val Lapidus: Someone help me understand.  Are the levels in our nibs the same higher or lower than other companies?
[10/30/23, 2:08:28 AM] Dean Mao: the lead is 500 ppb, cadmium 300 ppb
‎[10/30/23, 2:10:29 AM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/30/23, 2:11:13 AM] Dean Mao: but at least we are lower than indonesia or trinidad
‎[10/30/23, 2:12:04 AM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/30/23, 2:12:30 AM] Dean Mao: but lead is easier to fix because it's a post processing mistake and not a soil problem
[10/30/23, 2:14:43 AM] Dean Mao: but also maybe get your sample sent to a lab with more detailed data, and maybe send several samples
[10/30/23, 2:16:17 AM] Dean Mao: can also send the samples to labs in the USA too, so to get a second opinion
[10/30/23, 2:16:38 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 could you help check which facility was this report generated for?

Was it for Mailan’s facility or someone else’s facility? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/23, 2:19:17 AM] Gary Teh: There are a few facilities in their network let’s wait for @557391090002 to respond 

He is probably asleep now
‎[10/30/23, 2:22:14 AM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/30/23, 2:25:19 AM] Gary Teh: Also the report was a sample copy sent by Orlantildes 

I doubt it’s for Mailan’s facility 

What I am aware is that there are three processing facilities for roasting, cracking and winnowing 

Each farmer has their own fermentation and drying facility 

There are more than 600 plus farmers in the network. 

Seems like a great use case for using blockchain to track the supply chain network 

That way when a report is issued and the lead and cadmium is above threshold we will know which facility in the network is faulty and needs rectification
[10/30/23, 2:53:31 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 

Also help check if the report was for the cacao blend generated from the four farms we are sourcing from or other farms that is part of the cooperative
[10/30/23, 2:54:40 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 if there have been prior reports generated for cacaos processed at Mailan’s facility could you share them too? 

The most recent three reports will help us with our auditing process
[10/30/23, 4:33:13 AM] Gary Teh: 30 minutes FaceTime with @5511982667030 yesterday evening 

*Topics discussed*
    - marketing channels prioritization 
    - product configuration overextension concerns

[10/30/23, 1:10:01 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 and @5511982667030 

We haven’t heard anything from @557391090002 regarding the *failed lead content level report* we received yesterday 

Would one of you want to ask Orlantildes directly for a proper report? 

I doubt anyone in California would want to buy food with *lead content level warning label stuck* on it package and feed it to their kids

Resolving this issue is *mission critical* you are on the *hot seat* right now
[10/30/23, 1:39:27 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: I'm talking to him right now
[10/30/23, 1:40:34 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect! Please get this resolved *ASAP* 🙂🙏
[10/30/23, 1:41:09 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 

@557191035605 is waiting for the details from you for the night market to update our website

[10/30/23, 2:10:33 PM] Gary Teh: I am thinking as part of our experiment we should factor in 3 hours of California minimal wage for two employees as we consider scaling this part of our *go to market* model  

The rest of it should go to DAO

If this model works, I don’t think you or me should be devoting time to operate this aspects of our go to market model on a recurring basis but hire some minimal wage workers to do so ‎<This message was edited>

[10/30/23, 2:53:47 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not even going to discuss why this is such a bad idea.  We will document and run a number of market days (more than 5 less than 10) and detail cost/profit, and bring the franchise element to it, at which point franchisers can manage it however they want.  but I'm not going to give 1.5K worth of equipment to a hobo and tell them to run it for us.

what are the disadvantages to using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product
ChatGPT
Using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product can raise ethical and practical concerns. Here are some of the disadvantages:

Exploitation: It can be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals for commercial gain. Homeless people may be desperate for money and may agree to participate in marketing campaigns under coercive or exploitative conditions.

Stigmatization: Involving homeless individuals in marketing and sales may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas associated with homelessness, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of this group.

Dignity and Privacy: It may compromise the dignity and privacy of homeless people. Marketing and sales activities often involve public exposure, which can infringe on their personal space and comfort.

Unintended Consequences: Using homeless people in marketing may draw negative attention or backlash, leading to unintended consequences for both the brand and the individuals involved.

Ethical Concerns: Ethical questions can arise about whether the compensation and support provided to homeless participants are fair and adequate. This includes concerns about fair wages, working conditions, and access to healthcare and social services.

Short-Term Solution: Using homeless individuals in marketing and sales does not address the root causes of homelessness, which are primarily related to housing, employment, mental health, and social safety nets. It may be seen as a short-term, superficial solution to a complex social issue.

Dependence on Exploitation: Relying on homeless people for marketing and sales may perpetuate a system where vulnerable individuals become dependent on such opportunities instead of receiving appropriate support and assistance.

Risk to Brand Reputation: Associating a brand with the use of homeless people in marketing can lead to backlash, harm brand reputation, and result in boycotts or negative public sentiment.

Legal and Regulatory Concerns: There may be legal and regulatory challenges, such as ensuring that all participants are adults who have provided informed consent. Employing homeless individuals without addressing labor and employment laws could lead to legal issues.

Lack of Expertise: Homeless individuals may not have the necessary expertise or training for marketing and sales roles, potentially affecting the effectiveness of the campaign and customer experience.

It is important for businesses and organizations to consider these disadvantages carefully and explore alternative ways to support homeless individuals that are more ethical and sustainable. These may include partnering with charities and organizations, providing job training and housing assistance, or actively participating in efforts to address homelessness in their communities.
[10/30/23, 2:58:51 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 that's not to say I am against hiring of homeless.  On the contrary, I'd be happy to hire them for package and back of house activities, and am happy to pay them more than minimum wage.
[10/30/23, 2:59:53 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you use homeless in your marketing/sales you will jeopardize our brand and our marketing efforts for franchising
[10/30/23, 3:01:07 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you are going to conduct experiments with homeless in sales/marketing than please do so using a different brand other than Agroverse, and only once the efforts are deemed successful you can attempt your experiments on Agroverse.
[10/30/23, 3:01:35 PM] Gary Teh: Dan runs a social program that is rehabilitating the homeless. Those are looking for jobs.

Those folks in the photos are not homeless they are peddlers
[10/30/23, 3:06:53 PM] Gary Teh: technically they are no longer homeless as they are being housed by Dan's facility right now
[10/30/23, 3:10:37 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If there is a facility there are some data about why these guys ended up on the streets and if they have been clear on anything they used (if they used), right?
[10/30/23, 3:10:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: *joins the discussion because it seems interesting*
[10/30/23, 3:11:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Many uber drivers in Brazil have a graduation. I've met lawyers, teachers, accountants, but when things got hard here, they had to find a way out.
[10/30/23, 3:12:34 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We don't have financial education at schools so facing a hard time with no one to help, it is easy to loose everything.
[10/30/23, 3:13:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Val seems reasonable, Gary as well. These people may have a gap on their job because of the time they were without a job.
[10/30/23, 3:13:55 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Two people seems just a few, but you might compromise with something bigger than you guys think.
[10/30/23, 3:14:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So it is smart to join the will of helping others with a strategy that protects Agroverse.
[10/30/23, 3:14:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: maybe start with one person and see how it goes.
[10/30/23, 3:15:11 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Second person you guys would have more experience about what can go sideways and yet, would not put that much of time, something you don't have right now.
[10/30/23, 3:15:25 PM] Emelin - Bahia: *leaves the room shaking hands*
[10/30/23, 4:57:36 PM] Val Lapidus: @557391090002 is there any way for us to pay Orlantildes where in we don't have a huge taxation event?
[10/30/23, 4:58:52 PM] Val Lapidus: it seems like the cost of doing business with Brazil has high amounts of taxes and we need to find away to mitigate these costs.
[10/30/23, 5:03:43 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Orlantildes said that he will ask the company who provide the information about the lead to confirm the data we have
[10/30/23, 5:40:27 PM] Gary Teh: Spent time with @16468233438 just now loaded our inventory into the warehouse in proper

*Time taken: 3 hours*
[10/30/23, 6:02:16 PM] Val Lapidus: just spoke to Kevin he mentioned a chocolate shop in Wauwatosa WI that makes high end chocolate and I called them to see if they would be interested in sampling. I spoke to Dan the owner, we need to get them a sample of #9: 
7515 Harwood Ave.
Wauwatosa, WI 53213
and we need to get them an email of some questions.
@557391090002 for the blend that we are doing, how did we decide on those four farms.  Are we able to source from a single farm?  Do you have a website for the Cacao institute that will be doing the testing of our nibs?  
Also can you give me all the details regarding the roasting/fermentation process for this blend we are getting?

[10/31/23, 12:22:39 AM] Gary Teh: What is a nickname you would give the profile?
[10/31/23, 12:23:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Environmental ethical trackers 🤣

[10/31/23, 12:44:32 AM] Gary Teh: … as a group… should be as decentralized and autonomous as possible 🤣

Don’t try to centralize things too much when there is no critical need for that

Otherwise it stops being DAO ‎<This message was edited>
[10/31/23, 12:48:57 AM] Anupa/diya: How is we as a collective being centralized. For the people by the people
[10/31/23, 12:50:16 AM] Gary Teh: For example @5511982667030 has her ideas about how the products should just be about cacao nibs 

Since @16468233438 is doing the execution it’s his call how he wants to modify the products to become drinks instead 

While @16468233438 was busy I was messing around with the recipe. Since it was my execution, while @16468233438  has his opinion, since I was doing the execution, I did it my way 

I know Annia designed the T-Shirt but since @16468233438was placing the order with the printer he could decide which design he wants

But since I was paying for the shirts when I picked them up, it was my call to buy another t-shirt for the homeless whom I wanted to run a social experiment on 

All these diversity is by design ‎<This message was edited>

[10/31/23, 11:50:03 PM] Gary Teh: Attendee of one of the events we sponsored
[11/1/23, 2:33:17 AM] Gary Teh: When I was at the Crypto Rockstar conference in Germany earlier in the year, I had the opportunity to speak to the company that Jakob hired to help line up the sponsors for him to close.

It sees there is one person in charge of building the database and another in charge of warming the lead to get to an appointment before Jakob comes in to close the sponsorship deal

It feels like a human supply chain ‎<This message was edited>
[11/1/23, 7:04:17 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Good morning guys! A had a conversation with Orlantildes yesterday night. I belive we had a misunderstanding here.  When u guys asked me about the lead on the Cocoa and I talked to Orlantildes about it he didn't notice that I was referring to your Nibs. He thought that it was about a general research that's why he sent me a test made by OFI relative a Cocoa that pass through a industrial method and it  and not a test made by CIC directed to our nibs. Nibs as u know it's about the bean dry toasted and broken and nothing more.

So some scope needs to be unloaded. Perhaps *business development* activities since you are trying to straddle both *business development* and *operations* 

interfacing with Christino falls under *business development* scope 🙂🙏

Interfacing with Orlantildes right now falls under *operations scope* ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/23, 7:55:37 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 The next model I'd like to experiment on is one that involves direct sale to chocolate makers
[11/2/23, 7:56:53 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! Give this current model you are working on a few more iterations. If it works great! We start populating people with it and scale it. If it does not, we drop it.

Let me know what are the different steps you have in mind for this new model that self compounds. Let's update our growth engine ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/23, 10:04:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Our call to action at farmers markets in California should be an outright attack on Nestle
[11/2/23, 10:05:27 PM] Val Lapidus: Something along the lines of :  help end nestlé drink Amazonian rainforest chocolate
[11/2/23, 10:05:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Or let's rid the world of Nestle
[11/2/23, 10:25:51 PM] Gary Teh: Test that CTA at the next event 

Can you try to shorten it to less than 7 worlds
[11/2/23, 10:26:44 PM] Val Lapidus: F uck nestle

[11/3/23, 4:57:38 AM] Anupa/diya: I thought this was fantastic! Building product fit with storytelling @31641075825 check this out. 

The girl basically created a buzz about the context and how it's used and then launched her own product.
[11/3/23, 4:58:05 AM] Anupa/diya: It might be a great way to adopt for social media and other marketing tactics
[11/3/23, 10:00:43 AM] Gary Teh: Just received invoice from Coopercabruca for the USDA NOP cacao nibs 

https://portal.omie.com.br/view/2023-11-03/f58c1bf369f3928a577c991e8521a571acfae030?a=6ezzn0f&d=0bf5av1btgqcz&t=r
[11/3/23, 10:03:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: according to my knowledge that instagram algo differentiates between high-quality posts (specifically the ones that promote sales) and personal.

Your mini-documentary is good for attracting viral audience to build up the community around the philosophy/concept . but we would be very lucky if we can hit 2 birds one stone aka also a concept soldiier and a buyer/client
[11/3/23, 10:04:20 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you need to follow up with Orlantildes to get any reference number that Omega services might have issued Coopercabruca for the cacao shipment that is being sent to them in Salvador 

That way, when you reach out to Omega services and attempt to follow up with our cargo to understand the arrangements they have setup with SeaCoastLogistics they will know what we are talking about 

You can get @5511982667030 to support you if you need. Feel free to exercise your autonomy. Critical point is make sure this shipment does not fall through the crack anywhere in the interfacing and disappear 

*Omega services*: outbound freighting company based in Salvador 

*SeaCoast Logistic*: customs broker based in USA

PS: I am making a huge assumption that there is in fact a reference number here. Perhaps there is none. That is for you to go figure out ‎<This message was edited>
[11/3/23, 10:04:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: yees indeed and what gary is producing is kind of similar iin aanother format
[11/3/23, 10:07:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: i can’t advance the instagram under “corporate sales” push before it gets surrounded by the community concept/

as corporate sales can easily eliminate the community aspect thus showing us as just “bllablaer’s” and utilizing social as a pretext to just sell a product 🤷
[11/3/23, 10:07:43 AM] Gary Teh: We are using Instagram to sell products
[11/3/23, 10:08:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes but we are imitating this strategy… from ur personal story content we are infusing the product to sell .
[11/3/23, 10:08:52 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 go study how this Iran dude I met last night does it 

https://instagram.com/itsyouofficial?igshid=NGVhN2U2NjQ0Yg==

His clothes are selling like hot cakes
[11/3/23, 10:09:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: we focus on stories and in beetween throw product promotiion
[11/3/23, 10:11:39 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to exercise your autonomy 

What is a good KPI (key performance index) you would like to benchmark your personal experiments against? 

Otherwise no measurements no improvements ‎<This message was edited>
[11/3/23, 10:12:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: ok quiick anallysis of what u sent:

- instagram page with fiirst post 21/02/2020 = beginning of building his instagram community

- a pure product sales page = very clear set of target client and simple  call to actiion “ come buy”
VS our caase

we are telling all stories about farmers and sustainability and change and innovation and and and then oh  please buy to support thee mission
[11/3/23, 10:14:55 AM] Gary Teh: 21/02/2020 was two years ago
[11/3/23, 10:17:09 AM] Suheil - Europe: exactly my point that iit took him that long to reach 3k which obviously they did organic and surrounded the right audience . 

As a designer you are heavily active offline which then get translated into “instagram” . I would be pretty astonished if designer tells me “ ii succeeded to generate my online ssales oonly from instagram”
[11/3/23, 10:18:24 AM] Suheil - Europe: fashion and clothing iindustry is annia’s expertise. in fact, what made anniia loose her mind with us is that she iis not understanding why we are focusing on community and not just setting up a traditional business page 🤷 
her reaction was liitteraly like : “ i dont understand what you guyz are doiing filming yourself for an instagram page to sell cacao “ hhhh
[11/3/23, 10:20:46 AM] Suheil - Europe: i understand her as she is in pure business mode of how she got used to work and buiild up online shops
[11/3/23, 10:21:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: i cant put KPI’s on building a community 
I can put KPI’s in business language and it will require budgets because i never saw in my life a business succeeding to push onliine sales under a business mode without setting up a long term execution budget for online marketing (like even if its only 100$ /month budget for 12 months doesnt matteer whats the amount but the algo needs money to push sales prooduct

[11/3/23, 2:50:34 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes just send me the address and how much they ordered

[11/3/23, 2:54:44 PM] Suheil - Europe: Wt u mean Amazon details for tracking ?

[11/3/23, 5:14:16 PM] Val Lapidus: on our website: Become a part of the Agroverse community, a network of conscious consumers and advocates for sustainable living.

it should be: conscientious
[11/3/23, 5:14:21 PM] Val Lapidus: can someone please fix this
[11/3/23, 5:15:03 PM] Val Lapidus: These two words look similar, but they are not interchangeable. You should use conscientious in terms of desire and performing deliberate actions and conscious in terms of physically being awake or simply aware of something.
[11/3/23, 5:16:27 PM] Val Lapidus: also on our website what is: 8 THE GRN STE A

[11/4/23, 2:45:56 PM] Anupa/diya: It got me thinking.... if you guys want... at your events... maybe along with the tasting.. you might want a virtual vr space to experience with cacao making.

I could set something up on spatial.
[11/4/23, 2:46:16 PM] Gary Teh: That would be quite cool! How would that work??
[11/4/23, 2:46:43 PM] Anupa/diya: Given your costing now. Let's do a prototype
[11/4/23, 2:47:15 PM] Gary Teh: Is it a website or needs a VR headset?
[11/4/23, 2:47:39 PM] Anupa/diya: I can use spatial to build a story telling and you guys can get an oculus on rent for people to experience the spatial
[11/4/23, 2:47:45 PM] Anupa/diya: Spatial is like a free metaverse
[11/4/23, 2:48:00 PM] Anupa/diya: You can use the laptop or you can use vr to access it
[11/4/23, 2:48:16 PM] Anupa/diya: We can add all the videos and footage
[11/4/23, 2:48:25 PM] Anupa/diya: Photos and set up a gallery
[11/4/23, 2:48:58 PM] Anupa/diya: You guys can play that on site while having the events with vr
[11/4/23, 2:49:14 PM] Gary Teh: That would be quite an interesting concept and aligns well with our theme of *Saving our Rainforest with Web3*
[11/4/23, 2:50:33 PM] Anupa/diya: If you guys can get a vr.. let's do it. I know last year it was huge at the web 3 events.
[11/4/23, 2:50:38 PM] Anupa/diya: And it's fun.
[11/4/23, 2:50:55 PM] Anupa/diya: Gets people curious ! At live events

[11/4/23, 3:41:26 PM] Anupa/diya: Ya ..that's what i do. If it's on a MacBook, it's not that great for an in person. Doable

We could do a product launch event. have people on spatial .
[11/4/23, 3:44:33 PM] Gary Teh: Sounds fun. Exercise your *Autonomy* and go for it! 

Always great to have some *Diversity* in the experience we offer to folks in the community

That way I can compile the performance information and have it shared in the Townhall with the rest of the governance tokens holders 

This will help serve as the baseline benchmark for our next iteration

[11/5/23, 3:00:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I spotted a few people have the same issue but there is a lock on the comments. I have added one for us . I dont think we should shut amazon because the end to end delivery service is full proof.
[11/5/23, 3:47:18 AM] Gary Teh: Would you like to follow up and deal with the issue now that you have access to Amazon sellers account as well

@16468233438 until now has not logged into the Amazon account yet

The only folks who have done so thus far are you (@918017107841 ), myself and @31641075825 

I am thinking since @31641075825 and Annia are working on Instagram, perhaps you should oversee Amazon

That way @557191035605 can oversee Wix

Which leaves @16468233438 to just focus on the farmer's market, events sponsorship and fulfilment stuff

I am streamlining the load on @16468233438 plate now as I did yours last month ‎<This message was edited>

[11/5/23, 5:46:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I have no idea about sales ! I am service design😆 do we have any sales and marketing ?

[11/6/23, 5:28:55 PM] Val Lapidus: When we go to events or talk about our product. There are three key talking points, none of those talking points are on the website, and they are the most interesting aspect of this project.  I'd like to work on getting those points into the main site.  The three talking points are:

6% versus 36% to farmers
Cabruca farming method
Supply chain on the blockchain

[11/6/23, 6:53:24 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 ☝️does this mean that the DAO doesn’t want to participate in the farmers market?
[11/6/23, 6:54:49 PM] Gary Teh: If it’s selling hot choclate, you are correct

the bulk of the consensus is the guild just wants to stick to nibs 

Any processing beyond the nibs stage, it is independent of the dao 

The exception would be it is a product that was created in its final form on the farmer’s end and past through DAO network for distribution in USA

The model becomes cleaner in this regard

Rather than becoming a manufacturer we stick to being a distributor 

Otherwise a lot of the value captured along the supply chain needs to stay with us to pay for all these transformation expenses instead of passing directly to the farmers and the cooperatives where they should be ‎<This message was edited>
‎[11/6/23, 7:07:08 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[11/6/23, 7:12:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Cabruca farming method is explained in the shop, after realizing it is also an important place to have it, as some will go straight to see the product. The idea was to create a page with cabruca method explained again in case of more curious users to be inclined to search for a about us as a page itself
[11/6/23, 7:13:10 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We got some content removed after talking with Gary
[11/6/23, 7:13:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: On the whitepaper
[11/6/23, 7:13:29 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So we need to see what comes in.
[11/6/23, 7:14:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: You can highlight on whitepaper itself and I can work on it on saturday.
[11/6/23, 7:48:37 PM] Gary Teh: Also an insight that became apparent about our DAO after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

I feel we should play to our strengths instead of our weakness

From this perspective, manufacturing is not going to be our strength. Instead distribution is. 

We are not leveraging enough of our strength in distribution and kind of got alittl distracted in the manufacturing side of things ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/23, 8:58:19 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't necessarily agree with any of that.  But at the same time the only difference for me is that I can no longer tokenize the elements required to execute on the path that I'm currently on. I have full autonomy to execute whatever I want to. But now the guild will simply not share in the profit. If I happen to generate one instead, they will only see the benefit of me purchasing the nibs and potentially me reselling the nibs ‎<This message was edited>

[11/7/23, 12:15:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I think the events is a great idea. The retail bussiness is huge and it is a great source for marketing. However There is a huge initial expense involved and more than that it is a lot of work. 

In India there is a huge percentage of small to large  scale entrepreneurs who just sell via markets bazaars to large expos. They extremely well during the holiday seasons. I had seen in London, during the Christmas markets, mulled wine and hot chocolate were high selling drinks 

The Charlie and chocolate factory is releasing maybe some sort of buzz can happen around the Golden ticket 

@16468233438 you can create your own brand called Val's chocolate drink. That can be sub brand for agroverse
[11/7/23, 12:47:10 AM] Anupa/diya: *ATTENTION* I am creating a team section on the tru sight for agroverse. Please dm me your name, any photo that shows this is you and your role

[11/7/23, 12:52:58 AM] Anupa/diya: @557191035605 do you know where all the event videos and photos are
[11/7/23, 3:00:55 AM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps even an independent brand
[11/7/23, 3:01:12 AM] Gary Teh: There is no such group
[11/7/23, 3:10:22 AM] Gary Teh: When I think of a DAO and I think of a highly structured labor intensive operation, I just don’t see how these two models can resolve and if it does how. does it sustain itself. House of Balance has been trying to utilize this model to hold large scale events every year. The model doesn’t really facilitate that

When I think even more deeply of the organic behavior exhibited by DAO members over the past two years, I feel  it more readily lends itself to such kind of casual informal impromptu structures

[11/10/23, 2:56:02 PM] Gary Teh: Back last year during the prediction market project, I have already setup the initial working prototype type for our own EVM based chain 

The code can be found here 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

Didn’t bother to do any further development as that was not the critical action

The critical action was Discovering and Validating a *viable business case* for TrueSight DAO

But as a bootstrap we can have the entries notarized on Ethereum or one of the EVM compatible chains work

At some point it makes sense is to have our own chain and miners as opposed to constantly paying another tech company gas/transaction fees. 

That was what lead to the thinking of *Sunmint* off the grid data center clusters where Our miners will be housed there. 

When I was in Bahia Matheus and Marcel offered their place to run miners. 

Hence it might not even be necessary for us to own the land where SunMint operates on. We run the nodes on the property of the farmers and the gas/transaction fees are paid to them

I went short and straight with the content here. Val and I talked that before putting any information is important to know which information is gonna enter and along with what.

[11/10/23, 4:27:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: What I recommended to Val as we talked today was to be sure what he wants on the site, so a new page can be created and all this info can be together. I mention it there, but if you guys want a deeper explanation on this I need to create a page and in order to create this, all info need to be put together first.
[11/10/23, 4:27:48 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is the kind of info on "how it is prepared" and it deserves an "about us" section not directed to the homepage, same process as scrolling down, but to another section.
[11/10/23, 4:28:04 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Gather the info, decide, let me read them, group them, and then, I add to the site. :)

_Step 2: will get @557191035605 help with brochure design that utilizes the native artwork that she created in our brand guide_

_Step 3: once packaging of the 100KG incoming import is completed and I am done with my 3 week retreat, print the brochures and hit the stores and the manufacturers along the entire west coast of USA_

_PS: @⁨Val Lapidus⁩ perhaps leave some portions of the 100KG unpackaged as my sense is some manufacturer might just want to buy in bulk_ ‎<This message was edited>
[11/11/23, 5:05:28 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 thoughts on 16th arrangement?

*Option 1: 2 pronged operations*

Based on the inputs from Orlantildes, it seems having just one person at the airport will be more than sufficient to load the 100KG on to a rented uhaul van (approximately USD41)

That way you don’t need to be rushing over to the airport and then back to deal with preparing and making available the chocolate drinks for Edge and Node anniversary event

*Option 2: delay the pickup*

Have SeaCoast Logistics pick up the cargo from the airport and then we pick it up after the event. I am sure they will be charging something for that service. Not sure if it is going to be more expensive than USD41. Also judging by the dimensions of each box, I might need to get another transport before I could load the boxes in my car anyways. 

*Follow up*
Let me know your preference by Monday. So that I have enough lead time to arrange for logistics with U-haul services. 🤩

[11/12/23, 2:49:46 PM] Gary Teh: *Question 1*
Are you sure it’s exactly 24 hours and not before clock strikes midnight of crossing from 16th to 17th of Nov?

There are some ambiguities there that needs clarification 

*Question 2*
Also SFO is a very large place. 

Which exact terminal or gate should we be heading to to pick up our cargo or are we even supposed going to be heading to the passenger terminals at all? 
Perhaps there is a specific facility we are supposed to report to to claim our cargo when we arrive for the pickup 

*Proposed follow up*
These are two questions you should want to clarify with Graziela on Monday when she is in the office. 

Let me know if you want to do the follow up instead. I only have very little lead time (Tuesday and Wednesday) to respond if _questions 1 and 2_ requires specific arrangements to be made. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

If The vendor who wants to use him to create the product for sales at various events then the vendor 

If we want to use him to handle packaging of DAO cacao nibs then the DAO will pay.
[11/13/23, 4:14:29 PM] Val Lapidus: who is managing him?
[11/13/23, 4:15:02 PM] Gary Teh: *Management*

If the vendor wants to use him to generate product for sales at events. Then the vendor

If the DAO wants to use him for packaging then someone from the DAO getting paid 100TDG per hour

[11/13/23, 4:16:49 PM] Val Lapidus: so as a vendor, i wouldn’t put him for sales at events, he’s a cook not a seller, so that doesn’t make sense.  as for if the DAO is using him.  So now instead of a DAO member working and producing at 100 TDG per hour, we are now increasing the cost.  It doesn’t make sense
[11/13/23, 4:19:01 PM] Gary Teh: He is a cook suitable for the kitchen

He is not suitable for sales 

Vendor has autonomy to do what vendor wants to. 

Just think of vendor as a separate company

DAO does not control how vendor handles things internally. 

And neither can DAO control how individual DAO member executes on things 

The only thing that DAO does is surface what can be proposed to DAO members. 

It is up to individual members to decide if he/she wants to invest personal time/resource/money in what is being proposed by DAO ‎<This message was edited>

[11/15/23, 4:50:57 PM] Val Lapidus: we may need after we are done packaging to deliver it to my house
[11/15/23, 4:58:34 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. Worst case scenario if we can’t do it all in one shot at least someone to stand guard over our cargo while the rest are doing the transporting 🤣

My assumption is once we unload the cargo from the warehouse the airport staff don’t want us going in an out anymore

[11/15/23, 8:11:29 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 why are you reaching out to Coopercabruca for a 3KG shipment?  why can’t this be shipped out of the 100KG we already have?
[11/15/23, 8:12:14 PM] Gary Teh: Cost price is too expensive.
[11/15/23, 8:12:14 PM] Val Lapidus: This is not a good use of resources
[11/15/23, 8:12:42 PM] Gary Teh: We need to know what the end to end cost is for direct shipping to Switzerland

Before I left Brazil, I left one of my credit cards with @5511982667030 

If required in the future, @5511982667030 can withdraw money from that card and then transfer it to Coopercabruca via Pix
[11/17/23, 1:14:49 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 Seems our cacao nibs got cleared by the customs? 🤩

[11/17/23, 11:34:28 PM] Gary Teh: *Spent 30 minutes* FaceTime with @5511982667030 clearing up the confusion

@5511982667030 has my Wells Fargo credit card 

@5511982667030 also has R$500 under her management 

For expected payments these three weeks, She can pay from the R$500 under management

If expenses goes beyond R$500 that she has with her right now, she can withdraw money using my credit card at one of their local banks’ ATM 

This way is much cheaper to pay for smaller amounts of expenses incurred in Brazil (less than USD1000) than paying via International Wire transfer

*This is just an interim solution*

I am not expecting any large payments to Brazil side till end of the year. 

If need does arise that we pay for items above USD1000 before year end, it is recommended we do wireless transfer via USA bank 

In the future, beyond the end of this year, if our sales and marketing efforts in USA and Europe is successful and we believe there is a foreseeable need to make constant payments to Brazil suppliers, I will personally fly into Brazil and setup for a dedicated digital bank account and hook it up with PIX.

that way we can make future payments to suppliers in Brazil directly via PIX. Via this route we will not have to incur international bank transfer cost ‎<This message was edited>

As discussed and agreed upon, inviting you out of our guild 

@16468233438 will be the primary interface between Brazil and USA moving forward

[11/22/23, 8:25:42 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 This is the mailer I used 

https://www.dollartree.com/peel-seal-kraft-paper-envelopes-5-ct/361746



*_Key constrains*_
When combined with shipping labels from stamps.com, total shipping and material cost will be under *_USD6.50*_ which is what we are currently charging for shipping within USA. 

To stay under this cost each package shipped out must be under *_9 ounce*_ to stick to that shipping price 

Also packaging and mailer materials *must not contain plastic* otherwise our brand story of saving the rainforest totally falls apart, which means we will need to totally scrape the story that we are saving the rainforest and tell a totally different brand story for Agroverse. Right now I don’t even know what other compelling story to tell other than this one. 



*Worst case scenario analysis*
if our brand story doesn’t work and nothing sells, we will just donate our entire inventory to GoodWill during *Christmas 2024* and scrape the project. Since expiry date is within a year, we can’t sell it beyond *17th 2024* 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

[11/24/23, 5:55:33 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Thanks @31641075825, its a great start to grasp the generalities, we need more information about the actual product and the cabruca method, our collaboration with the cooperative and a slide on truesight. We need to showcase the social and env impact while exhibiting our product: characteristics, packaging, etc…
[11/24/23, 10:37:48 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=241235

Write up by US government on the cabruca system and challenge farmers face due to low income/hectare.

increasing number of these land turning into pasture land (or chop down trees and grow soy beans) when farmers give up thereby adding to global warming ‎<This message was edited>
[11/24/23, 10:38:40 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.truesight.me/agroverse

There is the link to the white paper on this page which talks about how our model aims to help the farmers using the cabruca method

This is achieved through reconfiguration of supply chain so they get paid 34% instead of the original 6% from the revenue proceeds of choclate sale ‎<This message was edited>

[11/28/23, 5:36:13 PM] Gary Teh: Seems this _article_ as well as our _bag of cacao nibs_ sitting at the kitchen counter came in really handy for storytelling purposes 

Today is the off day for the entire community at the zen center

Randomly bumped into the manager in charge of procuring all the food supplies for the zen kitchen

She gave me an in-depth dive of the _user psychology_ when it comes to stocking their kitchen and how their supply chain works.

She loved the *_story of saving the rainforest*_  as well as the *_earthy design of the package*_ so much, she has offered to help setup an appointment with the *_procurement manager*_ of their Whole Foods supplier. Once we establish a relationship with the _*procurement manager_*, the hope is that they will start buying our cacao nibs in bulk

Also she has offered to drive me over to meet the _*procurement manager*_ once the Whole Foods retailer responses

She also mentioned that the zen center is geographically situated right at the heart of where our target demographic is located 

The universe is very visibly self aligning. 🤩🙏

https://veritablevegetable.com/grower/

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

[11/29/23, 5:27:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Who is monitoring the queue of Amazon for items ordered?
[11/29/23, 9:42:21 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has volunteered for that
[11/29/23, 9:43:35 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 what orders have there been?
[11/29/23, 9:44:15 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 did you know that we have to mark orders as shipped on Amazon? I got an email from Amazon for the item that I purchased that because it hasn't been shipped. My credit card wasn't charged
[11/30/23, 1:00:51 AM] Anupa/diya: Hi Val
[11/30/23, 1:01:13 AM] Anupa/diya: I had no idea that things had to be marked.
[11/30/23, 1:02:07 AM] Anupa/diya: I am not looking into orders anymore. I was looking into the Amazon issue which I believe is solved. I have way too much on my plate now to look into sales.
‎[11/30/23, 1:02:28 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎image omitted
[11/30/23, 2:08:47 AM] Gary Teh: Thanks for clarifying this. It is good to know no one is actively monitoring it. 🙂🙏
[11/30/23, 2:16:24 AM] Anupa/diya: I was under the impression that I had to the Amazon thing and I have started with spatial for agroverse so that's going to take up my time
[11/30/23, 2:23:17 AM] Gary Teh: What are you actively working on now within the scope of Agroverse? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/30/23, 2:24:00 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 what are you actively working on now within the scope of Agroverse? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/30/23, 2:25:00 AM] Gary Teh: Rodney is starting to become active within this scope.

We should free up room here in this guild for him 

One person needs to leave 🙂🙏
[11/30/23, 2:25:46 AM] Gary Teh: I am pretty happy to step away from this guild if no one offers to free up the space
[11/30/23, 3:23:14 AM] Anupa/diya: The spatial thing. The details are somewhere if one scrolls up
[11/30/23, 3:23:23 AM] Anupa/diya: And some up buyer leads
[11/30/23, 5:18:24 AM] Val Lapidus: What are the credentials for Amazon?  Where do I find the orders that were placed once I login?

[11/30/23, 9:31:25 AM] Gary Teh: You will need a one time password to login to the account that is sent to my phone when you attempt to login for the first time 

Once Amazon recognizes your computer they will stop asking it
[11/30/23, 9:31:43 AM] Gary Teh: Not sure. Check YouTube for tutorial once you login
[11/30/23, 10:13:01 AM] Anupa/diya: My work is subsidiary. I just need to be in contact with someone from agroverse to give updates from buyer leads and spatial.. my work is not daily or operational. So I can leave
[11/30/23, 10:13:36 AM] Anupa/diya: Since Rodney is more active than me. I can just pass on the details
[11/30/23, 12:53:37 PM] Rodney Wieck: ‎You added Rodney Wieck
[11/30/23, 12:55:53 PM] Gary Teh: Please welcome @19209806391 to our guild 

@19209806391’s primary role now within our guild will be to help introduce our cacao nibs to merchants in his geographical area (_Wisconsin area, USA_)

later on when we have a supply chain established to his region, oversee the warehousing facility that he right now operates

He also has warehousing facilities in Montana area 🙂🙏
[11/30/23, 12:57:32 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 thank you once again for your active contribution to our guild during this tenure 

Looking forward to your contribution again in the very near future. Inviting you out for now 

I expect I will be in India sometime next year. Let’s sync up in @120363041505997891@g.us on which Tradeshows in India to visit while I am there 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/30/23, 2:03:14 PM] Gary Teh: Please work closely with @16468233438 and @12245781775 

@16468233438 is based in San Francisco and where our main warehousing is and does sales outreach 

@12245781775 is based in Chicago. He mainly does cold calls
[12/1/23, 7:59:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: sorry for delay answer, i will get my focus back to here by early next week and will follow up with everything going here
[12/1/23, 10:26:02 AM] Vlatko Gigov: hey Team. hope all is well. I have received the nibs already and have a meeting on Monday. we need to have this presentation ready by then.
[12/1/23, 10:28:14 AM] Vlatko Gigov: the focus on the presentation needs to be on the 1. product, 2. sustainability efforts, 3. supply chain tracking, 3. the farming / organic methodology, 4. production process
[12/1/23, 10:29:00 AM] Vlatko Gigov: we need to stress what are the differentiating factors from other nibs producers.
[12/1/23, 10:46:11 AM] Suheil - Europe: I will do my best to assign couple of hours during the week end to finish it . Can't promise though 😕

[12/1/23, 12:38:33 PM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 in thought Gary sent you a pack with packaging and nibs?  If you need more.  Please tell me how many packs you need, and how much nibs you need
[12/1/23, 1:02:46 PM] Vlatko Gigov: heya Val, i’ve received only 3kg directly from Brazil. I dont have the actual agroverse product. and thats what I need.
[12/1/23, 1:03:18 PM] Vlatko Gigov: i need only the packaging with labels to then fill them in with what I have.
[12/1/23, 1:05:52 PM] Gary Teh: I was going to pass @41799155602 the packaging when I arrive in Switzerland 

But if he is able to get it before I arrive then less weigh in my backpack 🙂🙏
[12/1/23, 1:08:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: yeah that was the initial plan, but the nibs (christmas) has arrived early.
[12/1/23, 1:21:13 PM] Val Lapidus: How many packs do you need?  When do you need them?  Address?
‎[12/1/23, 8:54:55 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[12/1/23, 9:02:38 PM] Gary Teh: Which by service provider and package did you use for @41799155602?

There is one that just cost USD21 for worldwide for each 8 ounce bag 

Please use that one next time
[12/1/23, 9:03:54 PM] Gary Teh: Also which one did you use for @19209806391 

USPS provider should be charging maximum USd6.50 for each 8 ounce bag
[12/1/23, 9:04:26 PM] Val Lapidus: It turns out that both packages were supposed to go via UPS instead of USPS.  So I'm going to go home and figure out if there is a $21 option and canceled this 100 option
[12/1/23, 9:04:46 PM] Gary Teh: Yes please.
[12/1/23, 9:05:01 PM] Val Lapidus: Can you send me a screenshot of the configuration that you chose to get a $21 shipment

Why was it USd10.xx? ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/23, 9:09:38 PM] Val Lapidus: rodney was 18 oz

[12/1/23, 9:09:51 PM] Val Lapidus: ten dollars

[12/1/23, 9:12:49 PM] Gary Teh: If process is becoming too much of a load please let us know.

We will make modifications to the process to reduce load on your side

[12/1/23, 9:15:27 PM] Val Lapidus: the only thing different is I selected pritn on: and chose 8.5x11 paper
[12/1/23, 9:17:23 PM] Val Lapidus: ok, for some reason it didn’t give me the option to select USPS as a carrier when i tried originaly
[12/1/23, 9:18:48 PM] Val Lapidus: deleted message as it had vladko’s personal address
[12/1/23, 9:23:41 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 i’ve requested refunds for both items and am redoing the lables
[12/2/23, 1:43:09 AM] Gary Teh: What were the contents shipped to Vlatko? 

That way I can gauge what else to bring him when I arrive in Switzerland 

Also know how to update *_ledger for AGL2*_
[12/2/23, 1:43:46 AM] Val Lapidus: 8 empty 8oz labeled packs
[12/2/23, 1:47:11 AM] Gary Teh: @41799155602

Are you planning to sell these 8 bags or giving out as samples to prospective distributors?

If distributing them out to prospective distributors, then cost of cacao nibs and freighting should be deducted from *_OffChain ledger and borne by DAO*_

If planning to sell to buyers than the total cost and DAO based standard markup will be charged via *_invoice issued*_

Let me know which is which ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 1:47:36 AM] Val Lapidus: He said he was going to go show the packaging to the potential buyers. He's not selling it
[12/2/23, 2:00:51 AM] Gary Teh: Ok. Charge to DAO off chain balance
[12/2/23, 2:01:11 AM] Gary Teh: What did @19209806391 mentioned he would use the 18 ounces of cacao nibs for?
[12/2/23, 3:34:50 AM] Val Lapidus: He is bringing it as samples to sales meetings
[12/2/23, 9:27:58 AM] Gary Teh: Ok charge to DAO off chain balance then 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 11:33:13 AM] Vlatko Gigov: correct.
[12/2/23, 11:34:12 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 how is it going? When do you have time today or tomorrow to assist with the deck prep?
[12/2/23, 11:37:59 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Do we have any info what we have sold so far from the ~100 kg? In units and quantity? 

What are the next quantities envisaged to be ordered for the US market? 

Will price per kg drop if we increase quantities?
[12/2/23, 11:42:59 AM] Val Lapidus: 1x12.5 kg sold
And 2x8oz sold
[12/2/23, 11:43:35 AM] Val Lapidus: No order plans at the moment
[12/2/23, 11:44:13 AM] Val Lapidus: Yes price should drop with volume
[12/2/23, 11:44:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s maybe have these numbers so we can plan appropriately.
[12/2/23, 11:46:41 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @16468233438 I know you have opened the sales rep commissions discussions. I believe it’s a necessary carrot if we want to have a Herbalife style decentralized sales force. I’m opening up the discussions here first as it pertains to this current business model and the once we have flushed out few options we can put it up for voting in the town hall.
[12/2/23, 11:47:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Are u asking pricing for Switzerland?
[12/2/23, 11:48:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: It will be good to form prices based on quantities and geography. We must have this info in the deck for Monday.
[12/2/23, 11:49:57 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think has the full picture of the supply chain cists

you can calculate based on receipts submitted by Orlantildes 

Exact exchange rate charged by bank and fees are not evident yet

Fatima has yet made withdrawal from the OffChain USD balance maintained in my personal bank account
[12/2/23, 1:40:24 PM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 I have asked our Brazilian supplier what type of price discounts there are when we order in larger quantities like 500 kilos or 1000 kilos I Will let you know when he responds
[12/2/23, 2:12:15 PM] Val Lapidus: @Val, we are going through a moment of high volatility in the price of almonds and you can follow this on the website investing.com. This year cocoa has already increased by approximately 70% and continues to increase.
Despite this, we can, yes, grant a discount for larger volumes.
Next week I will send our portfolio valid for the month of December here in the group. Every beginning of the month I will send you a new portfolio.
[12/2/23, 2:49:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Ok. Thanks. We need to be exact in forming prices and account for rising costs. The more current and anticipatory info the better.
[12/2/23, 2:50:33 PM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 let me know about tomorrow. It’s important we dial in the deck.
[12/2/23, 2:50:43 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't know if there's a futures market for accountants, but you could look at leaps if there are and see what they're prising. Pretend
[12/2/23, 2:51:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Accountants I mean cacao nibs
[12/2/23, 2:54:21 PM] Vlatko Gigov: There is, but that’s at bulk. We are not there yet :)

[12/2/23, 5:59:59 PM] Gary Teh: The most equitable approach would be for the commission pay out to be done fully in TDG only. 

People who wants to cash out their TDG for fiat needs to go exchange them at official venues 

Having a component in our comps that pays out Fiat directly to participants undertaking any DAO related activity also sends out a *_very negative signal*_ to people familiar with cryptocurrency tokenomics 

When I studied the tokenomics presented to me by Nio in Dubai (_*who does pump and dump professionally*_) that is usually the back door he uses to drain the fiat from any tokenomics system he comes up with

And that is exactly how Ethan did it for his project wonderhero, another mainland Chinese enabled *_pump and dump scheme*_ that took place in Singapore ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 6:02:17 PM] Gary Teh: I am open for the commission payout to be done in TDG 

And also for the commission payout formula that includes *_sales figure secured_* and *_DAO standard rate*_

Folks who are keen to crack their brains at it please feel free to surface some formula for consideration 

And then have the formula submitted in our @120363111951279022@g.us for voting 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/2/23, 6:06:59 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I nor anyone else needs this. don’t think that the profits we generate are going to help us individually
[12/2/23, 6:07:09 PM] Vlatko Gigov: We are here only to disintegrate
[12/2/23, 6:07:49 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 👆
[12/2/23, 6:09:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: maybe I’m wrong
[12/2/23, 6:10:32 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to point out that the margins on the possible commissions are not all that high. Because our price is already high and compared to other vendors, we need to be able to stay competitive while also offering a feel good story.  And one more point, there's no reason that those of us that are in developing countries can't do sales in the US or for that matter. Any territory where we can import the product into and collect on those commissions.  I think with a decent internet connection, you can make phone calls into the US. Find vendors that you want to send the sample to communicate with those vendors, get their address where to send their sample and then ask me to send out the sample.
[12/2/23, 6:11:33 PM] Val Lapidus: Everyone in this DAO can become part of the go-to market, and sell the product
[12/2/23, 6:11:39 PM] Val Lapidus: And earn commission
[12/2/23, 6:25:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with you @16468233438
[12/2/23, 6:26:32 PM] Vlatko Gigov: So let’s map out the whole process in a nice % and value based timeline to get everyone accounted for
[12/2/23, 6:26:55 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Calling for an epistemological exercice in this inner circle
[12/2/23, 6:27:10 PM] Vlatko Gigov: D DAO is all about definitions.
[12/2/23, 6:28:43 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Maybe this is how we solve for inflation. Or maybe I am a communist
[12/2/23, 8:09:24 PM] Gary Teh: *Parts required*

1) verbal script that any DAO member can follow when telling Agroverse story 

2) a protocol which they can follow in DAO to work the script
[12/3/23, 9:49:05 AM] Gary Teh: For verbal script if someone want to come  up with an initial draft that has been tested to work, that would be great.

We can then modify this shared script as we use it to iterate with prospective buyers 🙂🙏
[12/3/23, 1:07:37 PM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply

[12/16/23, 3:30:35 PM] Gary Teh: Current pricing based on *3KG* from cooperative definitely will not match his target price… 

Current rate is at *USD6.15* per pound

Perhaps check with Orlantildes to see what his price is 

Worst case scenario, since the purpose of Agroverse is to help restore the rainforest, then perhaps Agroverse could consider foregoing all profit taking from future transactions 

_*Scenario A: If potential USA buyers have their own FSVP process already setup*_

 we could consider just providing them the contact details of Orlantildes and they could just deal with Orlantildes directly. 

Meanwhile we stop further deployment of human effort behind Agroverse initiative and if human effort does get involved, people contributing effort should just consider it *_charity work*_

*_Scenario B: if potential USA buyer does not have FSVP process setup and wants to utilize Agroverse FSVP infrastructure*_

We charge a fixed one off fee for each purchase

But buyer will have to conduct all the aliasing themselves and logistics arrangements themselves

Service provided by Agroverse should just be considered a self service solution with minimal to no hand holding provided by any DAO member

Ideally the Agroverse website should just allow them to simply fill up a form and pay up to receive shipment from all prevetted FSvP approved cooperatives

Price to be charged is then up to the cooperatives to keep updated ‎<This message was edited>

I have spent many years traversing the different parts of our world overland. 

I am in awe of the beauty and diversity I saw during my travels, its people, its culture and its nature. 

I very much hope that my daughter when she grows up will get to experience this same sense of awe when she sees how beautiful this world is

Right now I am contributing to a community project to help restore our rainforest 

This project involves distributing cacao nibs that are grown using regenerative techniques in the Atlantic rainforest  

could I get your help to safeguard this beautiful world of ours for our dearly loved ones 🙂🙏

I have forwarded our Agroverse website and whitepaper to him. These along with three bags of samples I am bringing over to Switzerland with me will be featured during the Systemic Change Forum happening in Davos on the 13th of Jan. It will be in an intimate setting with a few participants. We will make some chocolate with these samples and share with the guests there

Meanwhile he has also extended invitation to another private forum that will be happening on the 17th. I understood that the CEOs of Unilever and Chanel will be present. During that session we will be exploring how we can transition our economy from one of fear and greed to one that is based on compassion 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/27/23, 5:01:12 PM] Gary Teh: You definitely should. It will surface all your past trauma, mental and emotional blocks for you to work on during your 4 hour session consulting with the mushroom. It is a highly beneficial experience for people who seek to live life on the edge much like how you have been living. 

Much like ayuhuasca or even extended period of sitting meditation, you will come away from the experience with less needless striving in your life and more time just being in the state of flow by simply allowing the universe to naturally unfold.

It is not just chocolate you are buying. You are buying a future for your kids 🙂🙏

When you buy our cacao you know exactly which portion of this wonderous ecosystem your money is being channeled towards to help with ecosystem preservation and regeneration

Right now farmers are throwing in the towel and opting to sell off their land cheaply to mainland Chinese entrepreneurs who are then chopping down the forest to grow soy bean.

The reason they give up is because middle men are siphoning off the margins for their own personal gains. Siphoning off the future of your children ‎<This message was edited>

Cost of Kraft pouch: USD0.64

A match is when activities incoming member desire to undertake matches needs of guild over the upcoming 90 day period. Otherwise we keep the slot empty.

Thoughts? 🙂🙏

[2/6/24, 6:20:04 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I relooked into our costing of our most recent shipment from Brazil into USA

*Cost of the goods itself*
- 100KG cacao nibs: $R6500 = USD1,310.3846

*Cost of the transportation and customs* 
- _Leitl Express_ - Trucking from Ilheus to Salvador: $R1066.85 = USD215.11019
- _Omega Services_ - Air Freight from Salvador to SF Airport: $R4000 = USD806.53795
- _SeaCoast Logistics_ - Custom Clearance at SF Airport: USD561.03

If our goal is to bring cost per KG down to USD20 and still pay the farmers the fair price they are asking for than shipping and freighting cost needs to go down. 

Four options to optimize our supply chain bound for USA
- ⁠Find cheaper freight forwarding company
- ⁠Do sea freight instead of air freight
- Increase shipping volume to acquire economies of scale. _but first we need to decipher which cost is fixed and which cost is variable_
- ⁠Figure out how to do customs clearance ourselves to save on the USD561.03 by removing SeaCoast Logistics from the equation. _Doesn’t feel like Grazie is actually doing much for us but still charging us stuff_.

The ledger of records for the shipment could be found here

[2/7/24, 2:23:43 PM] Patrick - Davos: Greetings. I have been involved with a DAO based organisation called United Religions Initiative since 2008 and it was founded in 2000. For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this. It is the Proof of Point of DAO which is now 24 years old ‎<This message was edited>
‎[5/18/24, 7:45:51 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/7/24, 2:23:47 PM] Patrick - Davos: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

_Requirements_

Personally I haven’t really used the pitch deck. I mainly just walk up to them at their stores present the cacao nibs samples and have them taste it

And ask if they would be keen to place an order now or if not get their contact information to follow up again when they are at a time when they are ready to place an order

[2/10/24, 1:26:09 PM] Suheil - Europe: the premier case is being used largely now by brands like L’oreal and others . brands that have no direct connection with their consumers as most of their products are sold via 3rd parties.

which can be our case when sold viia 3rd parties. but if we are anyways selling directly then NFT has no real use as we anyways have their direct contact database

[5/23/24, 10:50:51 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes doing the mathematics on cause put back difference between shipping half a ton and 1 ton

Let’s arrange a time to look through the recent samples that Orlantildes sent over when I am in town
[2/20/24, 2:21:53 AM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363044028036610@g.us* 

Exploitative middlemen diminish earnings for cacao and commodity farmers. Meanwhile, in developing nations, land is sold cheaply to Chinese corporations, transforming it into soybean and cattle farms, contributing to deforestation and climate change. How do we break this vicious cycle?
[5/30/24, 6:36:53 PM] Gary Teh: Be headed over to Ilheus thereafter
[2/20/24, 2:22:24 AM] Gary Teh: And this seems to be the set of hypotheses that @120363044028036610@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to crowdsource the setup and operations of a supply chain

- ⁠crowdsourcing can yield produces that restore communities and regenerates environment 

- ⁠integrity can be crowdsourced to tackle existing fraud in shipping industry which has caused banks to stop issuing Letter of Credits

- ⁠setup outreach script to use on influencers 

- ⁠test script on at least 25 influencers with at least 1000 followers and attempt to onboard them

_That objective is something that @16468233438 decided he wanted to undertake because that aligns well with his profile strength._

_I just realized I got distracted from my core focus when @12245781775, @41799155602 and @19209806391 reached out late last year regarding @16468233438 objective 😱_

[5/31/24, 12:54:29 PM] Gary Teh: I’m paying a visit to Brazil on the 18th June this is my agenda for the upcoming visit.

[2/20/24, 10:53:17 PM] Gary Teh: This one would be what we would go for
[6/3/24, 8:47:09 PM] Gary Teh: Time taken to update both ledges is total of two hours
[2/20/24, 10:56:28 PM] Val Lapidus: We have 1,000 bags printed and ready to go in the US.  Let's be cognizant of that fact
[6/4/24, 7:05:51 PM] Gary Teh: So two bags of 8 ounce for $20
[2/20/24, 10:59:05 PM] Gary Teh: The cost of packing the cacao nibs into bags in USA is too high

What we could do is bring those 1000 bags over to Brazil in a hand luggage before the next shipment is prepared. That way, packing is done in Brazil instead
‎[6/4/24, 7:06:09 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/20/24, 10:59:34 PM] Gary Teh: By the way has the Brazilian cooperative received what you shipped over?
[6/4/24, 11:29:54 PM] Gary Teh: How many pounds of cacao nibs could be processed into bars in one shot using your machine?
[2/20/24, 11:00:54 PM] Val Lapidus: Let's make sure we work through the supply available in the Americas of The packed bags before we direct any packaging to happen in Brazil.  The only reason we would do a order right now for additional nibs in the US is to fulfill orders that are for large-scale bulk orders. We have no need for consumer product unless suddenly that channel starts making sales.
[6/5/24, 12:52:06 AM] Val Lapidus: Depends on what racio of nib to sugar
[2/20/24, 11:01:47 PM] Gary Teh: How is the status of the freighting cost?
[6/5/24, 12:52:29 AM] Val Lapidus: But ultimately I think 12 lbs
[2/20/24, 11:02:13 PM] Val Lapidus: I will tabulate this information on the 23rd when I return home
[6/5/24, 12:55:05 AM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Willow she mentioned would be keen to get pure cacao bars at 1 pound each for her ceremonies

I think we should figure out how to package this bars like the way we did with our cacao nips
[2/20/24, 11:04:08 PM] Gary Teh: It is important to lock down the business development task and make sure our package printing supplier based in Brazil have what they need to immediately start operating when we press the START button 

Otherwise that will hamper sales and marketing activities once that side ramps up

As the Brazilian coop mentioned lag time is 2 months ‎<This message was edited>

[2/23/24, 10:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we have collected more qualitative data from the market on⁩ cacao nibs 

*Marketing 4Ps of our cacao nibs re-examined*

_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality because of care and deliberate attention during processing 
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

[2/26/24, 2:25:15 PM] Suheil - Europe: so to make sure my lately dumb braiin gets it , just to update the bullet points mentioned iin the meessage of before?
[6/9/24, 2:28:22 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 10 hours yesterday at the booth yesterday from 7am to 5pm
[2/26/24, 3:00:44 PM] Gary Teh: Here are the bullet points:

• Larger sized chunks for better quality and more crunch
• Balanced taste due to careful processing
• Fresher product with less time on shelf
• More flavorful with a satisfying crunch
• Sustainable farming technique that restores rainforests
• Competitive pricing without sacrificing quality

These points highlight the unique selling points of our cacao nibs
[6/9/24, 2:40:46 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes researching and reaching out to the farming cooperative CEPOTX that is based in the state of Altamira, Amazon Brazil
[2/27/24, 2:02:38 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 How much lag time do you think you will need to pack the rest of the 300 bags of cacao nibs from our existing stock pile in California?

Some of the influencers have a very sizable following. In a home run scenario, we will be out of stock while demand still surges in. That will lead to bad reputation on our side and discourage these influencers from collaborating with us due to poor supply chain management. 

Let me know. What are you thoughts on calibrating demand to the supply that we have right now?

_PS: we have lost Neil for his influencer posting opportunity as he had to wait a month before receiving his shipment. And he is apprehensive that his followers end up experiencing the same wait time_ ‎<This message was edited>

Just need to populate the top of the funnel with leads gathered using GetData.IO and then manually work them through the pipeline 

It’s basically a numbers game at this point 🙂🙏

[3/2/24, 1:10:01 PM] Val Lapidus: crunchier.  why?  you arent’ comparing it to anything.  shouldn’t it just be crunchy
[6/14/24, 7:43:48 PM] Gary Teh: It’s been five hours last night serving cacao at the NUS alumni event
[3/2/24, 1:10:16 PM] Val Lapidus: seems like a grammatical mistake to me.
[6/15/24, 11:14:37 PM] Gary Teh: I spent five minutes following up with Anna to request for the package design
[3/2/24, 1:14:57 PM] Val Lapidus: also I believe our nutritional info is incorrect:
https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1890432/nutrients

at a quick glance this product has 6g of carb for 3 tbsp, which is not keto friendly at all.  
calculated by using: Total Carb (11g) - Dietary Fiber (5g) = 6g net carb
according to US FDA document that I linked above, it should be:
Total Carb(10g) - Dietary Fiber (8.99g) = 1.01 net carb which is much more Keto friendly

sellers should quote any request for 100kg or more, should quote the 25-100kg price, this way you have room for negotiation, also anything over the price guidance becomes your commission

[3/7/24, 1:31:24 AM] Gary Teh: Will need to figure out the proper accounting treatment for this sale that does not cause an infarction into the agreement listed in shipment contract AGL2.

Basically if we are selling the 25kg right at the new price we will be selling it at a loss 

This doesn’t reflect well to future investors when we surface the financial performance history to them when we want to bring in the 1 ton cacao nibs… aka USD21K++

_PS: I am short of liquidity on my side. I won’t be financing the next shipment. So if we can’t find any financiers to come up with the necessary capital to finance the USD21K, there is be no future Agroverse cacao nibs shipment into USA_

_hope it is becoming apparent why I am taking the profitability of this AGL2 shipment so seriously_

_I am using the performance of AGL2 as evidence that we have a working viable model for future fundraising purposes 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

[3/7/24, 8:49:04 AM] Gary Teh: After further consideration, there is No reason to justify offloading AGL2 inventory at a lost now

Direct to consumer Sales and marketing has just started revving up. 

If we start depleting our inventory at a loss before the effects of our sales and marketing efforts start manifesting, we will just end up shooting ourselves in the foot 

This will just reflect very badly to future investors in AGL contracts who can conclude the AGL contracts are managed by a bunch of incompetent imbeciles who don’t know what they are doing ‎<This message was edited>

It is the number we get when registering our company with FDA as an importer

[3/8/24, 5:29:26 PM] Gary Teh: On cultural differences…

People from first world countries like Singapore, western Europe and America have very different expectations than people from 3rd world countries have very different expectations on how the world is supposed to work. 

Reminds me of my first time backpacking through Cambodia, a 3rd world country, when I was still in colleague 

It was a very frustrating experience but very insightful 🙂🙏

PS: once I got it in my head that time is very very flexible in 3rd world countries, the level of frustration drop to almost non-existence. 

When I was at the border of Cambodia 5 minutes of wait time actually means 7 hours of wait time ‎<This message was edited>

[3/10/24, 11:00:01 AM] Gary Teh: I have given more thought to the commission structure proposed

This approach is not going to be cost effective, time conserving and capital efficient 

*_Proposed alternative*_
Once minimal
Viable growth model is proven for chocolatier distribution route , we should start redirecting parts of the profits to retain the service of a call center to work through the sales lead list using a call script which have been tested to work. 

*_Advantages to this approach*_
- doesn’t rely on self-motivation

- ⁠doesn’t rely on whether contributor has time and availability to get stuff done 

- ⁠it becomes the employees full time job with a fixed weekly quota of calls he needs to hit. That will be defined in the SLA agreement we set in place with the call center

- visiting the two farm facilities CEPOTX 

- ⁠discussion with CFO during lunch 

- ⁠understanding local processing and packaging options (AliExpress)

- ⁠understanding cooperative price setting process for organic cacao. 

- ⁠Last year was 2X cacao futures market price 

- ⁠right now bulk price in the market is $50-60 Reis per KG. Which is around more than US$10 per KG.

- ⁠ so organic price when it is set should be more than $20 per KG. 

- ⁠Prices are almost equivalent to the prices of Coopercabruca in Bahia

- ⁠ right now there are no supplies in the market for organic Cacao

- ⁠ prices for the organic cacao will be set once all the 130 family have completed their harvest

Thanks 🙂🙏

He has a contact list for supply chain that will absorb up to 22 tons per month of chocolate into just San Francisco Bay Area

We already figured out how to ship cacao nibs into USA last year before I entered into the monastery

- ⁠Commission to influencer: USD1.2

- ⁠Target sales per sample: USD48

*Statistics by TikTok platform on influencers*
- Average revenue generated per 1000 views on TikTok based on their provided statistics is *USD15*. 

*TikTok influencers filter condition*
- 1 sample translates to 1 video
- ⁠1 video needs to generate USD48 of sales
- Shortlisted ⁠Influencer’s average video needs to generate at least *4000 views* for us to break even on the sample we ship out to her

[7/23/24, 8:02:41 PM] Gary Teh: To make 4 L of molasses 8 L of cacao honey is added with four KG of sugar

If we don’t feel comfortable with this, we can choose to not include it in the upcoming shipment

Personally, I’m really agnostic about this

[7/23/24, 9:41:27 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I don’t think we should say that it doesn’t have added sugar when in fact does. It takes away credibility from the brand.

[7/23/24, 9:43:13 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I feel like you could either focus of marketing cacao honey and claim is NO added sugars. Or you have molasses but be transparent about the high added sugar.
[7/23/24, 9:46:28 PM] Gary Teh: I think to market cacao honey, we need to find a factory that knows how to can it and preserve the content. I am sure the US market would love it. And there is not something like this in the market yet.
[7/23/24, 9:47:00 PM] Gary Teh: That is very true. We should just be very transparent about it.

I am going to field test this 100 bottles at the Autumn Okanogen Barter Faire in Washington state as well as the Arizona High desert during quartzite. If the demographic is receptive and we do sell out on the Molasses, we double down on it and scale up this product inventory ‎<This message was edited>

[7/24/24, 9:45:57 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 this was not a normal package.  It is not simply me going to my basement pulling out two packs and getting them ready.  If a customer has a special request to have the nibs processed prior to shipment, we should set an expectation that it will ship within 7 days of order.  This will help me align my time in order to facilitate a special order.  I have no issue shipping normal orders where it's just me putting it into a package but this required extra processing and extra work on my part.  With that said, I'll issue you a tracking number in just one moment
[7/24/24, 9:51:08 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm trying to log into stamps.com to print out a shipping label.  I remember now we talked about you canceling the stamps.com subscription.  Am I supposed to pay for the shipping out of my pocket?

I think we want to sell in the US should all be produced in Brazil and package ready for sale in the future

I don’t have direct access to the factory in São Paulo yet. I only have Dany as a contact person who connected me with this supplier.
The manufacturer in São Paulo shipped the sample to Dany who lives in Goiânia, in the state of Goiás. From Goiânia, Dany shipped the sample to Robert in Arkansas.
[7/25/24, 9:34:55 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: To this address you have circled is Dany’s address.
[7/25/24, 9:36:15 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: The plan so far is to wait for Robert to receive the sample and if he likes and want to explore this supplier, I will arrange with Dany to connect you, Gary, with the São Paulo supplier so you can work the deal for Robert.
[7/25/24, 9:37:50 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: So, @14153000019, once the sample is approved by Robert, I will connect you with the São Paulo supplier through Dany, and Robert will get his butter from them through you.

Let me know if that’s not how it should flow.

The supplier to the FSVP importer on record with FDA and then to Robert’s company
[7/25/24, 9:58:13 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Awesome 😎
On the right track then 🙏🏼

Sample should be in Arkansas by Tuesday, if we give him a couple days to check it out and make a batch sample we should have some answers from Robert by the end of next week. I’ll keep you posted 🫡

[7/27/24, 11:03:42 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes with Ian and Emelin today discussing about getting their help to call chocolate and health and wellness companies based in San Francisco on the phone so that @16468233438 could just go visit the shops once the appointments has been set up

Both of them graduated with degree in international negotiations. Unfortunately, there was no such opportunities for jobs in this area. 

Ian specializes in package design too 

Both of them work for this Portuguese marketing company as their day job 

Emelin mentions she will be reviewing our content, marketing strategy, and providing suggested updates ‎<This message was edited>

[7/27/24, 4:03:02 PM] Gary Teh: Spend 15 minutes hooking up Emelin and Ian to the outreach initiative that @16468233438 is currently working on in San Francisco Bay Area
[7/27/24, 4:19:08 PM] Gary Teh: @14102184337 what is the strategy you are following for marketing outreach?

Ian and emelyn mentioned they would be happy and open to making calls to set appointments 

Let me know if this is something that you might find helpful for your outreach as well ‎<This message was edited>
[7/27/24, 4:26:32 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I haven’t crafted out a strategy yet. I would like to reach out to local stores because I believe my local area is rich in high end natural stores and the public here is very receptive to this type of product. I am not comfortable approaching local retailers to make initial contact without a portfolio or something.

Yes, I would love to be on calls that would help me in this process. Just let me know what you need from me to set up the calls.
[7/27/24, 4:27:46 PM] Gary Teh: Which site we can reference to generate a contact list 

Best if you can provide some url
[7/27/24, 4:28:15 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I don’t understand
[7/27/24, 4:29:03 PM] Gary Teh: For example, performing a search on yelp for the list of companies that you would like outreach assistance for

[7/28/24, 11:27:01 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes discussing with Matheus on what is expected for the raw video footages

- Footage just needs to be submitted to the Agroverse channel by Saturday so that they could be shared on Sunday to @916380555310 and she has enough time to start using them to populate the Monday and Wednesday slots
- ⁠ when paying for fuel expenses take a photo of the receipts and send to me submit here in the Agroverse channel. So that we can use it for USA tax reporting purposes.
- ⁠ Monday slots are for about the culture of Ilheus chocolate culture
- ⁠ Wednesday slots are about the chocolate industry and chocolate farming
- ⁠ format should be portrait 
- ⁠ should also include commentary byMatheus
- ⁠ can include portrait photos, but must also have videos
- ⁠ I will transfer him R$500 first day of every month via Pix to cover the fuel cost ‎<This message was edited>

[7/30/24, 7:25:29 PM] Gary Teh: I’m thinking the unique value proposition (_UVP_) might be different for the manufacturers (_like Robert_) and the grocers 

Reason is because we are selling packaged product to the grocers and raw materials to the manufacturers

Pain point of grocers is the ability to provide something that’s highly differentiated compared to the larger retail chains out so that consumers will visit their shop as opposed to just Walmart or Safeway which offer products that are cheaper and provide more variety

*_Our UVP to them: a product that consumers know when they buy helps restore the Amazon rainforest_*

manufacturers already have their own product. However, climate change is disrupting their supply chain thereby eating into their profit margin. What they are hoping for is the ability to protect their profit margin while still fulfilling their customer’s demand

*_our UVP to them, the ability to take control of their own Supply Chain, be fully in charge of their company’s own destiny  and no longer subjected to the oppression of the large middleman_*

Something to keep in mind when interacting with the two different customer profiles

Some of those places in Durango I have personal contact with.
Can I run through this list and contact some of them personally instead of them getting call from Matheus?
[8/4/24, 12:45:47 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Just saying because like I mentioned, I’ve been in this area since 2017. I worked as a compliance officer for 4 years at a local bank so I personally know a lot of the owners of those establishments .
[8/4/24, 12:46:39 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Can I have next week to contact the ones I have access to myself and leave the other ones to @557391090002 or Matheus can focus on helping Val next week while I contact them.
[8/4/24, 12:47:35 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Unless there’s a reason I’m not aware about. Which is fine. 😊

Just thinking it will be weird for Matheus to call and then me to show up and then to say “Hey Milena, why you didn’t reach out to begin with?” 😅
[8/4/24, 12:48:18 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: On another note, it might be beneficial since Matheus knows a bit more about the Agroverse than I do.

Just trying to bring your attention to this matter. Let me know what you would ultimately like to do.

On the question about product attributes 

The word we should focus on is not *_better*_ but *_different*_

The *_Difference*_ that matters to our target audience in the USA ‎<This message was edited>
‎[8/7/24, 11:28:02 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/8/24, 12:01:21 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes crafting up the product attribute sheet which differentiates the cacao nibs we are bringing into the USA compared to other cacao nibs that are available in the USA market

_Core Product Attributes:_

1. _Unique Flavor Profile_: Fine flavored organic cacao nibs with up to 90% fermentation, resulting in a strong aromatic flavor.
2. _Balanced Taste_: Suitable as a snack on its own, unlike other cacao nibs which are often used as raw ingredients.
3. _Competitive Pricing_: On par with or slightly lower than USA competitors due to supply chain optimization.
4. _Fermentation Level_: Up to 90% fermentation, compared to 70% or no fermentation in other cacao nibs.
5. _Post-Fermentation Processing_: Calibrated drying and roasting for the American taste bud, enhancing the flavor profile.
6. _Freshness_: Imported in small batches to ensure optimal freshness and crunchiness.

_Augmented Attributes:_

1. _Award-Winning Cacao_: International Cacao Excellence Award winner for 3 consecutive years.
2. _Single-Sourced_: Traceable to specific farms, ensuring transparency and quality control.
3. _Sustainable Farming_: Grown using traditional Cabruca Agroforestry method, promoting aforestation and reducing deforestation.
4. _Fair Trade Practices_: Farmers receive 34% of profits, encouraging continued use of sustainable farming methods.
5. _Environmental Impact_: Cabruca method balances land nutrients, eliminating the need for fertilizers and pesticides.
6. _Supply Chain Optimization_: Efficient supply chain management ensures competitive pricing without compromising quality.
7. _Region-Specific_: Sourced from Bahia, where unique terroir and climate conditions contribute to the distinct flavor profile.
8. _Texture_: Crunchy texture due to small-batch importing and optimal freshness.

This revised sheet highlights the added benefit of small-batch importing, ensuring the cacao nibs are exceptionally fresh and crunchy. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/14/24, 8:55:59 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 I was thinking of the discussion we had the other day

I think for the earnings of tokens for running of live events should also indicate what the three photos you suggested to submit should look like

Otherwise, any members could just come into the channels and declare they ran a 10 hour event and claim tokens without providing anything to substantiate it
[8/14/24, 8:59:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, tue. I can include it in the Marketing Strategy. By today, afternoon, I can send you this first document, including the requirements for recipes videos and event images.
[8/14/24, 9:03:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yesterday I meet with @557391090002 to align the path we will walk together in the marketing team. All the tasks done, insights, will be posted here today. Something really nice is coming!
[8/14/24, 9:19:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 18 minutes this morning talking with @557391090002 and Suchitra trying to coordinate a virtual meeting with both of them, so we can become acquainted and be clear that everybody understood their assignments with no miscommunication.
[8/14/24, 9:40:06 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We shall meet on 15th august at 9:00 AM (Emelin and @557391090002) and at 18h30 (Suchitra).
[8/14/24, 11:40:44 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 4 1/2 hours doing inspection of two facilities today

One Itabuna for the production of Cacao nibs and Cacao liquor operated by Santos

The other in Ilheus for the production of Cacao liquor operated by Wesley

The first facility seems large enough to house additional machines to increase production capacity for Cacao butter

The second facility failed inspection

Will be following up with Robert once I’m done visiting the third facility in São Paulo to be organized by @14102184337 next week 

There after I’ll head to Florianopolis to visit the factory that will be producing the machines for making cacao butter that Santos is proposing for purchase ‎<This message was edited>

[8/14/24, 5:03:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Last night, I met with @557391090002 from 8:20 PM to 11:50 PM, totaling 3 hours and 30 minutes, during which we:

1. Reviewed the marketing strategy and the deliveries, the monthly content matrix, and discussed the metrics to follow for August planning.

2. Addressed the content matrix to check competencies and distribute tasks based on Matheus's delivery possibilities (time to create, edit, buy ingredients to create the recipes, send me for review and with me, help with the art content for the posts).

3. We inspected the creation studio where the reels and materials will be produced during the recordings. We checked the lighting, location, and equipment. As a request from @14153000019 and agreed by me and Matheus, all the video content and event content (photos, videos) from the community will follow some requirements established by me to be attached to the Marketing Strategy paper and after Gary's analysis, submitted and open to the DAO.
[8/14/24, 6:17:55 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002

Part of the discussion I had with @557191035605 was to iterate on the call script and to improve it over time.

Basically it is about delivering CTA in specific order to drive up the highest conversion rate possible in the sales development pipeline

CTA = call to action ‎<This message was edited>

By monday she will receive the copywriting for august (2 weeks left), and by the end of the month, she will also receive september excel sheet with the copies, time to be posted, date to be posted and the hashtags to be created also by me, using tools as Answer the Public and Google Alert. We will have our first post of the week tomorrow and then, we will follow the monthly content for these 2 weeks of august non stop.
[8/15/24, 11:51:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 17:19 talking with @557391090002 about the reels. His request was to have less reels created due the time between creation, editing and delivery. After negotiation and agreement, we are keeping the 4 reels divided (2 recipe reels and 1 agroverse and the connection with reforestation and as a community plus 1 video with the theme chosen by me) 4 HD pictures of lifestyle, farms, cocoa, ingredients, recipes processes, people interacting with the product and with the cacao).
[8/15/24, 11:52:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The sessions are recorded, the first one with @916380555310 contains one part of the talk, as the other part we were having in the marketing group.

[8/16/24, 7:07:35 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes responding to Orlantildes email via WhatsApp

The process he quoted has deviated too much from our priorly agreed upon mathematical formula for calculating prices

Depending on his response, it could be construed as him breaking trust on his side and we cancelling the entire purchase order

This is a very critical

After factoring, all the costs and the markups here in Brazil there does not seem to be a profit margin to be made if we freighted the shipment to USA

[8/18/24, 9:07:52 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 10 minutes explaining to @557191035605 how to derive the reasonable price of organic Cacao nibs from current commodity market price

_current commodity market price = USD$7.087_

_Organic Cacao price versus commodity price = 2X_

_Conversion rate of Cacao almond to Cacao nips = 1 : 1.25_

_cost of processing of per KG Cacao almond: USD1.5_

Expected cost price of organic cacao nibs
USD$7.087 X 2 X 1.25 + USD$1.50 = *USD$19.2175* ‎<This message was edited>

[8/21/24, 7:56:09 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 

I spent time thinking through the data that has came my way on the way expenses have been incurred for our content marketing efforts 

What I have observed for the past two weeks is that all the expenses both food ingredients and transport has been incurred by @557191035605 

Regarding the accounting and disbursement of the *_R$500 monthly budget*_ that I have set aside for our content marketing efforts, instead of transferring all of them to @557391090002 on the first day of each month, the new approach will be to disburse them to the reporter (_either @557191035605 or @557391090002_) within 2 banking days via Pix as soon as the reciept for the expenses has been submitted in this channel, validated and acknowledged by me 

*Reason for the change*

- The way the budget gets disbursed becomes more accountable 

- The reporter experiences less waiting time before receiving reimbursement for expenses incurred 

- The way the expenses gets disbursed becomes more equitable to the actual person (_either @557391090002 or @557191035605_) incurring the expenses. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/21/24, 7:57:05 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes thinking through the logic of our content marketing expenses reimbursement process
[8/21/24, 8:03:11 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes poking the President of CEPOTX cooperative and thinking through our cacao financing budget allocation

My resolution is that if we do not identify another viable supplier from the *_state of Bahia*_ by end of this month, the financing budget we have allocated for purchase of cacao shipment to the USA this year will all be directed to CEPOTX based in Para 

This means bumping up our purchase of cacao from 100kg to 500kg from *_CEPOTX in Para*_ 

If we are able to find an indigenous community that produces cacao in the *_state of Amazonas*_ during this period too, we will direct part of our financing budget to the newly identified indigenous supplier.

[8/21/24, 10:31:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: My proposal:
[8/21/24, 10:31:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Video Content: keeping @557391090002 for video content, focusing on producing 3 high-quality videos (2 recipe videos and 1 on environment/farmers related to Agroverse or on Agroverse's economy model), based on @Gary Teh's expense proposal.

Design Replacement: Replace @916380555310with a skilled designer, such as Ian Sá, to handle static posts creation with me, scheduling, and other tasks, using the same budget that @916380555310 Suchitra used to only schedule and create copies for the videos. This was also base on the +9 hours time zone difference.

Marketing Management: I will be managing all aspects of marketing, including strategy development, advertising campaigns when they come, social media management, copywriting, art assistance, analysis, reporting, team coordination, and adaptation.
[8/21/24, 10:32:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I will be online for further clarification.

[8/21/24, 11:24:52 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 was notified by the kitchen I use that they are losing their lease.  Let me know if I need to search for another kitchen for packaging.
[8/21/24, 11:27:39 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, please do so. 

Or even better, figure out how to get our own kitchen certified. I know Robert who is based in Arkansa did that.

That way, we can potentially ship our own machines from China to USA to process from cacao almonds to the following derivatives

- cacao nibs
- ⁠cacao liquor/mass / aka 100% bar

I checked on Alibaba.com the machine to remove shell and convert cacao almonds to nibs is not very expensive. 
The cheapest is around USD$250 

Apart from that all we need is a roaster (_regular oven would work_)
[8/21/24, 11:28:46 AM] Val Lapidus: I have the machine that converts to liquor
[8/21/24, 11:29:05 AM] Gary Teh: Nice!

Its similar to the passing of laws in Legal systems. When a judge passes a judgement on a case, judges considering future cases of similar nature must then take the current case and its judgement into consideration when judging future cases. This is to ensure the legal system is consistent.

There are loads of them. I think more than 100GB 🤯🤣
[8/22/24, 12:59:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 2 minutes posting on the stories.
[8/22/24, 1:01:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: More time I spend on Instagram, I realize you actually generated great content we can reuse now and then, or posts relating to a story. The content is great, it just got lost because of the lack of organization before, balancing reels and posts to explain more what you were actually doing in your trips.
[8/22/24, 1:01:56 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔
[8/22/24, 1:03:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The content was there but the necessary preview information was not, due to the lack of titles. At some point I will organize this with @557381610166

The video can be used as a template and for now we have two different videos to be used as standard (font, kind of videos, images), how to use the logo, so @557391090002 can work with this to do the videos.

Will keep crawling through them until I can’t find anymore new Brazilian cacao farmers profiles and then start reaching out.
[8/23/24, 12:01:44 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes following up with Everton to find out the details of doing a triangular trade that he described last year

Where the farmer, cooperative or factory sell the Cacao to a CNPJ company that we will be setting up here in Brazil and the CNPJ company invoices the USA company

But his freighting company just picks up the Cacao from the farm corporative or factory and ship it directly to San Francisco and the CNPJ company does not have to deal with the logistic at all

That way, we only have to do FDA certification once for the CNPJ company for all future agriculture exports from Brazil into USA

[8/25/24, 11:20:36 PM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: TrueTech Inc spent 6 minutes editting a spread sheet for Emelin, in order for it to be used for planning content for social media posts.
[8/26/24, 9:51:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I would like to share some perspective on the social media here. Many followers are from Brazil. Probably people who were meeting Gary along the way. I expect a reduction in Brazilians followers due to the content we started to share and english is not our second language here. Because of this, a reduction in followers is expected until we get to redirect to our target public in the US.
[8/26/24, 9:53:23 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Also, I had some research and saw that Brazilians and north Americans act different in social media. In Brazil, we tend to follow by content but also, because we considered something beautiful. We find a function for that. In the US, people prefer to follow brands they already know, that they trust, that they see as "not a scam". It is a tendency to go for the known instead of the unknown.
[8/26/24, 9:54:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because of this, the search for influencers is necessary. It will make people connect more and see themselves reflected on that person.
‎[8/26/24, 9:59:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[8/26/24, 10:00:57 AM] Emelin - Bahia: At this point, we need to reach influencers to make people in the US more comfortable with the brand. Consistency is also something that will keep us on the road. But @14153000019 what do we have to offer influencers and how was your approach with the shaman Willow?
[8/26/24, 10:02:36 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Still, it doesn't mean people will follow us, we are talking about the reach. For followers, we need to keep with the consistency of our posts and stories, using the material we already have because it will help people to see it is real, that the connection with Brazil is real, that the product is real and I aligned that posting client's pictures on the stories and also in the highlights, that is why is so important to feature them as well.
[8/26/24, 10:03:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I would like to have a meeting with you to know how your process going on Facebook has been so far in order to see how it can helps us reach the communities and groups we are interested.
[8/26/24, 10:03:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And also, to understand more of the behaviour. We also need to talk about the events.
[8/26/24, 10:12:03 AM] Gary Teh: Basically I offered my presence and friendship as well as the sharing of cacao when we are face to face. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/26/24, 10:15:29 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. My behavior has been to offer Free Amazonian cacao drinks at our cacao circles in USA during hippie festivals, technology events or during my personal spiritual wayfaring journey in USA.

Based on your analysis seems live meetups is still going to be leading the charge for our sales and marketing efforts

While our social media strategy remains more of a retention mechanism after the initial touch base with our brand during my wayfaring journey across USA in my car sharing our story.  🤩💪🙏

[8/28/24, 9:28:57 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking since Netflix has what’s trending every week we could try to hijack the top theme that’s trending on Netflix every week and try to make our own real just to follow the trend. Makes this relatable to the folks that we are targeting.  🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

Huge part of the discussions was how to convert cacao almonds into

- cacao nibs

_PS: seems to be a recurring theme when analyzing the conversation I had with Willow Star and Sangara the other two medicine women_

_The How Tos are very important_

_They even asked for the recordings of the factory facility where the different types of Cacao derivatives transform into the other types_
[8/28/24, 1:55:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 18 minutes going through Gary's list on suppliers. I discarded some information that was irrelevant and contact one of them. Until the end of the day I will send a message to three contacts.

[8/29/24, 5:53:32 PM] Gary Teh: Spent around a total of 30 minutes today answering @557191035605 question on the suppliers ‎<This message was edited>
[8/29/24, 6:21:37 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 3 hours talking with 4 producers by phone and updating the supplier list to 19 cacao producers. I am waiting response from 2 different potential suppliers who work with organic fine cacao nibs.  One from São Paulo and the other from Itajuípe, Bahia (a small group of producers but not a cooperative).
[8/29/24, 6:22:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I update the list and added some more details useful to us and I will keep updating tomorrow as I will review it again and add the location from each one I have put there.
[8/29/24, 6:29:57 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Insights: 1. the kind of relationship we had with Coopercabruca was because of @557391090002 . With producers we don't know yet, they require 50/50 payment terms and the c.n.p.j for Agroverse would be useful to show we are reliable. 2. As the prices went high, I noticed the opening to discuss these prices which is good and also shows that talking with producers as a person in first place, not a foreign company and not mentioning it is for exportation makes it easier. 3. I Those who produce their own brand tend to have the highest price on the market for their "raw" nibs. 4. And finally I realized it get less costly for us in the end of the day to deal with small producers or groups of producers (but who has a presence online, clients comments, something we can rely on), than go after cooperatives.
[8/29/24, 6:31:36 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We are dealing with high prices right now, and the fact of being organic makes it harder and more costly. If we get something a little bit under 120,00 as R$110,00 the Dao should accept it if the wish is to have a shipment this year.
[8/29/24, 6:33:22 PM] Gary Teh: Is this the price from the group of small producers in Ilheus? ‎<This message was edited>
[8/29/24, 6:33:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 120,00 is in Itajuípe.
[8/29/24, 6:33:58 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 100,00 in São Paulo.
[8/29/24, 6:34:09 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Bahia not Ilhéus.
[8/29/24, 6:35:22 PM] Gary Teh: Is this a farm or is this a middleman?
[8/29/24, 6:35:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Farm.
[8/29/24, 6:37:33 PM] Gary Teh: Could we arrange for both of them to ship a small sample of 250grams over to your place? 

Say We can pay them via pix for the samples

[8/29/24, 6:40:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I can ask them, yes. The one from R$ 120,00, from Bahia is travelling at the moment, but I will request this tomorrow.
[8/29/24, 6:40:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: He needs to sleep on my messages.
[8/29/24, 6:40:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Both of them.
[8/29/24, 6:40:40 PM] Emelin - Bahia: And I hope they have good dreams.
[8/29/24, 6:40:45 PM] Gary Teh: After all of you have tasted them

Let me know if they are good then we can all arrange to go pay the farms a visit ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/24, 10:10:05 AM] Gary Teh: I spent $5.176182667 to reimburse @557191035605 for this uber ride
[8/30/24, 10:12:12 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Once more cocoa from Ilhéus/Salvador region are more costly than in other places in general. 2.He explained that the coca nibs produced by the same producer may vary in taste through the year due to temperature, light, humidity (rain) factors. He mentioned it is important to have that on the packaging, as the consumer may find it different in taste from one buy to the next.

_*Conclusion:*_
@16468233438 was quite right that the prices charged by Coopercabruca was way higher than if we were to source directly from the farmers even for the previous year’s shipment ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/24, 9:51:40 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 important to mention we are keeping "cacao" as word of choice. There is still a discussion going on (same one that happened on how to say the years after 2010), but let's use cacao instead of cocoa.

[9/3/24, 8:49:46 AM] Gary Teh: Based on this we could ship 120 bottles of cacao molasses to the USA with a cost price of $4.1 each 

Assuming we buy the bottles directly from the Annaluana farm at R$15 per bottle 

If we could sell the bottles for usd10 we net a profit of usd6 per bottle. That would be a total profit of usd720 for the shipment  🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

I received today his conditions to be able to deliver the nibs and I need to talk with @14153000019 so we can see what is the better approach.

[9/6/24, 9:39:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: He sent me an e-mail address to solve this with an observation: "remembering that in our plant the cocoa needs to go through classification first, to analyze the quality. If there are a lot of defects, above 3% we do not process them."
[9/6/24, 9:39:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will forward this to the supplier.

[9/6/24, 9:41:52 AM] Emelin - Bahia: He gave me a number to talk more about it. It is a woman responsible for the process.

[9/6/24, 9:42:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So the talk moves to another person.
[9/6/24, 9:42:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will make these questions to the one responsible for that.
‎[9/6/24, 9:42:39 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted

[9/6/24, 9:51:23 AM] Emelin - Bahia: If it takes more than what Coopercabruca was asking, it makes sense to take with them at this point or find another way.
[9/6/24, 9:51:28 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In my point of view.
[9/6/24, 9:51:46 AM] Gary Teh: USD $75 most likely for the cost of testing ‎<This message was edited>
[9/6/24, 9:51:51 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Or even, go through those who had it for 150,00 but the nibs ready.
[9/6/24, 9:52:54 AM] Gary Teh: At that price I think we should just put the entire Agroverse project on hold until next year ‎<This message was edited>
[9/6/24, 9:53:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What we are talking here is getting 200kg for R$ 100,00 and processing each kg for 7,50.
[9/6/24, 9:54:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: + USD $75 for the test.
[9/6/24, 9:54:51 AM] Gary Teh: You are surfacing too many items for discussions simultaneously

Now I have two cacao nibs producers on hold, because they are checking how much they can provide me in nibs. I was checking and normally the amount of the almonds is less than the amount of nibs that we can get, so I am still aiming at finding the highest quantity in organic nibs for the best price.

[9/7/24, 7:12:02 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 when we get a chance could we reach out to this NGO organization? 

I understood from the chocolatiers that this NGO maintained relationships with an entire network of these cacao farms in the para region where they are restoring our rainforest
[9/7/24, 7:12:03 PM] Gary Teh: This effort is mainly for expanding our database of cacao suppliers

[9/8/24, 11:47:16 AM] Gary Teh: I spent five minutes, finding the certification and poking @557391090002 with it
[9/8/24, 11:52:21 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 can we check with the farmers if they are able to issue a nota fiscal to Black King when we make a purchase of the cacao nibs 

This part is crucial so that we reduce the corporate tax of Black King to Zero when purchasing cargo passes through Black King’s accounting ledger 

This is so as to prevent @557391090002 from paying unnecessary taxes to the Brazilian government via the transaction that is happen
[9/8/24, 11:53:03 AM] Gary Teh: I spent five minutes, thinking through the end to end accounting of the transaction

[9/8/24, 11:55:07 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 which country has a lower corporate taxation 

USA or Brazil 

If we are a Multinational entity which does import of cacao from Brazil to USA , under which country do you suggest we book our profits on the accounting books for submission to government for taxation purposes?
[9/8/24, 11:55:08 AM] Meta AI: The country with a lower corporate taxation rate between the USA and Brazil is the USA. As of 2022, the USA has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, while Brazil has a federal corporate tax rate of 34% (25% federal tax + 9% social contribution tax).

Regarding your question about where to book profits for taxation purposes, it's a complex issue that depends on various factors, such as the entity's structure, tax residency, and transfer pricing regulations. However, I can provide some general guidance:

- If your multinational entity is a US taxpayer, it's generally beneficial to book profits in the USA, taking advantage of the lower tax rate.
- However, you must ensure compliance with US transfer pricing rules, arm's length principles, and Brazilian tax regulations.
- Consider consulting a tax professional or expert in international taxation to ensure compliance and optimize your tax strategy.

Please note that tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and this response is not a substitute for professional tax advice. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/9/24, 4:07:36 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 I just checked through @16468233438 requirements for TyTycoco

Seems He only needs 50Kg for this year. I am checking if he wants it converted to cacao liquor instead of just nibs 

Since CIC does have the facility to do that. 

So in total we only need to source for 500kg of cacao almonds. Which converts to


- Shena: 300 kg of cacao nibs 

- ⁠@16468233438 : 50 kg of cacao nibs (or liquor)

- ⁠our own requirements : 50 kg of cacao nibs

I spent 5 minutes poking @16468233438 ‎<This message was edited>

[9/9/24, 4:33:44 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 tomorrow when we visit CIC, we should check if they are able to process cacao almonds into Cacao Liquor too. 

I will be having a call on @16468233438 on Wednesday to check if he would like his supply in cacao liquor instead of Cacao nibs, since he is right now processing his nibs into liquor over in California anyways.

[9/9/24, 4:43:16 PM] Gary Teh: Just received quotation from Ewerton on freighting 300kg of cacao nibs from Bahia facility to Austin Texas airport.

I spent 5 minutes following up with him

Shipping cost is around: USD$6.2312695 / KG

Price does not include customs clearance for Brazilian side

Customs clearance on Brazilian side is additional R$1000. Additional USD$0.597445333333333 / kg

Current net excluding USA customs clearance is $6.828714833333333 / kg

If we assume custom clearance on USA side will cost the usual $500, it will be an additional $1.66 / kg

Final cost per kg will be $8.4953815 / kg ‎<This message was edited>

[9/10/24, 8:56:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will ask them if we will always need to classify the almond as weather and humidity can alter the final product, remembering we are using organic cacao, and so the final product can change.
[9/10/24, 9:04:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: For next purchases, once again we should talk with the suppliers with more time, ask their harvesting periods in the year (I will ask one of them today) so we can reduce this cost. If we had all the almonds from the same batch and farmer, it would cost only USD 17,90. If we take the cacao almonds from two farmers, but from the same batch, it would cost  only USD35,89.
[9/10/24, 9:06:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So we are paying 53,71 because one of them didn't have more cacao to provide, what made us take 200kg from the same farmer but from different batches. @14153000019 more farmers we work with, more cost we will have with the almonds' test.

Do you think you can cover me for this week?
[9/12/24, 10:12:13 AM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: Ok, I'll take care of the tasks,
[9/12/24, 10:12:53 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thank you.
[9/12/24, 10:13:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We can meet at lunchtime halfway of your house. I need to buy some stuff.
[9/12/24, 10:15:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I want to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.
[9/12/24, 10:20:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166
[9/12/24, 10:27:51 AM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: fine, we'll meet at lunchtime
