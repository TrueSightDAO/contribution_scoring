[1/31/23, 11:18:36 PM] Gary Teh: cooling seems like a recurring question asked by folks who heard about this project. I wonder if we could just transfer this heat from the miner containers to the adjacent container that grows mushroom? Mushrooms like their temperature warm but not hot.

[2/1/23, 12:11:53 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the financing aspects of this project since we will be basically acquiring undeveloped land if we went down the route of procuring it  in the desert. (The other route is if we figured out a suitable arrangement to utilize the land being offered for use by @12023686334 family. )

Technically once developed (even slightly) we might be able to apply to have it revalued at an increased valuation compared to what we acquired it for. We can then get a mortgage/loan using the land as collateral to gather funds which we could then use to procure the equipments

Via this approach we could further reduce the amount of initial fiat required to less than the initial estimated USD16K we needed to raise to get it off the ground
[2/1/23, 12:14:13 AM] Gary Teh: Francois mentioned two nights ago when I was over at his place that Arizona government is giving out a lot of grants to do RnD research into renewables right now 

So we might end up not even needing our own fiat to seed the project 🤣

[2/1/23, 9:05:54 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s a great idea! 
Also AZ = tons of ☀️ 

Few key issues for the Family ranch or anywhere else. 
1. Is access to the systems for routine maintenance. (Same question for anywhere else) who will maintain it?
2. Heat: TX and AZ gets hot. How will we keep to operating temp? How will we vent hear if we burry the containers. 
3. Growing magic mushrooms is a non starter for the family ranch. Can’t do it, 
4. No tax credits / debt options for the ranch, since we would be “leasing” space. 

Sounds like AZ land grant is in 1st place with TX ranch in 2nd followed by slab city. 

Have we looked into mining pools that house the miners and provide all the required maintenance services?

[2/1/23, 3:37:55 PM] Gary Teh: Burying the containers Underground.

[2/2/23, 11:15:08 AM] Gary Teh: I am sure we will be able to get a quotation for that
[2/2/23, 11:16:24 AM] Tres Garcia: I think we can rent a back-ho fairly cheap. 
Just need to know where the gaslines or other cables are running. 
Then you need to get the container into the ground. (Crane or Tractor) and make sure it is a) level and b) not below the water table / weighed down so it doesn't float back up.
[2/2/23, 11:16:56 AM] Gary Teh: I believe @19209806391 knows how to do that 🤔

[2/2/23, 1:09:52 PM] Gary Teh: Really? That much?

It’s retail price for buying their whole setup or is it “build your own” coating? 

Remember the cost estimates charged to government by Lockheed Martin versus those charged by SpaceX 

Even the cost of modifying the off grid rigs that I am seeing out here in the desert 

Buying the entire van  fully decked out cost more than USd100k but just buying the parts of Amazon and then assembling them the cost difference is around USD80k
[2/2/23, 1:13:47 PM] Alessandro Mele: A friend of mine rented an office with Regus and put a few miners, apparently Regus doesn’t check power consumption? I don’t find it ethical but having used Regus in the past they deserve it 😈
[2/2/23, 1:15:20 PM] Alessandro Mele: Also I was thinking that instead of putting it invthe desert it might make sense to put it where you have solar irradiation but heat demand like a hotel or swimming pool and use the extra heat for heating the rooms or the pool water? Not sure about the sizing though , maybe not enough heat?
[2/2/23, 1:17:18 PM] Gary Teh: That is a great idea!! 🤩

My assumption is at that point, we would have established an exchange rate between our governance tokens and one of the major currencies. 🤔

Seems like this is a recurring theme

Especially that land is so cheap here and getting cheaper. USD1000 per acre
[2/5/23, 1:09:20 PM] Tres Garcia: Wow! 
That’s a steal. 
Texas is $6k and up.
[2/5/23, 5:02:08 PM] Gary Teh: Jeramy and @18068313969 were both thinking we could get the nomads help for maintenance 

We will just open part of the land to let them caravan on 

Any of them that are keen should be able to scan their Solana wallet address to gain entry into the facility to do required maintenance in exchange for more governance tokens

@19514467219 idea of selling NFT to gain access to the research materials we generated during RnD seems to be sounding really interesting 

That might even be a source of the funding for our equipment
[2/6/23, 7:48:53 AM] Arie Ben David: As we know, developing a friendly project that may also regenerates the land and support healthy living requires a lot of know-how and resources...the infrustructure to support it is also significant. Cost of land depends on many veriables and demands professionals, even if at 1st phase one focuses on Energy production.

And only 1 square mile of battery to keep the power required

This seems more and more promising as I dig into it 

Also price of solar panels are just coming down more and more now that China’s border is opening up again

Some of their underground architecture looks simply amazing 🤩

And the whole town is literally running on solar panels 🤣

 https://youtu.be/ywBwXyF1UuI
[2/7/23, 2:56:03 PM] Gary Teh: @18068313969 the technique you mentioned of using the extractor to lift and then lower the 40ft container was illustrated in this video on a working prototype in California. I guess we don’t need to rent a crane after all 

https://youtu.be/Z0oFJ2jbkDI


Also based on what he mentioned the internal temperature is a consistent 80 Fahrenheit / 26 degree Celsius all day round

I suddenly recalled when I was in the military back in Singapore and was overseeing ammunition supplies to all the camps around the country, bulk of them were kept in these huge giant underground caves which we dug into the side of the hills 

It was always a nice temperature indoors even though it might be crazy hot outdoors

Strange I only just recalled this 🤔
[2/7/23, 3:34:24 PM] Gary Teh: I just recalled, when visiting @972556609556 and @41762654166the other day, we drove past the servers powering our international SWIFT monetary system on the Switzerland side (one of three such clusters around the world)

They were all running underground. 

So what we are attempting to do is not really new conceptually instead of powering the SWiFT we are powering some decentralized currency instead

[3/9/23, 2:41:29 PM] Gary Teh: Bumped into a fellow backpacker who is going to start work for a company that turns water into hydrogen and then ammonia by adding nitrogen 

This makes it easier for transport and then easily converted back to hydrogen later for entertainment usage or simply used as fertilizer
[3/9/23, 2:47:57 PM] Alessandro Mele: Interesting @14153000019 ! One of our clients is involved in the green hydrogen/ green ammonia sectors as an operating holding company investing in early stage technologies that have a significant impact in reducing the cost of producing H2/ammonia as well as providing strategic advice to large utilities / corporates and project development. I’d be interested in learning more about this company
[3/9/23, 2:52:01 PM] Gary Teh: Cool! Let me go find out their name when I bump into her at the hostel later
[3/10/23, 6:01:27 AM] Tres Garcia: Cosmic Karma… I’m actually working a Hydrogen Power project now. 

I am skeptical of anything called green hydrogen at this point, and would refer to it as green / blue arbitrage for tax credits. 

Transportation and storage are a critical issue, due to temperature and pressure requirements. 

Conversion into Ammonia is a promising avenue but comes with its own added costs and issues. 

Guess it all boils down to the use case.

[4/8/23, 10:17:02 PM] Gary Teh: This was the answer 

Implementing an off-grid data center requires careful planning and consideration of several factors such as energy efficiency, power generation, and cooling requirements. Here are some ways to implement an off-grid data center:

1. Renewable energy sources: Off-grid data centers can rely on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. By incorporating these energy sources, data centers can reduce or eliminate their reliance on traditional power sources and ensure consistent power supply. In addition, installing energy-efficient servers, power supplies, and cooling systems can help reduce energy consumption, and hence reduce costs.

2. Backup generators: Even if you choose to use renewable energy sources, backup generators are an essential part of an off-grid data center. These generators can provide power when renewable sources can't, such as during prolonged periods of cloudy weather. Generators should be regularly maintained and tested to ensure they work when needed most.

3. Efficient cooling: Managing temperatures in an off-grid data center is essential. High temperatures can cause hardware malfunctions and reduce the lifespan of servers. A common approach is to use passive cooling techniques or low-power cooling systems that reduce energy consumption without compromising performance.

4. Energy storage: Data centers can use batteries to store excess energy generated from renewable sources. This energy can be used during periods when renewable sources are not available or when demand exceeds supply. Reducing energy consumption is important, so implementing energy efficient hardware components together with storage will make the batteries last longer.

5. Location: The location of the off-grid data center is crucial since it needs to be in an area with abundant renewable energy sources, like a windy or sunny location. Additionally, the area needs to be accessible by roads, have high-speed internet connections, have low land costs, and be safe and secure.

Off-grid data centers can provide cost-saving benefits and promote environmental sustainability while ensuring business continuity. However, it requires a significant amount of investment upfront to build an efficient and reliable infrastructure for the data management process.
[4/8/23, 10:17:27 PM] Gary Teh: It seems really good at surfacing areas to consider that might have been over looked
[4/10/23, 8:58:01 PM] Gary Teh: Prompt to ChatGpt

Where is the best place in the world to setup an off grid data center that relies on solar power to mine bitcoins?

Answer in less than 100 words
[4/10/23, 8:58:13 PM] Gary Teh: Response 

The best place in the world to set up an off-grid data center that relies on solar power to mine bitcoins would need abundant sunshine, low-cost solar power, stable climates, skilled labor, favorable government policies, and access to high-speed internet. Suggested locations are Northern Africa, the Middle East, Australia, the South-Western United States, and Chile. These regions have excellent sunlight exposure, stable climatic conditions, and availability of skilled labor and have government policies that support the use of renewable energy in mining operations.
[4/11/23, 5:16:12 AM] Gary Teh: Our DAO’s purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity. 

What is the best way to monetize our DAO’s off grid data center in this age where Golem level large language AI models are rapidly gaining traction amongst the masses
[4/11/23, 5:16:21 AM] Gary Teh: To monetize your DAO's off-grid data center, the following steps could be followed:

1. Leverage Your Core Values: Leverage your core values, such as autonomy and integrity, to develop sustainability solutions with similar values. Consider developing innovative products or partnerships that emphasize these values when commercializing the off-grid data center.

2. Evaluate Market Trends: Evaluate current market trends, including the rise of large language AI models, to identify potential opportunities for providing IT infrastructure and cloud solutions, especially to businesses that require off-grid systems for higher security and performance.

3. Develop Customized Solutions: Develop customized AI solutions by incorporating off-grid data center resources, emphasizing energy efficiency and low latency, that meet customers' individual needs, such as cloud-based servers of Golem level AI models.

4. Establish Service Level Agreements: Establish service level agreements (SLAs) with customers that guarantee uptime, performance, and security while emphasizing autonomy and integrity in the contract terms.

5. Offer Training Programs: Offer training programs on the use and management of the off-grid data center, including AI modeling and programming, to expand your customer base and promote the use of sustainable solutions.

6. Explore Tokenization: Explore tokenization options, .i.e., issuing tokens in the blockchain, that represent the off-grid data center's usage, and offer them to clients as a form of payment or investment, creating additional value from the off-grid data center.

7. Promote Decentralization: Promote decentralization through token ownership, strategic alliances, and partnerships that support your DAO's core values and autonomous governance. 

8. Identify Funding Opportunities: Identify funding opportunities, such as grants or awards, that align with your DAO's core values while providing additional support for the off-grid data center initiatives.

By following these steps, your DAO can effectively monetize the off-grid data center while remaining true to its core values of autonomy, integrity, and diversity. The DAO can create value while addressing real-world problems, contributing to building a better world based on verifiable truth.

Mining Bitcoins with solar power in a shipping container 

I understand that Balneario is really popular with folks from Dubai looking to buy real estate properties. However there are already lots of folks constructing buildings in Balneario 

What is really popular and crazy right now in Dubai is cryptocurrency 

It’s almost the defacto currency hub in the world 

I was looking at various aspects of Brazilian geographical region as well as cost structure 

My sense is if we setup our first solar powered Bitcoin mining facility here, we will get a hell lot of interest from ultra high networth folks in the cryptocurrency community that is based out of Dubai
[4/17/23, 7:37:39 AM] Barbara Sandini: What are the needs to build?
So I can check the possibilities.
[4/17/23, 7:43:35 AM] Gary Teh: Here are the needs for the setup 

- cheap piece of land

- year round sunlight 

- 40 foot container 

- solar panels 

- solar controller

- deep cycle batteries 

- weather insulated wires 

- an extractor to bury the container underground 

- need more design thoughts on how to reinforce the sides of the container so that it doesn’t collapse under the weight of the earth (a civil engineer might be able to help think through the design)

Once the container is up
——-
- custom clearance details for importing computers (Bitcoin mining)

- starlink internet subscription 

- security guard
[4/17/23, 7:47:31 AM] Gary Teh: I will be back in Brazil after I am done with my conference in Germany and one or two meetings in Switzerland 

During this next visit let’s chat more about the implementation details. I believe some gaps will probably surface between now and when I arrive after an initial round of chat with a civil engineer. 🙂

I am already familiar with the mechanical details of setting up the solar panels, also on setting up the Bitcoin mining computers once they arrive on site
[4/17/23, 7:50:15 AM] Gary Teh: What is also unclear at this point still is the custom clearance details for importing the Bitcoin mining machines

https://TrueSight.me/roadmap

A lot of it is heavily dependent on Agroverse generating huge volumes of profits 🤔
[10/29/23, 12:59:40 PM] Gary Teh: *Insights gathered* about SunMint these past few months 

    - there are already lots of people doing off the grid data centers

    - setting an off the grid Bitcoin miner requires a two year payback period 

    - there really is no need for us to be managing our own chain to notarize Agroverse shipment passing through our supply chain as that space is already very crowded 

    - farmers and indigenous people have conflicting interest

*back to basic assumption about the future*

As climate change advances, 

    - surface area of desert will increase due to drought

    - surface area of the ocean will increase due to melting polar ice caps

     - indigenous are most familiar with traditional methods to restore the land 

*new thought direction*

    - what if large plots of waste (desert) land were purchased using surplus profits generated from Agroverse trading and made to remain open access to all and also allowed for management by the native indigenous people?  

    - what would a human colony on international waters look like?

[1/4/24, 11:23:59 AM] Tres Garcia: Sorry… just dropped in out of curiosity and to see how everyone is doing. 

@14153000019 stay far away from all land related to flood zones. It is cheap for a reason. It floods… Desert floods are the worst, as there is little to no warning. Flood zone land may also come with guarantees that you never build on it. 

So look for something close by, but higher up. Will probably only have to spend 25% more

[1/20/24, 2:57:25 AM] Gary Teh: This project has been particularly intriguing amongst friends in Davos as it was immediately labelled as an Elon Musk category project. 

these were the general themes surfaced during discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

A lot is going on in that front.
[2/6/24, 11:58:12 AM] David - California Land Owner Davos: That being said? So many start ups in the space are focused on direct to human consumption. Reasons?

In blind taste tests, crickets beat beef.

Crickets have a better amino/protein/carb mix than beef, by a long shot (really).
[2/6/24, 11:58:52 AM] David - California Land Owner Davos: Problem? American consumers cannot handle insects.

Figure what to grow on the plot of land
[2/6/24, 5:14:00 PM] Gary Teh: The second milestone we should hit before end of this calendar year is to achieve either one of these two conditions 

- mined and sold cryptocurrencies using solar power generated via the off grid facility we have setup on our piece of land 

- ⁠sold and generated fiat cash of something produced using raw materials from our piece of land. Sales should either be direct or via @120363044028036610@g.us Amazon account or Wix account 

Otherwise, I don’t know what this guild has been spending time on the entire year 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

- people will be willing to drive 2.5 hours just to dump off their stuff 
- ⁠goodwill probably doesn’t want to sort out the stuff
- ⁠people want to sell their trailers first cheap. Make sure they deliver instead of you picking it up (e.g. USd250-500)
- ⁠people get to know about her camp because they were visiting East Jesus 
- ⁠people come to the last free place for an experience 
- ⁠folks curious to ask questions about how to live off the grid and even offer tips for advice received

In short concise bullet points, What are the different daily needs areas that we should do further RnD when building an off grid civilization in the arid desert

Some areas that came to mind 

- drinking water generation 
- ⁠energy generation
- ⁠energy storage 
- ⁠food production
[2/18/24, 8:21:29 AM] Meta AI: Great starting points! Here are some additional daily needs areas to consider for further R&D in building an off-grid civilization in the arid desert:

• Shelter and construction materials
• Waste management and recycling
• Clothing and textiles
• Communication and connectivity
• Healthcare and medical resources
• Education and knowledge sharing
• Personal hygiene and sanitation
• Safety and security measures
• Transportation and mobility
• Social and community building
• Psychological well-being and mental health

These areas are crucial for creating a sustainable and self-sufficient community in the desert. By focusing on research and development in these areas, you can ensure that the basic needs of the inhabitants are met, and the community can thrive in the long term. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/18/24, 8:30:12 AM] Anupa/diya: RnD  Food and diet

Please edit to whatever is necessary
[2/18/24, 8:31:28 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful @918017107841! Thank you for offering do online research to find more materials we could use to do RnD on in our off grid facility

[2/18/24, 8:35:00 AM] Anupa/diya: In that case from my experience of publication design. What is the picture will this be for research or is it a coffee table book 

If it's a coffee table book. Photos are the main thing. Photos will are captioned and labelled . 

In india, many wedding companies are getting this community photo accounts where everyone uploads their photos to a common cloud
[2/18/24, 8:37:00 AM] Anupa/diya: This is great research for trekking communities, competitions like Barclays running, or even for music festivals that happen in the deserts or mountains.
[2/18/24, 8:38:06 AM] Anupa/diya: The photographic account can be a project of it's own.
[2/18/24, 8:39:03 AM] Anupa/diya: Please make sure that whatever info is gotten for the book is validated and also the copyright to print
[2/18/24, 9:03:53 AM] Gary Teh: Primarily research books
[2/18/24, 9:05:50 AM] Anupa/diya: In that case, you will be more sure of the authenticity and referencing of the information. Research cataloging is key
[2/18/24, 9:10:42 AM] Gary Teh: Would yoj open to coming up with a system for that?
[2/18/24, 9:22:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I wouldn't be the person. Someone with an editorial background should it. 

I can suggest 
1. Photos .Description and date 
2.  Academic referencing it's the book, author date , year .. I am not sure. There are lot of book generators like world cat.org
[2/18/24, 9:23:22 AM] Anupa/diya: An editor will have to be brought into the picture for structuring and proofing
[2/18/24, 1:23:36 PM] Gary Teh: @41788888581 is a professional writer 🙂🙏

[2/19/24, 6:22:54 PM] Anupa/diya: Will open a resource document. Maybe we can look at notion for all this
[2/19/24, 6:24:28 PM] Gary Teh: Yes and we can then start assembling ideas we want to test for the following area which we can then compile into book
[2/19/24, 9:10:19 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 I am aware that you are proposing a social media strategy 

Could you help us understand in more detail how that strategy you have in mind works and also how it ties in to the larger picture 🙂🙏
[2/19/24, 9:22:51 PM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363045796860099@g.us* 

As linear economy business models progress, climate change intensifies, resulting in expanded desert land and rising sea levels. How can humans adapt to this reality without perpetuating the forces that fueled the change?
[2/19/24, 9:23:11 PM] Gary Teh: After rounds of discussion this seems to be the set of hypothesis that @120363045796860099@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to utilize waste collected from the surrounding area to turn a barren piece of land into a productive one 

- ⁠productivity could be achieved by systematic application of circular economy principles 

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of soil regeneration through the use of waste material (_courtesy of @41765737357_)

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of permaculture techniques used by the indigenous on regenerated soil

- ⁠productivity could be achieved via construction of off grid data center facility where bulk if not all of the materials are scavenged from elsewhere at a fraction of the commercial cost if not for free

- ⁠productivity could be achieved with minimal deployment of fiat resources
[2/19/24, 9:23:27 PM] Anupa/diya: This isn't really a strategy but a series of thoughts which anyone can build 

If there is a purpose of creating a publication on the who how where what why. It might be a good idea to Extention the idea of this kind of lifestyle via social media . 

It started with gary building a portable car shade and I suggested a tiktok preferably page can be done for others to see how easily these hacks can be made.

I have some every nice "interior" spaces of vehicles with such great utilise which can easily build awareness with DIY page

It can be for individuals, festivals companies to showcase their products and advertise and more so to advocate this sustainable and minimal lifestyle can be adopted
[2/19/24, 9:23:57 PM] Anupa/diya: I can actually in to these topics
[2/19/24, 9:25:47 PM] Anupa/diya: They are some very high end brands that are advocating alternative lifestyles to the main stream market. The idea of holidaying in Airbnb has really changed the way people travel rather than staying at hotels
[2/19/24, 9:26:04 PM] Anupa/diya: Maybe one can even build an experience about the lifestyle
[2/19/24, 9:27:04 PM] Anupa/diya: It can be a lifestyle experience that sunmint is promoting on the side or just aim to create an alternative lifestyle
[2/19/24, 9:28:00 PM] Anupa/diya: It also is a decision of the members who live in this kind of lifestyle. Do you want to mainstream it
[2/19/24, 9:28:22 PM] Anupa/diya: Like burning man has become lifestyle experience now for the 3 months

They were in the middle of clearing storage pallets to the dumpster just nearby 

Pallet material is easy to acquire. Shops will be happy to give them away for free so that they don’t need to pay someone to take them

- ⁠figure out what type of specialists they will need access to to be able to cultivate the cacao

[7/15/24, 6:42:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: São Gonçalo.
[7/15/24, 6:42:43 AM] Gary Teh: That is the name of the city?
[7/15/24, 6:44:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: yes
[7/15/24, 6:44:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Father's Suni father is the closest land.
[7/15/24, 6:45:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 200 km walk through a bridge.
[7/15/24, 6:45:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Vanderlan (around 30 min by motocycle), Suni's land.
[7/15/24, 6:47:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Her family is the leadership family = taking decisions family.
[7/15/24, 6:47:36 AM] Emelin - Bahia: All these lands she mentioned are kukama.
[7/15/24, 6:49:53 AM] Gary Teh: Are you able to find the city on Google maps? I couldnt seem to be able to find it.
[7/15/24, 6:50:02 AM] Gary Teh: Same with this location on Google maps
[7/15/24, 6:50:50 AM] Gary Teh: How much time have you spent so far liaising with Suni? Respond to this text so that when we process the tokenization it will get picked up by the AI. 🤩🙏
[7/15/24, 7:06:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 09:47 until 11:02. I updated her about the important points on the process as having someone to report to you directly or me on how the cultivation was going, the importance to contact people who understand about the legal process of indigenous communities when they are not demarcated by the government yet (I delivered her the responsibility to get in touch with the authorities and ask about it, remarking upon how important this is for us to start even planning). I also mentioned we would start just with one community and see how it goes. She was imagining two or more but we settled for one.
[7/15/24, 7:06:54 AM] Emelin - Bahia: She is also responsible for giving me the exact distance among these 3 lands from the city of São Gonçalo.
[7/15/24, 7:07:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: She asked for us to see the land but I do think it is important to gather all the info before we travel and see it.

[7/15/24, 7:08:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: so I will focus on gathering all info first.
[7/15/24, 7:12:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Gathering the right distance. 2. Checking legally. 3.Checking with Embrapa if they work with training and cocoa plants as the community has no knowledge in growing then yet.  4. Check the costs of implementing machines so they can do the nibs or checking if there is a place where they can get the nibs. 5. Checking prices. 6. 4.Suni talks with her father and her family about the project. 7. Travelling and talking in person with the leadership/owner of the land.
[7/15/24, 7:12:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What do you think?
[7/15/24, 7:14:02 AM] Gary Teh: We don’t need them to implement the machines for processing into cacao nibs 

Just fermenting and sun drying the almonds
[7/15/24, 7:14:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: They have forest (perfect for cabruca) and lands with open spaces. Everything points to Suni's father land.
[7/15/24, 7:14:54 AM] Gary Teh: Also ask Embrapa about carbon credits
[7/15/24, 7:15:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: yes, it is included.
[7/15/24, 7:15:21 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So I'll hold a little bit until she gives me more information and then, talk to Empraba.
[7/15/24, 7:15:50 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because once we go there, if we skip the machinery as they don't need, we need to go with someone from Embrapa.
[7/15/24, 7:16:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So they also can see the 3 lands.
[7/15/24, 7:16:33 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Before going there, I can ask about the growth time
[7/15/24, 7:16:49 AM] Emelin - Bahia: if they know the process of making them to grow faster.
[7/15/24, 7:16:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The last thing, we travel.
[7/15/24, 7:18:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Still, they will need a structure to dry the seeds and do the process of fermentation. It is material, maybe it needs to be built, so we should include it. Even if the costs are small, yet, we should include.

[7/15/24, 8:39:22 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I mean, they can take the plants, produce and sell for other people, let's imagine they refuse to sell to Agroverse for example. What conditions will be discussed?
[7/15/24, 8:39:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Can they sell to others, will they sell to agroverse to at least 5 years after the project's implementation?

[7/17/24, 12:03:25 PM] Emelin - Bahia: At least to know if it is possible.
[7/17/24, 12:04:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The idea here is to have the education first, showing how to take care of the seedlings (it would be interesting if they can be together with the planting because they (the community people) don't have knowledge on cabruca.
[7/17/24, 12:06:21 PM] Gary Teh: Shall I invite Paulo into this channel?
[7/17/24, 12:07:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Having Suni as responsible and being there, she can give support informing the situation and if something comes up, we need to know how much they charge per visit (or if they wouldn't charge and would like to be partners)
[7/17/24, 12:07:39 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Maybe another one. Here I'm adding info that is between you, me and Suni.
[7/17/24, 12:07:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: As well.

How much they charge for visits to follow the process in the first months, how many visits would be necessary (so we know maximum/minimum) after the planting. 4. If they work with partnership due to the fact that is an indigenous land.

Seems everything is falling into place  🤩🙏
[7/17/24, 7:22:48 PM] Gary Teh: *Key Takeaways on what was discussed with Karen Hardy*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface…
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Aggrieves is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit.
[7/18/24, 4:29:35 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Good morning. Feedback on Paulo's indication. His friend, João, send me an audio saying he is still in college (to say he doesn't have the required knowledge yet, that Paulo must have jumped to conclusions about him. He also said he is busy and his agenda is tight here in Ilhéus.
[7/18/24, 4:33:03 AM] Emelin - Bahia: These ones sound like bad planning. That is why I believe that giving time to plan something is not wasted time.   - Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give.

*Subject matter 1: taking into account invisible work that is often performed by women folk* that is not accounted for in the economy which prevents them from fully contributing into the tokenized part of the economy 

- childcare

*Subject matter 2: Problem of ethics when interfacing with the Indigenous community* 

- ⁠when interfacing with the indigenous community in @120363045796860099@g.us ensure we do not inadvertently steer them in a direction that cause them to change the fauna on the tribal land and introduce imbalance ‎<This message was edited>
