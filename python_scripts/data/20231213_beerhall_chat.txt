[11/8/23, 10:05:31 AM] Val Lapidus: This is one of those things where it's going to get lost in the shuffle.  But we really need this. This is why slack is a much better way to do these types of communications right now. This requires that somebody memorizes that this contact and thread exists

[11/8/23, 10:51:55 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has recently exercised her *autonomy* to create a new Wix based website for our main community site at TrueSight.me as Shadi has been busy with work and couldn’t find time to continue building out the Wordpress based community site 

I think her efforts at exercising her *autonomy* to creatively solve a problem was commendable 🙂🙏
[8/8/23, 4:55:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Much like in the Mayans skimping on quality and mixing orgin beans with sad beans was a thing
[11/8/23, 10:53:27 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, more of these *autonomous* actions are beneficial for our DAO and also encourages *Diversity* within our ecosystem 

*Diversity* is one of our core values
[8/8/23, 4:55:55 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is your favorite

[8/8/23, 5:00:31 PM] Gary Teh: I might be biased but it still default to our Brazilian cacao nibs
I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

Makes total sense everytime we call an hour meetup where we have a whole bunch of attendees with no clear relationship as why they are attending and how the presence is related to the agenda, we are wasting 100 governance tokens from our very limited supply for each person per hour.
[11/8/23, 9:03:58 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform 

What a match made in heaven!! 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[8/10/23, 10:44:46 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding our SunMint project Allison mentioned she will start looking into implementing solid state servers with zero moving parts. The challenge for her would be to keep the cost under USD1000

Those servers should theoretically run forever when deployed on the farmers’ premises 

Since we are considering the use of Proof of Authority for TrueChain, they should not cause too much heat generation 

Was chatting this afternoon with @16468233438 about running some stand-alone nodes using solar panels out of his storage shed, just for experimentation sake… actually more for the fun of it 🤣

[8/10/23, 11:29:02 PM] Gary Teh: interesting how Jerry immediately homed in on the zero accountability characteristic that’s been baked right into the DNA of the DAO that Cindy (whom you introduced last year) pointed out when she was looking into our structure last year which from her perspective is disconcerting to traditional investors
[11/9/23, 10:50:24 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s get his and Micheal’s feedback 

If they feel receptive enough about it then we can trail tested it
[8/10/23, 11:35:59 PM] Gary Teh: After Jerry left for home, me and Allison stuck around for a short bit where we chat about our tendency to keep injecting entropy into the system whenever we observe it on the cusp of achieving some form of equilibrium. Basically a dissipative structure 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system
[11/9/23, 10:58:56 PM] Gary Teh: I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

Just some random ideas to popped into my mind just now 🤷‍♂️🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 11:38:48 PM] Gary Teh: Jerry was joking about the human mechanical Turk where AI defines the strategy and humans perform the offline action 

Taking a step back and looking at where we are heading it does feel like our DAO is slowly headed in that general direction with the introduction of ChatGpt as the unofficial member which gets utilized a lot in the background

[8/12/23, 12:07:40 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: does Edgar agree. Does it reflect the truth, or are the reports being exaggerated just to provide entertainment for the Western world and distract them from their own problems?
[11/10/23, 1:19:56 AM] Gary Teh: They probably thought the rules that were voted into our constitution/white paper did not apply to them or thought they could probably get away with breaking rules once these have been voted into place 

Or they came into the ecosystem before those ruled were put in place and did not bother to keep abreast of rule changes that have been voted into effect 

The folks that stuck around modified their behavior to fit the rules once informed 

Those that left because they suddenly realized there was no more value to be derived and there was nothing they want to contribute in the first place. They were just in here for sales lead generation to power their own business models. 

They opted to leave. Though we do have a three strikes and you are out policy. They did not even get to strike 2 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 1:25:26 AM] Gary Teh: You were not being kicked out but rotated out 

The guild have a different set of rules that were voted in  

A maximum capacity of 8

When a new active members need to join, the least active is invited out 

All the other seven were active on some ongoing tasks ‎<This message was edited>

[8/12/23, 11:01:21 PM] Gary Teh: It is a recurring pattern I observe that whenever a person is attempting to profit from information arbitrage, he/she will exhibit very cagey behavioral patterns. 

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space. Based on what I have heard so far via the extended network, depending on where we attempt to bring this disruption to (especially in areas where cartels are in control), some of us might even encounter assassination attempts. Sounds exciting... 🤔

[11/10/23, 1:33:56 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. @557391090002 was recently invited out because when we did an audit amongst ourselves he had no active scope 

Happy to introduce 1 more guild member who can commit time on a weekly basis in there.  

I know @972543523823 would be the 8th person but @31641075825 basically interfaces all the communications for her and she rarely goes into group chats

I am aware Emelin is trying to onboard a new designer she can work directly with. Not sure if that 8th should be used for him since feels like Emelin will be interfacing with the new designer if he wants to join 

But otherwise from what I am aware of so far we need these two additional roles

_Role 1_
a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

_PS: Also please don’t self define a role of being a manager to oversee other members._

[8/12/23, 11:21:33 PM] Gary Teh: I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

[11/13/23, 12:02:04 AM] Gary Teh: *Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/13/23, 12:12:18 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of brutal, Open Sea just laid off 50% of their employees 2 days ago.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-staff-severance-version-2-0-launch

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.

[11/14/23, 12:20:15 PM] Gary Teh: Additional insights from Ray Wu (Y-Combinator Alumni) 

*key insights*
    - tech scene is so abysmal right now no one wants to think about it that is why a lot of tech folks are looking into the FnB space 

    - VCs don’t really do much except _sell the money_ they took from someone else (_Limited Partners_) for hopefully at least a 3X return to keep their job. They market themselves as _value adding_ to try sell their money at a premium to unsuspecting founders but actually not much value add in hindsight

- people come in at seed and pre-seed with the belief in the _greater fool theory_ that someone will buy out their position at Series A for a 3X return. 

- bulk of the rich folks belong to the NATO category by default (_no action talk only_). See them for what they are. Tap on their network of relationships if applicable otherwise be judicious in deployment of operator’s (_person who actually executes_) time beyond what is necessary to maintain the relationship ‎<This message was edited>

[11/18/23, 7:24:32 PM] Vibhu Mittal: Tokens for farmers are an interesting form of liquidity and profit sharing while aligning people in the same direction.
[11/18/23, 9:08:23 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that the cooperative we are working with in Brazil have been actively exploring this concept with a supposed tech solutions provider while I was there

Unfortunately based on what I understood later on, the tech solutions provider ghosted on them... (_ghosting seem to be a prevalent phenomena in the web3 space… I had even offered to meetup with the tech solutions provider to explore collaborate while I was there… but to no avail…_) 

The upside is, once we have proven the end to end model for Agroverse that door is right now left wide open for us to step right in to fill up that gaping hole left by the tech solutions provider. 

According to our new _4 rules rubric system_ we should in principle award governance token to the tech solutions provider that ghosted on the cooperative. 

This is because he did spend time educating the market on our behalf… he just did not deliver on his promise… 🤔🤣

[11/21/23, 3:35:42 PM] Val Lapidus: So that if someone wants to go outside the DAO and purchase they need to find a way to create the relationship
[11/21/23, 3:37:03 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s play the devils advocate.

Supposed we have you (a DAO member) introduced to the coop and you have visited the coop, you right now have the relationship 

Why would you not want to go renegade but instead want to continue incurring the overhead that the DAO charges on each transaction 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/23, 3:38:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Because I believe in the DAO.  People who manage the relationship with the co-op need to be trusted members of the dao
[11/21/23, 3:39:36 PM] Gary Teh: So basically DAO members helping maintain the relationship with the coops need to strongly align with the core values, purpose and mission of the DAO? 

Fair enough 

We need to really filter for these qualities during new DAO member interviews ‎<This message was edited>

[11/26/23, 3:42:18 PM] Gary Teh: Something I observed about the way work is structured around these work session teams at the Zen monastery I have been studying these past few days

*_simplicity*_
The task at each position is simple and well defined. Which allows easy build up of muscle memory after 3-4 iteration by a person executing that the role

Also the number of roles are very very limited since the overall scope of operations was deliberately kept to a minimal as is the signature characteristic of Zen inspired designs 

*_ease of role switching*_
Since these roles are designed to be simple, anyone could easily swap in and swap out of those roles (_which happens on a weekly basis_). 

This also makes it possible for a guest student who has just joined the community for a 2 week period to quickly get into the hang of any assigned role after 2-3 days and start being productive by day 4

*_pairing*_
Someone more experienced in a role is paired with someone new to a role. 

I have observed similar process before in engineering teams called _pair programming_ where an engineer more experienced with a codebase is paired up with an incoming engineer that is new to the codebase to quickly onboard the new engineer 

*_redundancy*_
There is a healthy level of redundancy built into the system design. 

7-8 people are loaded into a scope that could be easily handled by 3-4 people ‎<This message was edited>

Well worth reading for any one, especially for those interested in how good planning  and user experience can result in a better product, even when the ‘product’ is something of the scale of Changi airport or the port of Singapore.

[11/26/23, 9:12:22 PM] Gary Teh: Well.. seems it’s less intense here than the *_Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat_* which clocks *_10 hours per day*_. 🤣

Based data collected from the past seven days, it is an average of only 5 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day. Plus another 5 hours of meditation while actively attending to simple chores around the temple and the farm.

One thing I am really curious would be to volunteer as a server for one of the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat once I get back to the Bay Area again after my upcoming trip to Davos. 

That will help give first hand knowledge on how the logistic side of Vipassana retreat works (_heard from @14153096839 that no one is allowed to talk there even as a server_) 

And then as a third data point, finally attend the workshop conducted at the Spiritual Science Research Foundation in Goa as recommended by @41765663130 

My hypothesis is in-depth _*qualitative analysis_* of three such system should help provide enough data points to help triangulate at a high level the key components needed for a volunteer based self managing and self sustaining organization. 🤔
[11/26/23, 9:13:31 PM] Gary Teh: With a *in-depth qualitative analysis* of seven such systems, the clusters (_key patterns_) should become very very apparent 🤩

[11/28/23, 12:42:32 PM] Gary Teh: Another local distributor she proposed to reach out to 

https://veritablevegetable.com/grower/

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

*Time taken: 1 hour*
[11/29/23, 4:49:43 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 and @31641075825 both of you should probably arrange time to do FaceTime and get to know each other 

This is especially both of you will be very heavily involved on the European side of the supply chain as well as Swiss association matters 

@31641075825 I am asking @41799155602 if the three of us could meet up at his place after me and @41799155602 finished visiting WEF in Jan 

That way we could really discuss about next steps for Europe

[12/2/23, 7:57:07 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 

@19209806391 will be visiting Kenya this year 

During this visit it is important that he be provided samples of macadamia nuts from your farm that he can bring back to USA for testing with the buyers in his network based in Wisconsin and then some for the network based in San Francisco 

If USA market is receptive and there is sufficient profit margin that makes it commercially viable for DAO to bring into USA via Agroverse infrastructure, I will pay a visit to your farm to certify it for imports into USA under USA government FDA regulation 🙂🙏

Meanwhile, while waiting for @19209806391 arrive please sort out the following 

   - export permits from Kenya government to leave port

    - source for freighting company that can handle the exporting ‎<This message was edited>

[12/2/23, 8:02:07 AM] Gary Teh: @19209806391 please follow up 🙂🙏

@19209806391 once you have the samples from @254700187599 and have arrived back in USA please have some of the samples shipped to @16468233438  in San Francisco 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 8:03:35 AM] Gary Teh: Part of the documentation for getting FDA certified requires that you list the all the steps from harvest to packing before shipping out to USA 

If you can get that ready prior to my arrival in Kenya to your farm that will greatly facilitate the process 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 8:04:06 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Will do 😊
[12/2/23, 8:09:29 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I will prepare a research document on macadamia and share too.

_The 4 rules_
    - 100 TDG: per hour 
    - 1 TDG: per USD
    - hours contributed based on self reporting
    - USD contributed, please submit receipt ‎<This message was edited>

[12/7/23, 12:39:39 PM] Gary Teh: *_Observation at the Zen monastery*_

I had the opportunity to study how the *_sangha*_ (_monastic community_) works 

Specific forms occur at recurring specific time of the day, these are those:

    - communal food
    - study time 
    - meditation time 
    - housekeeping time 
    - operating chores 

The only thing that is compulsory for all to engage in is housekeeping 

As for the rest whether the residents all turn up for them it is up to the exercise of their *_autonomy*_

For residents who are keen the schedule is visibly displayed on the way 

I noticed not all monastic residents show all the time for all meditation or study sessions

But since all residents were self selecting they are generally motivated to follow the schedule which is designed to enhance their spiritual practice 

_*How that translates to DAO*_
Feel free to come up with a schedule and a meeting venue 

If DAO members are keen they can turn up 

If DAO members are not keen they don’t need to turn up 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/7/23, 1:44:49 PM] Anupa/diya: Given the fact that everyone is professionally engaged with other things, some kind of dedication and commitment needs to be there to respect people s time. That's a part of integrity.

[12/7/23, 3:45:28 PM] Gary Teh: I am exercising my *Autonomy* by minimizing my FaceTime for now

When I look at my personal historical data collected over the past 12 months, these FaceTime sessions somehow always occur right when US stock market starts trading. 

The personal cost (_disrupted trades amounting to more than USD20K_) of these FaceTime far outweighs the value generated so far 🤔

I conclude asynchronous communication works best for me. 

Also asynchronous communications allows the space for the messenger to deliver the full message and then ample time for me to fully read and contemplate on the message before replying

Finally side observation these past three weeks, when I deliberately step back, it creates the space that allows other DAO members to step forward. I observed this too as a common practice here in the sangha ‎<This message was edited>
[12/8/23, 4:51:58 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 I have given some more thoughts on personal resource allocation, since you are there covering India there is really no strong compelling reason to be there for @120363044028036610@g.us purpose 

I will more likely than not take a rain check on India for now  

What is more valuable would be to head to areas where there are no DAO member coverage yet and attempt some evangelism work there 🤩🙏
[12/8/23, 5:14:40 AM] Anupa/diya: That's fine. I don't see any pressing need. I am just collecting resources for anyone who wants to take the sale lead forward

[12/9/23, 5:36:51 AM] Gary Teh: The key characteristics of *_compassion*_ is the person who is triggered to action must also have had suffered in the same way as the other that is being observed. 

It is thus not *_sympathy*_ but *_empathy*_ 

*_Sympathy*_: I have never experienced your type of suffering. I don’t really feel how you are feeling. I am just doing a donation right now just to feel good about myself. 

*_Empathy*_: I have been through that same type of suffering and I know how painful it is. I can feel it right now myself just by seeing your suffering. I am naturally triggered to stop the pain. 

You are experiencing the physical pain. We are both experiencing the psychology pain.

In hindsight, the _*10 day silent mediation retreat*_ was a training module on the *_practical side*_ to observe how the mind body phenomena works 

Whereas, the *_21 day zen training*_ was a training module on the *_theory side*_ to understand why i observed what was observed during the practical lesson ‎<This message was edited>

Sattva = Warrior

@436608133615 these might be elements that you want to consider to incorporate for your *_encrypted gods*_ game design as well

Rather than attempt to sell it perhaps just order as much as possible and then store them somewhere in our decentralized warehousing facility  

Buyers will come knocking on the door at some point when they realize our prices have became competitive just because of market price changes

Then we can start offloading the cacao from our network of warehouses

DAO members get compensated for storage 

Based on my understanding from the folks from the cooperative, Cacao butter can technically be store forever 

Also an active sales team is no longer needed. We just need yo find more folks who are keen to offer their place for cacao storage purposes ‎<This message was edited>

_So long as no attempt is made to pursue any commercial enterprises, there is technically no need to maintain the tokens if everything is gift and donation based._

[12/12/23, 10:14:47 AM] Gary Teh: Yes

We will be seeking to meet channel partners there

That is how Tiffany Kelly (member of House of Balance) from Beyond Bamboo found partners for her company’s products ‎<This message was edited>
[12/12/23, 10:35:25 AM] Gary Teh: DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them.

[12/12/23, 11:58:36 AM] Gary Teh: My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 12:16:56 PM] Dan: Gm gm - I believe there was a lawyer here that’s worked in the DAO space. Would love to connect about developing a legal structure for a DAO I’m coordinating
[12/12/23, 2:42:29 PM] Gary Teh: Negative statements are more *qualifiers* than they are *action rules*. 


_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples 


_scenario with qualifer and actual action associated_

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree. 

- *key action*: gather apples from apple trees in garden 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck the blue apples ‎<This message was edited>
