@14153000019 stay far away from all land related to flood zones. It is cheap for a reason. It floods… Desert floods are the worst, as there is little to no warning. Flood zone land may also come with guarantees that you never build on it.

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening
