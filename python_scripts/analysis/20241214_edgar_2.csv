Careful examination of headlines coming out of Gaza shows that Gaza is still happening

Gary Teh,,"@13135550002 what is the potential impact on price of oil if conflict between isreal and hamas expands beyond just Gaza and Lebanon? 

What are key redlines to watch out for in this conflict?",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort,0.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded,0.00,20240922
Meta AI,,"The potential impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on oil prices depends on various factors, including:

1. Escalation and geographical spread: Conflict expansion beyond Gaza and Lebanon could disrupt oil production and transportation in the region.

2. Regional involvement: Involvement from countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Egypt could significantly impact oil production and prices.

3. Strait of Hormuz: Conflict spreading to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, could severely disrupt global oil supplies.

4. Global economic conditions: Oil price impact will also depend on existing global economic conditions and oil demand.

Key redlines to watch:

1. Attacks on oil infrastructure or shipping lanes.

2. Involvement of other regional countries.

3. Israeli strikes on Iranian territory.

4. Hamas attacks on Israeli cities or critical infrastructure.

Please note that predicting oil price fluctuations and conflict escalation is inherently uncertain. These factors are constantly evolving.

Gary Teh,,"@13135550002 seems the two conflicts are really proxy war between isreal and Iran 

What is the likelihood of a head on conflict between isreal and Iran given the escalating proxy war between these two countries",Unknown,0.00,,0.00,20240922
Meta AI,,"The Israel-Iran proxy war is a complex and sensitive issue. Assessing the likelihood of a direct conflict between Israel and Iran requires considering various factors:

*Factors increasing the likelihood:*

1. Escalating proxy wars: Intensifying conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq increase tensions.

2. Iranian nuclear program: Israel's concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and potential breakout capacity.

3. Border incidents: Skirmishes along Israel's northern border with Syria and Lebanon.

4. Naval confrontations: Confrontations between Israeli and Iranian naval forces in the Red Sea and Strait of Hormuz.

5. US-Iran relations: Tensions between the US and Iran, particularly regarding the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).

*Factors reducing the likelihood:*

1. Mutual deterrence: Both sides understand the devastating consequences of a direct conflict.

2. Economic considerations: Iran's struggling economy and Israel's reliance on international trade.

3. Russian and Chinese influence: Both countries have interests in regional stability.

4. Diplomatic efforts: Ongoing attempts at dialogue, such as the Baghdad Conference.

*Likelihood assessment:*

- Direct conflict in the short term (6-12 months): Low to moderate (20-40%)
- Increased proxy wars and skirmishes: High (60-80%)
- Continued tensions and low-level conflicts: Very high (80-90%)

*Redlines to watch:*

1. Iranian nuclear advancements.

2. Major Israeli strikes on Iranian soil.

3. Significant Iranian-backed attacks on Israeli cities.

4. US or Russian intervention.

5. Miscalculations or unintended escalations.

Keep in mind that conflict dynamics are inherently unpredictable. These assessments are based on current information and may change.

Gary Teh,,"LLM category AIs derive their outputs probabilistically as opposed to deterministically. Requiring that they do very *_specific step function Big Data computation*_ seems to yield results where more is to be desired 

From my perspective this is the technology and market gap where smaller companies with less resources can step in to fill up the gap with the deployment of LLMs in a very specific order tuned to very specific industrial needs 

It is an angle where larger technology companies with more resources going after the more generalized use case cannot cater to. hopefully by doing so these smaller companies can *_turn a profit*_ <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort,0.17,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded,0.17,20241001
