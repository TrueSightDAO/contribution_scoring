I was chatting with Youna this morning that after looking at my personal historical performance records there is really only one or two trades that made the bulk of my returns every year 

The rest of the trades might as well have happened in the @120363044542957540@g.us

This investment pattern is really starting to resemble the VC investment approach. Research 1000 companies and only invest in 2 every year

I think the call from her was very timely too. Almost like another signal from the universe 

Another advise from her was to step aside from the DAO. I was thinking through it just now during my drive south, it makes total sense. 

The DAO is going  to go through a phase centralization right now. The right profile to be leading it should be someone who has the following energetic qualities in his/her Bazi

- ⁠1X 梟印 - diminished authority

*Analysis*
- you will make a lot more money holding a full time job or undertaking operational duties of any sort. But It is going to be a frustrating endeavor 4X 正财, 3X伤官 versus 2X 正官 

- ⁠however even if you tried, you will not be granted any autonomy or authority to make any important decisions on behalf of the organization. You will end up experiencing more frustration. 梟印

- ⁠don’t share too much about your money making strategies, your wealth will for sure get robbed 劫财

- ⁠you have some drive but not a lot, try to automate as much as possible your professional efforts otherwise you will run out of steam eventually 七杀

Gary Teh,,"My journey started in 2010. 

The insurance agent whom my dad bought a policy for me from came to visit one day and asked if I wanted to continue it now that I was generating my own income from doing consulting

The implication was I will need to start paying the monthly instead of my dad.

I did not personally belief in the concept of insurance and still don’t today. I strongly believe as in the tradition of Socrates and Seneca, if the body is to fail to such an extend it can no longer function properly, the best antidote is a bullet through the head to immediately end unnecessary continued suffering 

Also I do not belief in the concept of retirement where you work very hard to save a lot so that you can pay USD5000 per month to a nursing home when you grow old so that they could provide personal care giving to you till you die 

_Gentle Reminder: this is my personal beliefs, it is not stated for the purpose of converting you to my belief system. And neither should you seek to convert someone else to your own personal belief system._

_during discussions within this channel be *self focused* and also respect other people’s autonomy_

_if anything, this statement should help shed some light in why a person would seek to manage his money the way he does_

All that said, I ended up cashing out USD50k after canceling the insurance policy my dad had painstakingly build up over 24 years. I observed he felt disappointed with my decision 

First thing he did after I cashed out was his advice that the money not be just kept in my bank account as it is considered *dead money*. 

Rather it be deployed to investments. He recommended that the money be invested to this one company that he has been watching. I handed him USD2000 for management. 

He mentioned it is such a small amount but proceeded to anyways 

USD2000 became USD1000 per quickly 🤣

That was when I realized I couldn’t really trust him with my money. That was when I started buying books about investing. Fortunately my background in accounting was helpful

However considering my total networth now to my total networth back then, I don’t really consider myself to be much of a success financial investing wise. The cash level is almost exactly the same amount after 15 years. 

The primary difference is I got to really taste a lot of life in between now and then. Autonomy above all else. 🤩

I am still puzzled why external observers just keep considering me to be a rich person that can invest in their project? 🤔

The reason why I can do what I do is because I made very very deliberate trade offs money wise. 

I deliberately choose to be homeless

the amount of cash I provide my daughter with every month is way less than what my ex-girlfriend and her parents provides. 

She too was operating under the same mistaken belief despite ample warning from me prior to her getting pregnant. 

Seems she finally came to her senses after the financial models came into effect post pregnancy.

Last time we met she mentioned that she is always short on cash at the end of every month and can’t even afford rent a place for herself. 

Part of the reason why she is staying with her parents which is blessing in disguise. Since you now have three adults taking care of a child instead of two had she stuck around in Bay Area <This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,, 0,20231221

Since the number of participants in this channel is small, we have the opportunity to go really deep into any investment related subject once we discover ones that we all have a common interest in 

Then perhaps after that occurs, we can then source for tools to facilitate to further deepen our exploration in our organically discovered common topic of interest <This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,, 0,20231222

How did it felt like when you experienced your very first substantial monetary loss through your investment activities?",Unknown, 0,, 0,20231228
Edgar,,You pinned a message,Unknown, 0,, 0,20231228
Gary Teh,,"The first time I experienced my major set back was during the 2015 oil crisis 

I had saved up a substantial amount of cash (_more than USD100K_) from the salary paid out while I was working as an engineer 

I had it sitting around in the bank not sure what to do with it. And cash just kept on piling up every month 

Ex-colleagues advised to just put it in alibaba when he realized how much cash I had piled up idle 

Not having much conviction I just parked it all in BABA at USD90. Unfortunately it tanked to USD80 and I exited with a 10% capital loss 🤣

That was when I created the first draft of Edgar and identified a few companies with high dividend payout ratios. A bunch of them were MLP (_master limited partnerships_) in the oil industry as well as Mortgage REITs

I spent time doing my research and then move the bulk of my capital over to Breitburn MLP 

Unfortunately the timing was bad. Saudi Arabia decided to flood the oil market to kill off the entire booming shale oil industry in the U.S. 

Breitburn had too much leverage and went bankrupt. I stumbled into a typical value trap. I saw my entire position wiped out within two months 😱

The typical sensation was dread and interspersed mixed with feelings of hope as and when share prices recovered 

I further employed dollar cost averaging on this position for an additional 3 months. Totally lost amount to USD130K 🤦♂️

And then figured I should just throw in the towel and stop the dollar cost averaging tactic chasing bad money with good money 

At the same time, it was year holidays, I was on a road trip vacation from SF to yellow stone park. What was supposed to be an enjoyable distraction from the financial losses just turned into a very horrible experience. 

I was in a romantic relationship then. And my ex was along with me for the road trip 

somehow for unknown reasons, through the bulk of my adult life, perfectly happy being single and without deliberately trying to get involved with anyone, very high maintenance womenfolk tend to gravitate towards me. My ex during that trip was one of them. Working as a software engineer and being perceived as a cash cow by default probably didn’t help with the problem too 🤔

Here I was just trying to avoid having the bank account balance hit zero and there she was bumping up the expense level because of the general material needs associated with high maintenance profile. She will end up blowing up in anger when her material expectations are not met. It was really really stressful.  🤣

*PS: lessons learned*
 
- best to be single if you are going to be adventurous with your money. Somehow relationship partners will always want a say in how you throw your cash around even though the cash is not technically theirs

- ⁠don’t get involved with high maintenance partners or partners who are going to be relying on you financially if you plan to be financially adventurous (_one of the nomads was exclaiming loudly around the campfire during Xmas why I was still single despite having such an impressive blah blah blah credentials... which I tried to keep under wraps but it somehow leaked thanks to some other nosy dude who went and check my profile online for god knows why... 🤦♂️ ... my response to her... “I am autistic”,  smiled showed her the peace sign and then walked away to go clean the dirty dishes for the camp 🤣_)

- ⁠cut losses early 

- ⁠stop believing in narratives once its been invalidated to avoid the value trap

- ⁠don’t blindly follow dollar averaging strategy

- ⁠what is labeled as stress is a set of physical sensation that will soon pass. <This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,, 0,20231228

- human behavior is hard to acquire

- ⁠human behavior once acquired is hard to drop

- ⁠network effects is self reinforcing human behavior that has gained mass adoption 

- ⁠as a financial analyst, network effects is very hard to financially model. Hence most of these financial models are generally inaccurate  

- ⁠market sentiment tends to severely underprice business models with very strong inherent network effects during extended periods of bad news cycles 

- ⁠severe market mispricing tend to occur at least once or twice a year across an entire bundle of network effects based business models

- ⁠with a relatively modest sum of capital and with extreme levels of operating overheads management, one could technically arbitrage on each wave of mispricing to cover all ongoing expenses <This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 3.67,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 3.67,20240111
