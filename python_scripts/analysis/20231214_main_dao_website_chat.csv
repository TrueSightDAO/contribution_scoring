Gary Teh,"Trying to pull the WhatsApp messages via API to auto award governance tokens.

Nothing to do with what you are doing immediately right now. But way down the road, if this infrastructure works users should be able to see how their governance tokens were automatically awarded to them. 

Right now the awarding is a manual process. ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 0,20231110

Shadi Atamne,"So my biggest question is, how do you want to handle the form submissions?",Contributed Human Effort, 1,20231110
Shadi Atamne,"For the governance token part that you want to achieve, the form submissions need to also create users",Contributed Human Effort, 0,20231110
Gary Teh,"That is true. 
For the awarding of governance tokens parts. Too much details to actually go into right now. 
I will come up with some specifications once we figured out that the tech part actually works.

Key requirements for the automation of this is that existing DAO members active in our WhatsApp channels do not need to adopt any form of new behavior ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 0,20231110

Gary Teh,"The vision would that it eventually tracks across our group members activities on Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram and Discord and automatically awards them with governance tokens whenever they do something that contributes to any of our projects

That way, members Do Nothing different than what they are already doing but get ever more governance tokens and voting rights in our DAO as they carry out their normal course of activities in their daily life

And then way way later on these records notarized on our own chain ran on nodes in the SunMint cluster ran in the facilities provided by our DAO members

You see how I am gradually stitching all these different components in our Eco-System together 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231110
