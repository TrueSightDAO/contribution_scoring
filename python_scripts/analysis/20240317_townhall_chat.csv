_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to more care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

Jake (_DAO governor_) is right in the heart of two very large multi-level marketing networks. 

Senior multi-level marketing associates will not lift a finger to support the current model (_influencer marketing_) because they know their pay back will be just a fraction of what they will get when the MLM model is in place

[3/10/24, 7:13:14 AM] Gary Teh: Once either the *_TikTok retail customer acquisition strategy_* or the *_chocolatier customer acquisition strategy*_ has been validated and proven to be viable, it makes sense to raise capital to scale them

Capital will be deployed for the purpose of accelerating the rate of market saturation within the USA market. Our estimates for the Total Addressable Market size (_TAM_) becomes important to provide visibility on how big the pie is going to be 

Capital will be raised via private sales of tokens to accredited investors using SAFT. That way, we do not get on the wrong side of SEC regulation

_PS: this is where a lot of founders who pitch me their project for fundraising purposes gets it wrong and totally mess up the pitch._

_*Investors do not invest money so that founders can pay their bills and live comfortably*_
