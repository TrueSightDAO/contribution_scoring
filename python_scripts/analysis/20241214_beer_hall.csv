Emelin - Bahia,,"I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.",Unknown,0,,0,20240912

Gary Teh,,"I Spent another 30 minutes thinking through another alternative solution to this dispute that @41799155602 has surfaced for AGL2

The alternative is to ship the entire balance inventory over to @41765663130 place so that it could be offloaded one way or the other during the upcoming WEF over at @41786813052 place over at the cultural platz. 

That way @41799155602 also gets the opportunity to help with the sales and distribution of the remaining AGL2 inventory during the WEF period

As for the remaining unsold balance, @41799155602 will get the opportunity to choose between

- donating it all away

- ‚Å†bring it back to his place and continue with sales and marketing effort in Switzerland 

- ‚Å†withdraw it from AGL2 contract for his personal consumption 

This provides an effective avenue for him to channel his energy positively towards progress as opposed to being simply stuck with just expressing his verbal displeasure with the lack of progress with the sales and marketing of AGL2 inventory 

Either way, we will close out AGL2 after the last day of WEF 2025, tabulate the gains/losses and do distribute the spoils in accordance with the clauses defined therein üôÇüôè",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort,50.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded,50.00,20240914

Gary Teh,,"Pertaining to this dispute that was recently surfaced by @41799155602 where he argued that the balance inventory in AGL2 has already been sold off and AGL2 contract should be deemed completed and the accumulated fiat funds distributed when we received down payment of USD$1500 from Shena for 300kg of organic cacao nibs. 

When examined under GAAP (generally accepted account practice), the default accounting standard followed by USA jurisdiction which TrueTech Inc is incorporated under, that is clearly not the case 

*GAAP on revenue recognition*
Shena has provided down payment of USD$1500 for 300kg of organic cacao nibs from Bazil. Until, Shena has signed the purchase agreement sent to her and 300kg of organic cacao nibs is in her possession, the USD$1500 is to be treated as liability to creditor as opposed to revenue that has been earned.

When we examine the AGL2 ledger, it should be noted that the remaining balance of our cacao nibs has already been bagged into 8 ounce kraft pouches. Whereas Shena the buyer, has placed an order for 300kg of loosen unpackaged cacao nibs.

https://agroverse.shop/agl2

*On preserving on the bottom line*
One can counter argue that we could remove the cacao nibs from kraft pouches and then ship them over then ship them over to Shena along with the balance to be sourced and shipped from Brazil. 

From a profit and loss perspective, it doesn‚Äôt make any business sense. Not only do we have to consider the write off of the kraft pouches and man hours already value-added to the inventory during the time of transforming of loose unbagged cacao nibs into 8 ounce kraft pouches. We also have to take into consideration the additional man hour that DAO will incur removing the cacao nibs from the kraft pouches.

It presents a clear case for bad business sense.

*Conclusion*
Should this dispute be escalated to the Delaware court in USA for resolution, the above line of reasoning will be presented to the judge. Regardless of the outcome, this makes for a good educational experience of the exceptions to be considered both from a legal and accounting stand point to be considered when crafting up smart contracts on the blockchain <This message was edited>",1TDG For every 1 USD of liquidity injected,1500.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded,1500.00,20240916

to run a successful
Logistics operations, we need to run a tight ship

Every time we incur unnecessary expenses, we are eating away at our profit margin

A huge part of the reason why I am opting to stay in Itacare right now in a hostel and cooking every meal 

- Hostel cost per night: USD$6

- ‚Å†Cost per self cooked meal: USD$4

- ‚Å†two meals a day

- ‚Å†daily expenses: under USD$20

Or when back in USA living in the car, with the specific goal of totally removing the rent component from my monthly expenses 

_PS: just to give an example, when I was back in Singapore in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis, starting my own technology consulting business, I opted to walk for 13 hours from one end of the island back home after receiving $120 from the payment of an assignment after the train service was totally out instead of wasting $30 just to get to get home in a taxi._

_That is how tight I watch the expense budget_

The general
consensus is to concentrate our resources on the USA market where we have trusted people to operate our supply chain, and have already established our legal infrastructure which gives us a critical edge as compared to the European market where we have neither

- trusted team of guild members to operate our supply chain

- ‚Å†critical legal edge that forces all Brazilian suppliers to go through us to bring their goods into USA

- ‚Å†connection between Brazilian suppliers and USA buyers is sparse which creates a lot of value when setting up the connections from a network effects perspective

The Brazilian suppliers have already very well established connection with buyers in Europe. No economic incentive whatever so for them to insert another middleman into the existing well established value chain.

He works for the Brazil‚Äôs NASA equivalent space agency

Seems what I mentioned, now that AI has became so prevalent, regarding shifting focus of human effort RnD endeavor to areas where AI don‚Äôt really have a structural edge is not very far fetched more specifically *_Extreme harsh terrains*_

Embrapa (_Brazil‚Äôs equivalent to USDA_) is now doing RnD on how to develop seeds that can germinate and grow on the moon‚Äôs environment 

And it is not only that agency. There seems to be an unspoken space race going on right now on how can colonize moon first now that everyone realize mars is way harder than expected in terms of logistics 

Also the idea I have surfaced as early as the year before made total sense during our discussion this afternoon. 

Now that we have figured out we can successfully perform terraforming (_aka climate change_) it makes sense to run smaller scale experiments in the Californian and Arizonan desert region other variants of climate change which is more calibrated and controlled

Once we figured those out transplant the working prototypes from the desert on to the surface of the moon 

@120363045796860099@g.us V1 surfaces again

What is the package difference between TCP and UDP",Unknown,0.00,,0.00,20241012
Meta AI,,"TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental protocols used for data communication over the internet. The main differences between TCP and UDP packets are:

*TCP Packet:*

1. Header size: 20-60 bytes
2. Contains:
    - Source port number (16 bits)
    - Destination port number (16 bits)
    - Sequence number (32 bits)
    - Acknowledgment number (32 bits)
    - Data offset (4 bits)
    - Reserved (3 bits)
    - Flags (9 bits)
    - Window size (16 bits)
    - Checksum (16 bits)
    - Urgent pointer (16 bits)
3. Reliable, connection-oriented protocol
4. Error-checked and corrected
5. Ordered delivery of packets

*UDP Packet:*

1. Header size: 8 bytes
2. Contains:
    - Source port number (16 bits)
    - Destination port number (16 bits)
    - Length (16 bits)
    - Checksum (16 bits)
3. Unreliable, connectionless protocol
4. No error correction or ordering guarantees
5. Faster transmission due to minimal overhead

Key differences:

1. Reliability: TCP ensures reliable data transfer, while UDP does not guarantee delivery.
2. Connection: TCP establishes a connection before data transfer, whereas UDP sends data without establishing a connection.
3. Error correction: TCP performs error correction, whereas UDP does not.
4. Ordering: TCP ensures ordered delivery, whereas UDP does not.

When to use each:

- TCP: File transfers, email, web browsing, remote access
- UDP: Online gaming, video streaming, VoIP, real-time applications

Gary Teh,,@13135550002 makes a lot of sense for our DAO to model our actions/packets to UDP packets since we are literally running a meta game ü§©üôè,Unknown,0.00,,0.00,20241012
Meta AI,,"That's a fascinating approach! Modeling your DAO's actions/packets after UDP packets can provide flexibility and efficiency. Since UDP prioritizes speed over reliability, it might suit a meta game requiring rapid interactions.

Considerations:

- Error tolerance: Design robust error handling mechanisms.
- Packet loss mitigation: Implement packet retransmission or redundancy.
- Security: Ensure data authenticity and integrity.

DAO-specific:

- Decision-making: Adapt UDP's connectionless nature for decentralized decision-making.
- Action execution: Mirror UDP's fast transmission for swift action execution.

Explore potential synergies:

- Real-time communication
- Event-driven architecture
- Distributed systems

Shena‚Äôs move has technically helped financed bulk of the 400kg cacao almonds purchased in exchange for TDG.

Which technically means DAO finally owns its own set of cacao inventory to buy and sell for a profit and keep rolling the funds forward for ever larger sales volume. 

And DAO does not need to rely on _annoying_ external investors moving forward to finance future shipments.

And DAO members contributing to the sales and marketing of this DAO centrally controlled pool of inventory can claim themselves to be entrepreneurs collectively helping grow our pool of capital

Meta AI,,"Zhuge Liang, also known as the Sleeping Dragon, chose Jingzhou (also known as Jiangling) as his strategic location for several reasons:

1. Geographical advantage: Jingzhou is situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, providing control over the river's traffic and access to central China.

2. Proximity to enemy territories: Jingzhou bordered Wu to the east and Wei to the north, allowing Zhuge Liang to monitor and respond to enemy movements.

3. Resource availability: Jingzhou was an agricultural hub, ensuring food security and resources for Shu Han.

4. Defensibility: Jingzhou's natural barriers, like rivers and mountains, offered protection against invaders.

5. Information hub: Jingzhou's location facilitated gathering intelligence on rival kingdoms.

Zhuge Liang's choice of Jingzhou showcased his strategic brilliance, enabling him to:

- Monitor enemy movements
- Control key resources
- Respond swiftly to threats
- Gather vital intelligence

When we get the chance, could we set up a meeting with the team at Q.org to further explore how their InterPol governance mechanism works? 

It might make sense for us to write our off chain inventory balances of the various warehouse on their chain and then rely on InterPol for recourse in scenarios of exceptions in case what‚Äôs been reported does not tele with what is actually in the individual warehouses

At some point when there are lots of different batches floating along our supply chain, it might make sense to utilize an NFT to represent each batch of loose cacao nibs / cacao almonds that arrives in our factories and warehouses 

This is aligned with the two accounting principles 

1. historical cost principle 

2. first in first out principle 

*Historical cost principle*
states that all cost associated with manufacturing and transporting of a unit of product needs to be tabulated into its cost of goods 

*First in First out principle*
States that when the unit cost for each batch of the same goods differ, the sale must assume the first unit that was received is the one that is considered sold 

As such, the unit cost of the loose cacao nibs in in USA right now will be different from the unit cost of the batch in its way to our San Francisco warehouse and is also different from the ones right now sitting in our warehouse in Ilheus 

Manually tracking all these on a Google sheet will start becoming very tedious at some point, tracking these via NFTs on the blockchain start making sense

Gary Teh,,"I spoke with Master Bico Duro, my capoeira instructor 

He runs a children education program here where he teaches them capoeira after they are done with normal school hours to keep them off the streets while learning something useful

I will be helping him film a 12 weeks / one lesson per week capoeira course and then taking the curriculum and conducting them when I am back in USA 

Attendees can come to attend for free. They can donate whatever they want in a donation jar. 

Proceeds will go towards helping finance the children program. 

Meanwhile our @120363044028036610@g.us cacao bags and banner will be on display during the capoeira lessons. These lessons will be conducted right on the beach or in the desert

Proceeds from the sale of those will be directed to our DAO‚Äôs coffers 

Capoeira seems like a good alternative for folks who likes doing CrossFit but don‚Äôt want to have such a pricey experience 

Also it is something that they could do by themselves at home without any equipment but just their body weight 

Since it‚Äôs a 12 lessons course, it also provides a good reason for them to keep coming back if they haven‚Äôt purchased our cacao nibs yet ü§©üôè

Gary Teh,,"From a individual financial motivation perspective, shifting inventory management from our Google sheet to either Solana or Ethereum based smart contract is making a huge bet that our DAO‚Äôs governance token value will increase at a rate faster than the value of either coin since warehouse managers will be forced to pay gas fees in those currencies before they are allowed to update inventory records 

From my perspective there is no reason to believe such would be the case given there is yet a clearly established scaleable sales and marketing channel for our cacao. Also it is important to take into account major cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing in market valuation at the moment due to Trump‚Äôs election

Gary Teh,,"Biden‚Äôs recent visit to the Amazon 2 days ago as well as fear that Trump will pull a reverse on climate change policies might both serve as tailwind for Agroverse project 

We will know for sure when I put our new cacao nibs packaging on display on the 17th December at Graph Network‚Äôs 4th anniversary party 

If signals are strong then perhaps might be feasible to target all the distribution channels in the deep blue states to gather sales and feedback

WWIII has started with the following countries forming an axis 

- China 
- ‚Å†Russia
- ‚Å†North Korea
- ‚Å†Iran 

USA retracts its resources internationally to focus inwards and meanwhile trimming all the fats in its bureaucracy that has slowly accumulated during times of peace since WWII

We should be expecting a lot of near shoring activities in the meantime as USA attempts to mitigate its industry from supply chain disruptions

Pre-WWII much of USA military and commercial interest were focused was on north and South America with both the Atlantic and pacific oceans acting as strategic moats against foreign invasion 

This time around, China‚Äôs belt road initiative has already deeply penetrated much of South America providing critical infrastructure should they decide to establish military footprints in the region. It presents a challenge to USA of purely relying on these two oceans using defensive moats. Here in Ilheus on the Atlantic coast is a port that is Chinese built as well as a Chinese built railway that is expected to extend all the way to the pacific coast

This is primarily attributed to the sudden surge in USD/Brazilian Reis caused by the election of Donald Trump as the forthcoming president. Prior to this the USD was gradually weakening against the Brazilian Reis primarily due to the easing of the Federal Interest rates...

*High level considerations*

- Each bag of cacao nibs will be represented by an NFT
- each NFT will hold a historical record of all the cost and processing facilities associated with it
- Each warehouse will be represented by a smart contract controlled by the warehouse manager
- A occasion of transport of cargo from one warehouse to another is represented by a shipment smart contract 
- a shipment contains details of the courier service as well as the courier tracking number and cost of courier
- Shipment smart contract will be able to hold multiple NFTs

- Origin warehouse owner can instantiate a shipment smart contract and must indicate the destination warehouse owner smart contract, thereafter transfer the NFTs held in his warehouse smart contract to the 

- When the cargo has arrived at the destination warehouse, owner of the destination warehouse smart contract can then sign the shipment smart contract and have the NFTs transferred to his warehouse smart contract.
