[10/4/23, 3:38:21 PM] Gary Teh: Created a proposed roadmap for our entire DAO and included when sunmint project might actually come online 

https://TrueSight.me/roadmap

A lot of it is heavily dependent on Agroverse generating huge volumes of profits 🤔
[10/29/23, 4:59:40 PM] Gary Teh: *Insights gathered* about SunMint these past few months 

    - there are already lots of people doing off the grid data centers

    - setting an off the grid Bitcoin miner requires a two year payback period 

    - there really is no need for us to be managing our own chain to notarize Agroverse shipment passing through our supply chain as that space is already very crowded 

    - farmers and indigenous people have conflicting interest

*back to basic assumption about the future*

As climate change advances, 

    - surface area of desert will increase due to drought

    - surface area of the ocean will increase due to melting polar ice caps

     - indigenous are most familiar with traditional methods to restore the land 

*new thought direction*

    - what if large plots of waste (desert) land were purchased using surplus profits generated from Agroverse trading and made to remain open access to all and also allowed for management by the native indigenous people?  

    - what would a human colony on international waters look like? 

This is a video recording of Indy sharing about indigenous knowledge

Will pop by to pay it a visit over the weekend 

If it’s good, will close the deal with the agent before I leave for Davos Switzerland on the 11th of Jan, so that we can have a playground to experiment with for @⁨[project] Sun Mint Guild⁩ 

_PS: the agent seem concerned about my safety. And asked that I informed prior to my visit as well as after my visit so that I made it out alive from the patch of land… somehow this has increasingly become a recurring theme lately… 🤔🤣_

[1/4/24, 4:23:59 PM] Tres Garcia: Sorry… just dropped in out of curiosity and to see how everyone is doing. 

@14153000019 stay far away from all land related to flood zones. It is cheap for a reason. It floods… Desert floods are the worst, as there is little to no warning. Flood zone land may also come with guarantees that you never build on it. 

So look for something close by, but higher up. Will probably only have to spend 25% more
[1/4/24, 4:24:41 PM] Tres Garcia: & happy new year everybody
[1/4/24, 4:25:28 PM] Gary Teh: Ok!! Perhaps larger size and cheaper than 🤣

these were the general themes surfaced during discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

[2/6/24, 2:16:42 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I did attend the opening of zuzalu this past summer.
[2/6/24, 2:23:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Also something that could be interesting to ponder on aside from the obvious magic is the non magic variety: https://www.mycostories.com/?fbclid=PAAaZcIdIU4BfIi5A9owEkebzaKurMGsoe8A_S1BgLRub-6hOn6JLbK9lp7nY_aem_ARZ1YMuCvCaEIcBg8GRQnLRVDkxBoiMdtulMdksl339eTOvh31VsAyN-0yemgiunNXM 

A lot is going on in that front.
[2/6/24, 4:58:12 PM] David - California Land Owner Davos: That being said? So many start ups in the space are focused on direct to human consumption. Reasons?

In blind taste tests, crickets beat beef.

Crickets have a better amino/protein/carb mix than beef, by a long shot (really).
[2/6/24, 4:58:52 PM] David - California Land Owner Davos: Problem? American consumers cannot handle insects.

[2/6/24, 5:01:44 PM] Gary Teh: Just do it here dude. That is the purpose of this guild 🙂🙏

Figure what to grow on the plot of land
[2/6/24, 10:14:00 PM] Gary Teh: The second milestone we should hit before end of this calendar year is to achieve either one of these two conditions 

- mined and sold cryptocurrencies using solar power generated via the off grid facility we have setup on our piece of land 

- ⁠sold and generated fiat cash of something produced using raw materials from our piece of land. Sales should either be direct or via @120363044028036610@g.us Amazon account or Wix account 

Otherwise, I don’t know what this guild has been spending time on the entire year 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

_PS: milestone 1 is have someone finally sign on the sales agreement paper for that plot of land in the desert_ ‎<This message was edited>

Reached out to another 3 agents. Observed that some of the plots don’t have agents associated with them but is interfaced directly with Staff of Realtor.com which doesn’t really do much… 

_PS: need to start drafting up the list of tasks to be done if and when the plot becomes available_

- people will be willing to drive 2.5 hours just to dump off their stuff 
- ⁠goodwill probably doesn’t want to sort out the stuff
- ⁠people want to sell their trailers first cheap. Make sure they deliver instead of you picking it up (e.g. USd250-500)
- ⁠people get to know about her camp because they were visiting East Jesus 
- ⁠people come to the last free place for an experience 
- ⁠folks curious to ask questions about how to live off the grid and even offer tips for advice received

- spiritual people end up being nomadic at some point 

- ⁠I observed nomads either fall into two categories, walking the spiritual path or loosing their way at some point getting involved with drugs such as fentanyl or meth and dying from overdose

- ⁠build Japanese style bunk beds in container for nomads contributing to Sunmint projects 

- ⁠food and shelter provided for by guild

- ⁠we might even use AI to streamline and contract construction projects that are aligned with our purpose of healing the world with love (_repairing churches and monasteries_)

- ⁠farming facility can be built on 6 acre land of priest in Wisconsin area beside @19209806391 house 

- ⁠retirement facility like the ones setup by San Francisco Zen Center can be considered 

*Next steps*
- construction of bunk beds in container on @19209806391 property 

- ⁠tap facility of @19209806391 friend in Arizona 

- ⁠start bidding for construction projects using AI

In short concise bullet points, What are the different daily needs areas that we should do further RnD when building an off grid civilization in the arid desert

Some areas that came to mind 

- drinking water generation 
- ⁠energy generation
- ⁠energy storage 
- ⁠food production
[7/24/24, 1:06:35 PM] <guild>[project] SunMint Guild: ‎Only messages that mention @Meta AI are sent to Meta. Meta can't read any other messages in this chat. Some responses may be inaccurate or inappropriate.
[2/18/24, 1:21:29 PM] Meta AI: Great starting points! Here are some additional daily needs areas to consider for further R&D in building an off-grid civilization in the arid desert:

• Shelter and construction materials
• Waste management and recycling
• Clothing and textiles
• Communication and connectivity
• Healthcare and medical resources
• Education and knowledge sharing
• Personal hygiene and sanitation
• Safety and security measures
• Transportation and mobility
• Social and community building
• Psychological well-being and mental health

These areas are crucial for creating a sustainable and self-sufficient community in the desert. By focusing on research and development in these areas, you can ensure that the basic needs of the inhabitants are met, and the community can thrive in the long term. ‎<This message was edited>

Please edit to whatever is necessary
[2/18/24, 1:31:28 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful @918017107841! Thank you for offering do online research to find more materials we could use to do RnD on in our off grid facility

[2/18/24, 1:35:00 PM] Anupa/diya: In that case from my experience of publication design. What is the picture will this be for research or is it a coffee table book 

If it's a coffee table book. Photos are the main thing. Photos will are captioned and labelled . 

In india, many wedding companies are getting this community photo accounts where everyone uploads their photos to a common cloud
[2/18/24, 1:37:00 PM] Anupa/diya: This is great research for trekking communities, competitions like Barclays running, or even for music festivals that happen in the deserts or mountains.
[2/18/24, 1:38:06 PM] Anupa/diya: The photographic account can be a project of it's own.
[2/18/24, 1:39:03 PM] Anupa/diya: Please make sure that whatever info is gotten for the book is validated and also the copyright to print
[2/18/24, 2:03:53 PM] Gary Teh: Primarily research books
[2/18/24, 2:05:50 PM] Anupa/diya: In that case, you will be more sure of the authenticity and referencing of the information. Research cataloging is key
[2/18/24, 2:10:42 PM] Gary Teh: Would yoj open to coming up with a system for that?
[2/18/24, 2:22:54 PM] Anupa/diya: I wouldn't be the person. Someone with an editorial background should it. 

I can suggest 
1. Photos .Description and date 
2.  Academic referencing it's the book, author date , year .. I am not sure. There are lot of book generators like world cat.org
[2/18/24, 2:23:22 PM] Anupa/diya: An editor will have to be brought into the picture for structuring and proofing

[2/19/24, 11:24:28 PM] Gary Teh: Yes and we can then start assembling ideas we want to test for the following area which we can then compile into book
[2/20/24, 2:10:19 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 I am aware that you are proposing a social media strategy 

Could you help us understand in more detail how that strategy you have in mind works and also how it ties in to the larger picture 🙂🙏
[2/20/24, 2:22:51 AM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363045796860099@g.us* 

As linear economy business models progress, climate change intensifies, resulting in expanded desert land and rising sea levels. How can humans adapt to this reality without perpetuating the forces that fueled the change?
[7/15/24, 8:14:45 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/20/24, 2:23:11 AM] Gary Teh: After rounds of discussion this seems to be the set of hypothesis that @120363045796860099@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to utilize waste collected from the surrounding area to turn a barren piece of land into a productive one 

- ⁠productivity could be achieved by systematic application of circular economy principles 

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of soil regeneration through the use of waste material (_courtesy of @41765737357_)

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of permaculture techniques used by the indigenous on regenerated soil

- ⁠productivity could be achieved via construction of off grid data center facility where bulk if not all of the materials are scavenged from elsewhere at a fraction of the commercial cost if not for free

- ⁠productivity could be achieved with minimal deployment of fiat resources

If there is a purpose of creating a publication on the who how where what why. It might be a good idea to Extention the idea of this kind of lifestyle via social media . 

It started with gary building a portable car shade and I suggested a tiktok preferably page can be done for others to see how easily these hacks can be made.

I have some every nice "interior" spaces of vehicles with such great utilise which can easily build awareness with DIY page

It can be for individuals, festivals companies to showcase their products and advertise and more so to advocate this sustainable and minimal lifestyle can be adopted

[7/15/24, 8:18:00 AM] Gary Teh: For collaboration with indigenous in Amazonas Let’s just focus on these points 

- figure out if cacao can be cultivated there 

- ⁠how to help finance the 200 cacao trees to get them shipped to them 

- how to ship out the cacao out to USA once they are ready

- ⁠figure out what type of specialists they will need access to to be able to cultivate the cacao 

- figure out how to help them setup an entity with a CNPJ number so that the exporting can happen ‎<This message was edited>

[7/15/24, 11:06:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 09:47 until 11:02. I updated her about the important points on the process as having someone to report to you directly or me on how the cultivation was going, the importance to contact people who understand about the legal process of indigenous communities when they are not demarcated by the government yet (I delivered her the responsibility to get in touch with the authorities and ask about it, remarking upon how important this is for us to start even planning). I also mentioned we would start just with one community and see how it goes. She was imagining two or more but we settled for one.

Checking legally. 3.Checking with Embrapa if they work with training and cocoa plants as the community has no knowledge in growing then yet.  4. Check the costs of implementing machines so they can do the nibs or checking if there is a place where they can get the nibs. 5. Checking prices. 6. 4.Suni talks with her father and her family about the project. 7. Travelling and talking in person with the leadership/owner of the land.

[3/17/24, 5:23:32 AM] Gary Teh: Hi Brother,  this are the Box to raise the seblings. Also some Information for planting bags. ☀️🙏🍀
[7/17/24, 4:03:09 PM] Emelin - Bahia: have you asked about the possibility of working with a technician in this project? I would call them, but if you have this contact maybe we can get all the info.
[3/17/24, 5:23:32 AM] Gary Teh: Let me know, when you need more informations. ✨🪷🙏
[7/17/24, 4:03:25 PM] Emelin - Bahia: At least to know if it is possible.
[3/17/24, 5:23:45 AM] Gary Teh: Hans Martin contributed this for Sun Mint
[7/17/24, 4:04:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The idea here is to have the education first, showing how to take care of the seedlings (it would be interesting if they can be together with the planting because they (the community people) don't have knowledge on cabruca.

[7/17/24, 4:07:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Having Suni as responsible and being there, she can give support informing the situation and if something comes up, we need to know how much they charge per visit (or if they wouldn't charge and would like to be partners)
‎[3/17/24, 6:30:09 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/17/24, 4:07:39 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Maybe another one. Here I'm adding info that is between you, me and Suni.

[3/20/24, 11:22:49 AM] Gary Teh: Ended up just deploying capital to $RIOT the company trading on Nasdaq

[3/23/24, 1:53:50 AM] Gary Teh: I was at the church of enlightenment for dinner. They were giving out dinner in Styrofoam boxes. I think it will be a great idea to use the free clay found by the Hot Springs to make this so that they don’t have to use Styrofoam boxes to hold the food.
[7/17/24, 4:11:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Course/training  2. If they work with Cabruca method 3. How much they charge or not to evaluate the soil and the land (what is needed for this as well). 4. How much they charge for visits to follow the process in the first months, how many visits would be necessary (so we know maximum/minimum) after the planting. 4. If they work with partnership due to the fact that is an indigenous land.
[3/23/24, 1:54:41 AM] Gary Teh: People come to Slab City to buy souvenirs right now the folks your get materials from outside to make souvenir to sell if we use the way here and turn them into souvenir like place or plates or cups, and then sell them. Then we are generating money and at the same time also, reducing the trash Logical conclusion no trash left in Slab City

Seems everything is falling into place  🤩🙏
[7/17/24, 11:22:48 PM] Gary Teh: *Key Takeaways on what was discussed with Karen Hardy*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface…
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Aggrieves is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit.
[7/18/24, 8:29:35 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Good morning. Feedback on Paulo's indication. His friend, João, send me an audio saying he is still in college (to say he doesn't have the required knowledge yet, that Paulo must have jumped to conclusions about him. He also said he is busy and his agenda is tight here in Ilhéus.
[7/18/24, 8:33:03 AM] Emelin - Bahia: These ones sound like bad planning. That is why I believe that giving time to plan something is not wasted time.   - Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give.
