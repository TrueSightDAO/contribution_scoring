[12/18/22, 2:07:10 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Thank you @14153000019 I am glad to have found some ingredients for my cosmetics in africa, fair traded and organic, what makes me very grateful at the first place. But I don‚Äôt think this is enough. The supply chain is not perfectly transparent. I wish to know where my karit√©e is being hatvested and who is taking care of the soil. In my certification (cradle to cradle certified gold) it is quite difficult to change suppliers, but I can always upgrade to the better. Biodynamic agriculture for example. Since I am only buying small amounts, I am very dependent on my distributors, but I hope to chance that asap. Happy to follow your chat here.
[12/18/22, 3:47:35 PM] Gary Teh: We already have some stuff sourced 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbbrDWe-LhxEPTBCJQQoiIGy-3uffZaGu0KWu7PZBWs/edit

Happy to source for more Ingredients that you need for your products 

What are some ingredients that you are currently sourcing from Africa
[12/18/22, 11:34:42 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is Shea butter and Passifloraseedoil. But in order to include it to my list, it would need some certifications. Bio/organic/natrue/cosmos. I wonder, if we could give prove of invitonment safe and ethical sourcing using technology. What do you have in mind for this?
[12/19/22, 6:07:57 AM] Gary Teh: I think of two options 

- source for a certification authority to provide the certification 

- come up with our own auditing process and then do the issue (we need to get into the QC anyways)
[12/19/22, 6:09:21 AM] Gary Teh: I believe @41799155602 made a introduction earlier on to someone knowledgeable about QC. We could start investigating into that with him
[12/19/22, 6:26:57 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I guess that would be needed. Keeping the control. But that is basically what makes the Project a bit of work. Taking random certifications might not include small and fair business and that is, what I believe something to change. It should be easy to excess, affordable and transparent.
[12/19/22, 6:34:24 AM] Peter Peng: This screams blockchain and smart contracts

Hi Gary - I'm not familiar with obtaining a letter of credit.

On the certification side - Off the top of my head, the "Environmental Working Group" has been around since the 90s advocating for the ethical treatment of workers and consumer transparency. They are one of the most popular certs in the health & beauty realms

Should get a revert soon 

I am assuming your distributor based in Switzerland was handling the importing paper works? üôÇ
[12/19/22, 11:38:42 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I am going through different suppliers. In France and Germany. Swiss are just Subsuppliers. It is very complicated. From my Passiflora, I don‚Äôt have the exact origin! Cosmetic industries are used to work very intransparent. It is changing slowly. And the labels @41791555798 mentioned are known in the food sector, I have not done a propper research to find out how they work. I do have only one supplier in Germany that I trust entirely. They have a very few row materials, but are in contact with the source. Taking personally care for each step and handling it very well. These guys might even be interested to use such a system once it is working. They did, but I like, and went all around an existing system. Very personal and transparent. I love new technologies and would like to have sexy, easy solutions for the future. Keeping the personal approach, but macking it accessible to many. Being able to include smaller independent producers. As I wrote before, keeping the cost affordable. So the money goes to the soil rather than getting taken by all processes in between before getting to the costumer. But a verification system is necessary in order to keep the transparency, and the quality high. Yes, the distributors provide us with all product data sheets and thake care the products are trsted for whatever they need to be tested by law.
[12/19/22, 11:40:26 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: tested
[12/20/22, 12:01:02 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Hello @41765737357, what about setting up a call and we discuss what you would need and have done so far. This way it would be more efficient for me to start a proper research on the certifications. There are quite a lot of certifications e.g. for natural  cosmetics (just made a quick google research and found this overview for example https://www.ecco-verde.ch/de-CH/themen/zertifikate) and I think finding one that works both in Switzerland and the EU would be great.  Is this your homepage: https://www.karinlanz.ch? Please let me know, when you are available for a call (if you like). Thank you. Anita (I speak German)

@16468233438 has kindly offered to renew the registration for that legal entity for this forthcoming year. Should amount to USD450.

The amount he paid for the renewal will be issued out to him in terms of shares in TrueTech Inc at USD1 per share. 

The same amount of governance tokens will be issued by TrueSight DAO to TrueTech Inc to be included as part of its holdings. 

So for every share issued out of TrueTech Inc, it will have a corresponding holding of TrueSight DAO Governance tokens

@254729080961 has managed to hel source for Coffee supplies in Kenya 

And since we have a list of purchasing agents here in the list you provided we might have hit jackpot regarding matching supplies and demand. ü§©

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1ShLiC64Mm0eqyohk9BujwE1g0_8rXITM/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msexcel

 I guess the next thing is to tokenize the making of cold calls to the purchasing agents too

That way once goods pass through EcoVerse21 from the suppliers to the buyers all the folks in the middle who have contributed to the linking up of the supply chain will end up getting remunerated via appreciation of token value ü§©
[2/4/23, 4:09:25 AM] Anupa/diya: This has to be researched in detail because normally shipping is done via DHL or FedEx via bussiness accounts.
The storage of any produce for wholesale is a huge expense since they have to be kept in temp controlled environments and other details.

It might be good to have an incentive attached or some kind of tokenomics 

As there is a powerplay and corruption in this bussiness, governance tokens have to be awarded to people with the right ethos or  a set of principles of Dao guidelines should be imposed

[2/9/23, 12:43:11 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect overlapping it seems. I am sure I will see you again in Zurich the next time I pop by in Europe.
[2/9/23, 12:43:40 PM] Gary Teh: For the coffee beans, if needed, we could arrange to have some samples shipped over. üôÇüôè
[2/9/23, 12:43:54 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Plane leaving 25th üôà
[2/9/23, 2:13:27 PM] Gary Teh: Our movements are so perfectly in sync we are running parallel ü§£
[2/9/23, 5:57:50 PM] Anupa/diya: If we look at coffee beans, then our target market would be roasters like Karin mentioned or buyers who sell to roasters. Coffee beans are normally washed or unwashed at this point and can't be indirectly used for commercial use.

There are companies who sell coffee beans kits so the consumer can self grade, self wash, self roast, self grind, and then make. Which might be cool
[2/9/23, 5:59:23 PM] Anupa/diya: If we can find coffee farmers who have access to units  roasting in their some county. Tts easier
[2/9/23, 5:59:46 PM] Anupa/diya: I have a roaster s list somewhere. Let me look for it
[2/9/23, 6:01:57 PM] Anupa/diya: Coffee might be a good place to start because like the oriental tea service. In Ethiopia, coffee has its own coffee ceremony
[2/9/23, 6:05:39 PM] Anupa/diya: Called Addaa Buna. Buna is coffee 
Apparently Eritrea has their own ceremony has well
[2/9/23, 7:53:41 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Thanks for taking the initiative! üôÇüôè

He knows of folks in souther America who supply coffee beans as well üôÇüôè
[2/9/23, 7:56:13 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. It definitely feels just focusing on one commodity (coffee bean in this case) helps focus our attention for this project as well as accelerate the compounding of network effects ü§©

I wonder if you would be interested to surface a few more relevant set of tokenizable actions within the scope of this project that community members can contribute towards in exchange for governance tokens üôÇüôè
[2/11/23, 8:21:35 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @14153000019 
Hello :)

Here it is.
[2/11/23, 3:13:09 PM] Tres Garcia: ‚ÄéTres Garcia left
[2/12/23, 6:39:48 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes sure .. can do .

If we are looking at coffee ..

We will need to narrow down on which is the user group are we planning to start with

If the farmer of any produce is the focal point.. that would be quite revolutionary depending on the country 

If we are looking at the roaster, then our journey would be different 



If we Start with
[2/13/23, 4:27:49 AM] Gary Teh: Could you elaborate on both? üôÇ
[2/13/23, 7:56:21 AM] Anupa/diya: If we are looking at product fit to the service 

We need to identify 
1. What is the problem area or the area of opportunity we are trying to address
2. Who are the people 
3. What is the ecosystem or service system  are they in now
4. What are the gaps and challenges they face 

We might have an solution in mind but how do you cater it to the user group

Depending on the user group, we can tailor our web 3 context not solution to the actual scenario to build the most probable outcome.
[2/13/23, 8:01:24 AM] Anupa/diya: In an project like that, one will  have to factor natural resources + energy + climate , currency and global/national exchanges, physical storage, trading, regulations, human capacity + dynamics, time, geographic location, cultural and ethnographic backgrounds and rituals
[2/13/23, 8:01:37 AM] Anupa/diya: Please feel to add to this
[2/13/23, 9:22:03 AM] Gary Teh: Based on what we have learned so far from @971561302188, Tushar (who had left the room), Tres (who has left the room), Aga (not in the room) these are the following assumptions about the sell side

Statement 1) African producers are not able to secure fair price for their produce

Statement 2) middle men are imposing unfair prices when procuring these goods from them 

Statement 3) middlemen are artificially restricting supplies to keep prices elevated on the consumer side 

Statement 4) it is challenging to acquire certification to become eligible for exports to buyer destination 


Based on what we know from @41765737357 these are what we have learned from the buy side

Statement A) buyers on the European side are concerned with whether the processes used to grow these produce are environmentally friendly (not specific to coffee though. Needs to be proven this problem exist for coffee)

My hunch is if there is actually a problem to be solved after validation, it would make sense to go for it. Otherwise this project will end up heading in the direction of Cypher defense (aka the graveyard ü§îü§£)
[2/13/23, 9:27:30 AM] Anupa/diya: Just to add to statement  A .. Process authentication, licenses, pricing and transportation
[2/13/23, 9:28:54 AM] Anupa/diya: If the middle man can be limited and the farmers can directly trade with a buyer, that's beyond fabulous. Web 3 can do that, thats real change. It has a direct impact on the economy
[2/13/23, 9:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: Are these processes currently handled by the middle men?
[2/13/23, 9:30:28 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I can corroborate on the seller side issues.
[2/13/23, 9:31:55 AM] Anupa/diya: For what I have seen, the farmers need grading resources, storage plants, transport and mostly the centralized systems fix the price
[2/13/23, 9:32:23 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I had built a platform for this in 2019 and the greatest challenge was onboarding farmers.

Back then, they preferred having everything abstracted.

Also, you'll find that how fast the exchange happens matters a lot. Which is something middlemen capitalize on.
[2/13/23, 9:44:50 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes thats very true, the exchange movement is rapid. 

For my experience, onboarding is not easy at all as well  the grass root level adoption has to be very very solid and efficient. However, farmers also have a phone and someone of the family can use it. They do have daily meet ups for conversation exchange and are driven by social community change. 

Yet again, what kind of farmers are we looking .. they vary from single generation family to small and medium scale businesses. In person interaction is key for something like this.

Farming is almost political driven by most countries. That's another thing 

If we choose a rooster, then we will have to see where are they located. Many farmers don't have close access to roasters, it's either in a different city or even country.
[2/15/23, 3:43:18 AM] Gary Teh: Simple rules we abide by in this space 

1) When coming to a fork in the road and in doubt  get a majority vote 

2) when realize no one has any idea of a missing piece find more people to join that are willing to contribute missing piece 

Both actions awards you with governance token grants üôÇüëç

[2/15/23, 3:47:05 AM] Anupa/diya: ü§£ü§£ i believe in  community voices in most cases.
[2/15/23, 3:47:38 AM] Anupa/diya: As a group it will be a good idea to see which route we want to take as a first mission.
[2/15/23, 3:48:28 AM] Gary Teh: Want to create a poll? üôÇ
[2/15/23, 3:48:33 AM] Anupa/diya: Which is the market produce we would like to look into. 

Is it small scale or wholesale  or what kind of categories
[2/15/23, 3:48:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I was thinking. To start with maybe we can actually start a conversation on slack
‚Äé[2/15/23, 3:49:11 AM] Gary Teh: ‚Äéimage omitted

[3/14/23, 8:22:44 AM] Anupa/diya: Ecoverse has taken a new turn
[3/14/23, 8:23:06 AM] Anupa/diya: I propose a very short and quick workshop as we are all super busy with time.
[3/14/23, 8:24:03 AM] Anupa/diya: I urge the people who are or know about commodity transaction like buying and selling to drop in.
[3/14/23, 8:26:00 AM] Gary Teh: Yes please! ü§©
[3/14/23, 8:27:59 AM] Anupa/diya: We are looking at building a service for the commodity market and we have found a product fit for it
[3/14/23, 8:28:17 AM] Anupa/diya: We need some kind of initial testing.
[3/14/23, 8:29:06 AM] Anupa/diya: If you can suggest potential people who could aid the conversation (doesn't have to be a part of the DAO) that will be great
[3/14/23, 8:30:11 AM] Francois renet: Can you clarify?
[3/14/23, 8:31:15 AM] Gary Teh: @41765737357 would be great to get your inputs as well
[3/14/23, 8:34:25 AM] Anupa/diya: Pricing is a huge area of opportunity or challenge for the produce market
[3/14/23, 8:36:29 AM] Anupa/diya: Find the right price for the buyer or the seller is a task. In most faces, it is third party dependant and eliminates the seller from the decision making
[3/14/23, 8:36:39 AM] Francois renet: I meant how will the service be presented? As an app?
[3/14/23, 8:37:28 AM] Anupa/diya: Well in most cases, that's the most feasible representation
[3/14/23, 8:39:32 AM] Anupa/diya: However, I see to pre-empt a solution at the beginning might negate a great outcome 

The aim of this quick workshop just look at the current scenarios of pricing exchange and visibility. What are the thoughts of buyers and sellers on pricing.
[3/14/23, 8:40:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Tomas, Gary and myself have been in conversation. I would like to open it up to the group cause there is no decentralized pricing service for agro community as per my knowledge
[3/14/23, 8:41:36 AM] Anupa/diya: This has great potential to bring the voice the sellers to the stage and that would be a game changer. Who knows

[3/22/23, 3:20:59 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys! I was thinking about the aggregation platform, and then to Karin‚Äôs comments, and how she purchases some of her products from large corporations‚Äô surplus. 

Are you guys familiar with the Queen of Raw? She set up something similar for textiles. Manufacturers can resell their surplus of textiles and other manufacturers can buy them. It‚Äôs a sustainability play in as far as we are using unused resources versus polluting by creating more. 

Perhaps a similar system could be set up for other commodities/products?

I also believe that reaching out to certifiers to get a list of the companies they have certified could help cut through the noise. 

Just my Wednesday morning 5 cent ideas!
[3/22/23, 7:01:14 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: An other 5 cent: in terms of working with agricultural products in the circular way a platform could be cross industry. Lanolin comes from wool. We use one sent extracted from sugar cane waste that smells like patchouli‚Ä¶
[3/22/23, 7:01:37 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Ok, that just didn‚Äôt narrow it down üòÖ
[3/22/23, 7:07:01 AM] Francois renet: This is great @41765737357! Dream big or go home!
[3/22/23, 7:07:21 AM] Francois renet: Built the right way with the right people this could be huge!
[3/22/23, 7:07:40 AM] Francois renet: Add scientists and product developers to the mix and BANG!
[3/22/23, 7:08:42 AM] Francois renet: Actually, if you could come up with a couple of ideas of how textiles/wool could be repurposed, I am happy to speak to the Queen and see if we could piggy back off of her platform!!
[3/22/23, 7:13:10 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Well, what is spinning in my head right now would be a platform for side streams. So, first onboarding ‚Äòbigger‚Äô players (already certified and on the market) to trade their side products. Then hook smaller farmers and nitch products‚Ä¶
[3/22/23, 7:14:24 AM] Francois renet: How do we get to these people?
[3/22/23, 7:14:42 AM] Francois renet: Or do we build a skeleton platform first and then invite them?
[3/22/23, 7:25:31 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: before building, we might need some market research. if waste of our resources is the biggest problem of our time, this might be the point to start. only high quality producers are at this moment aware of side streams, because their products are so valuable, you would not want to waste any of it. then again these guys must already have been thinking about solutions ‚Ä¶
[3/22/23, 7:41:23 AM] Francois renet: You‚Äôd be surprised how much people with blinders @41765737357! The lack of imagination and vision is baffling!
[3/22/23, 7:51:07 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes this is imperative for us to look at the key stakeholders and then pin point on our user group along with the viability.. we can also build a persona... which is a representation of the potential user dea we trying to solve the problem 

What is our area that we are trying to solve or what is the area of opportunity we are trying to build on
[3/22/23, 7:51:49 AM] Anupa/diya: I agree ! Go big or go home !
[3/22/23, 7:53:44 AM] Francois renet: I think the areas are multiple. But perhaps we start by trying to solve the roadblocks/opportunities for members of the group such as @41765737357 ?
[3/22/23, 7:57:05 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes I will set up the miro board which I suggested yesterday so we can continue the brainstorming there to see what is feasible 

We can have 3 areas 

Opportunities ... gaps and challenges... these can be insights by us and research... can be quantitative data..

It will be easier to see the feasibility and viability as well
[3/22/23, 7:58:58 AM] Francois renet: @14153000019! We always come back to the first conversation we ever had my brother. It‚Äôs all about creating THE network of trust, purpose and execution!

I believe in taking what we have, use streams that already exist, give it an extra value and then work back the supply chain and have an impact on the sourcing (environmental and social)

[3/22/23, 9:25:42 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I have not looked into it yet. When I started looking for the mating powder I could only find it from perls somewhere in the south east pacific and it sounded like very far away no control and like a waste. i stopped the development process because of not satisfying solutions, but I thought by myself, I should open a side business and starting to trade resources. opening side streams. i wanted to safe this for later. üòä

[3/23/23, 9:42:25 AM] Anupa/diya: I quite liked the concept of Hara where farmers are connected to resources like banks and insurance companies etc

Just a thought.. farmers are always looking to find the right resources whether at a production to selling level  

If we are saying that we shouldn't eliminate stakeholders from the ecosystem, maybe we can create better accessibility and availability to resources. 

This can probably also built other chains of transaction between other skateboarders.

[3/23/23, 11:24:27 AM] Gary Teh: I believe to focus our attention and efforts, we should shortlist a maximum of 2-3 models we want to test and then vote on one that we will focus our full attention on just validating it

Divergent thinking is good for the variant generation phase, however continued loitering on the divergent phase will just cause enthusiasm and corresponding energy to become dissipated in an undirected fashion. Once the dissipation is done, there will be no more energy left to actually power the business model
[3/23/23, 11:25:58 AM] Gary Teh: Simple analogy, we filled up the car with a full tank of gas. Then we press on the pedal without engaging the gear

The engine spins but the wheels don‚Äôt move

After a few hours we have burned up all the gas and the car remains on the same spot the whole timeü§î
[3/23/23, 11:28:50 AM] Anupa/diya: If we have a process system for phases like discover define develop delivery ..then we can evaluate what goes into what phase
[3/23/23, 11:29:34 AM] Gary Teh: You are the specialist for design thinking.

Are you past the discover phase yet? 

If not, what is missing? üôÇ
[3/23/23, 11:30:21 AM] Anupa/diya: We are just in the discover phase .. I am not a big fan of the double diamond.. it's the easiest to explain.
[3/23/23, 11:31:02 AM] Gary Teh: What are the next steps needed for the discover phase in this project??
[3/23/23, 11:31:18 AM] Anupa/diya: I will add it in the miro.

[3/25/23, 4:34:19 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 you mentioned there was a specific use case in the agriculture producer space that you were very passionate about? 

Want to share it with our group? 

From my perspective, since we operate as a DAO, makes a lot of sense to perhaps focus our attention on projects that at least a few people feel very passionate about than on projects where most members just feel slightly interested about
[3/25/23, 4:37:41 PM] Gary Teh: In traditional startup projects progress relies heavily on availability of VC funding, For DAO projects progress relies heavily on member passion and engagement 

The progress of Dan‚Äôs Artist build community project is a case in point.

[3/27/23, 7:42:59 AM] Gary Teh: I love OEM stuff

I was a importer and exporter of OEM originated from southeast and east Asia back in 2004 when eBay first came to Singapore
[3/27/23, 7:44:14 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Jajaja
[3/27/23, 7:44:27 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Then you know your stuff
[3/27/23, 7:44:29 AM] Gary Teh: Too bad, we did not stick with the business model or further build upon it but pivoted away. 

E-commerce became really huge in Southeast Asia 5 years after we shifted away from the sector into other sectors. All the major e-commerce players you see in that field came into being around 2010

Once again, we were too early ü§£
[3/27/23, 8:26:02 AM] Anupa/diya: Hi Everyone ! Busy Monday!
[3/27/23, 8:42:35 AM] Anupa/diya: From my experience, the pool of small scale producers raw and semi processed are highly underpresented due to the intermediaries. Empowering and mobilizing such communities is a huge task but if it can be done, it can scalable in many different countries.

As there is a huge socio political cultural component in agriculture, there is a large potential for investment. 

However, any project that we decide to do. 

 we has to have 
1. A Strong purpose. What are we trying to solve and why. It has to connect with the principles of Trusight.. equality diversity inclusivity(Gary? ü§£) 

2. Who are the people in the ecosystem 

3. What is the scope, bussiness model 
Analyze the market,customer and science trends future trends 
How will it work and is it working .mvp . Prioritize on top 2 to 3 areas for ideation 
Create _ build_ prototype 
What is the ROI
Validate for market delivery.

How does it work with Tru Sight model 
And etc 

As I see the two main areas 
That could be explored are
1. Producer as the key consumer 
2. Middle men. The certificate providers or the exchanges or cooperative.

Or if there are any more areas.

If we further brainstorm on how we can go forward. If we can settle on a meeting date maybe next week end
[3/27/23, 8:44:31 AM] Anupa/diya: I think we can also take a call on the level of engagement or roles.

If we are really going forward. Maybe we need to open up the project to other people for resources or even list it on the website 

Open for bussiness ü§£
[3/27/23, 8:46:43 AM] Anupa/diya: It will great if define at what point this can be a social experiment to an actual viable project
[3/27/23, 9:13:44 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, the transition from a social experiment to a viable project is when we have figured out a viable business model that all participants are receptive towards
[3/27/23, 9:14:48 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a car as an analogy, until we have figured out the blueprint of a car design that works, everything before that point is just ideation
[3/27/23, 9:19:51 AM] Anupa/diya: Let's say .. do we only apply for investment funds or do we also aim like at research grants for smaller milestones 

Since these projects will be working on a grass root level  . Who ever it is, producer or intermediary, we will have to show qualitative research to show and test the viability
[3/27/23, 9:28:09 AM] Anupa/diya: I will be exporting this chat into a document so we don't lose out on the comments said by everyone
[3/27/23, 9:33:17 AM] Gary Teh: At the early stage, I believe research grants will be more viable

I am not at all familiar with how impact funds operate, perhaps Alessandro might be able to advice
[3/27/23, 9:42:10 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I agree. Most investors would like to see the MVP first.
[3/27/23, 9:44:07 AM] Anupa/diya: @254700187599 if we need to speak to producers for a workshop .. would you know anyone who is willingly
[3/27/23, 9:44:19 AM] Anupa/diya: Or even @971561302188
[3/27/23, 9:45:00 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yes.
[3/27/23, 9:47:45 AM] Anupa/diya: Fab ! If yiu could make a list for the data base.

We can collectively create a database of the various stakeholders.. farmers.. intermediaries..we could potentially speak to

[3/27/23, 10:40:12 AM] Gary Teh: Don‚Äôt thank me. It is the system you should thank üôÇüëç

I am just pointing out the feature of the system

Based on the current issued governance tokens to USDT in reserve (approximately USDT0.004 per token), it‚Äôs equates to USD1 per lead generated 

This amount will either go up or down based on how successful our ongoing efforts to getting to a monetizable model

I am right now in Brazil and hanging out with @554792591729

I will be headed over to Columbia in a few weeks time. I believe @5491125130580 might be doing the same too

@5491125130580 is flying from Buenos Aires to meet up with me in Florianopolis tomorrow 

I believe Martin who caters for House of Balance in Davos Switzerland utilizes cacao from this region

This might be an interesting trade route to explore

He did reach out earlier about raising funds to acquire a cacao farm here in Brazil last month. Haven‚Äôt heard back from him since when I asked for more information on the financial side ü§î
[4/2/23, 7:28:00 AM] Tess walkowski: Hi Gary and tru dao, so I have been traveling in Sierra Nevada where I have been studying cacao and writing about it.  My medium article will be live in a few days and I will start to discuss this.
[4/2/23, 7:28:50 AM] Tess walkowski: I ended up staying with a Kogi family, deep in the mountains where native cacao grows
[4/2/23, 7:29:58 AM] Tess walkowski: They have a harvest coming up, and I would like to buy half if it, and sell this cacao which helps them, and over time we move to a larger farm and help the community get land back.

Helping find buyers for agricultural produce for small producers in developing countries so as to help channel funds back to these communities to build up their facilities
[4/2/23, 7:32:24 AM] Tess walkowski: They could really use solar power , and long long rolls of  pex plus crimpers and tools
[4/2/23, 7:32:39 AM] Gary Teh: How long will you be there for? And which part of South America and you in? 

I will pop by on my way up north 

Let‚Äôs take a look at the facility you are describing while I am there üôÇ

Also how much is the per unit cost of the cacao harvest?

[4/2/23, 7:38:46 AM] Tess walkowski: The farm is up from Rio ancho
[4/2/23, 7:39:02 AM] Tess walkowski: It's a heavy hike the harvest is in early May
[4/2/23, 7:39:38 AM] Tess walkowski: You would need to come with supplies and payment to visit the farm as it is closed a bit to outsiders
[4/2/23, 7:39:44 AM] Gary Teh: Actually pertaining to what @41765737357 proposed about helping bring the surface the stories of how producers utilize sustainable cultivation methods, it might be helpful to conduct an interview with them. 

I know that @554792591729 has been thinking of doing such a filming series

[4/2/23, 7:45:43 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly on the supply side or the demand side as well?

@918017107841 had a lot of experience with the import and export trades out of Africa 

I am aware that @554792591729‚Äôs family has experience with how farms operate here in South America. So does @5511982667030 for larger scale farms
[4/2/23, 7:45:51 AM] Tess walkowski: It's delicate, because they are indigenous in this case.  However that is also the correct way.
[4/2/23, 7:46:16 AM] Gary Teh: That is the circular way to do things ‚òØÔ∏è

I am right now doing an audit of our receipts from subscriptions revenue generated by Edgar (our resident AI)

As of now our DAO USDT5000 that could be readily deployed. 

Tentatively that amount should increase by another USd1000. The exact number will be known once I am done doing the audit

Once we have clarified the terms of financing, let‚Äôs submit this as a proposal for the entire DAO to vote on üôÇüëç

[4/2/23, 5:29:36 PM] Gary Teh: The way I see it, if this is minimal viable transaction works out, our DAO can explore acquisition of farm In South America

As @5511982667030 suggested operating farms will require their own set of logistics

@554792591729 has kindly offered to go visit some of the farms they have on the Brazilian side near the borders of Bolivia. Would be great to go study and understand the operations if we do decide to proceed to phase 2 (acquisition of farm)
[4/2/23, 5:31:58 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 will need your guidance on how our governance model can support this incoming transaction

1 - ensure you @13134136108 make enough so that you can continue your endeavor 

2 - ensure enough goes back to the Colombian community so that they can building their infrastructure to further improve upon their quality of life

3 - ensure enough comes back to our DAO so that we can continue expanding support to more transactions that fit the triple bottom line criteria

From my perspective, in relationship to our DAO, it ties back to our core value of Diversity 

In this case, firstly preserving ecosystem diversity by providing a balance against the further spread of large scale monoculture farming practices 

Secondly Channeling resources back to the village so that they can continue preserving their way of life. This serves to retain cultural diversity in the general ecosystem
[4/6/23, 8:01:03 AM] Anupa/diya: Hello Everyone ! Just reviving our main agenda of the ecoverse
[4/6/23, 8:01:36 AM] Anupa/diya: As we have the bussiness canvas model now, can we collectively start adding the thoughts we had during our call
[4/6/23, 8:02:00 AM] Anupa/diya: Maybe we can schedule after Easter
[4/6/23, 8:04:21 AM] Anupa/diya: Some of the main points 

1. Looking at the supply chain and distribution 
2.certification on the blockchain 
3. Intermediaries 
4. Farmer accessibility to larger markets 

Phygital service that can work across global spaces that will benefit the agro stakeholders 

We can identify the key user.

[4/6/23, 8:17:22 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to me there are three potential business models emerging in this chatroom

1. DAO becoming a financier in this space 
 
2. DAO becoming a logistic provider in this space 

3. DAO becoming a farming operator in this space

I wonder which business model we should focus on when we go about filling up our dedicated business model canvas. Thoughts?
[4/6/23, 8:19:03 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 2
[4/6/23, 8:19:21 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 1
[4/6/23, 8:19:47 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 3
[4/6/23, 8:22:35 AM] Anupa/diya: It all depends on the key user and the purpose. Farmer (what kind) intermediaries or the service providers 

Logistics would be great because accessibility is a huge issue 

Grading plants or Grading digitized systems .
[4/6/23, 8:24:33 AM] Gary Teh: How shall we go about deciding which key user should we focus on?
[4/6/23, 8:26:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Research. Qualitative and quantitative... there has to be a strong validation of why we choose the user. 

What is this problem we are trying to solve .
What are the gaps and challenges 
Everyone had some great points last call
[4/6/23, 8:30:16 AM] Anupa/diya: If we can find a way of doing some ground work research that will be great. @254700187599 @971561302188  can we please look into that if possible .
[4/6/23, 8:32:32 AM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs just lump all we have in mind on to the canvas 

I am sure the ideal user will start surfacing as we start seeing where all the gaps are as the collective insights are inserted 

From my perspective there are the three fits

Team Market fit - social capital
Team Product fit - human capital 
Product Maket fit 

Team in this case is our community 

No point attempting to solve a problem if 

1) no one in our community is familiar with the problem 

2) no one in our community has access to people who are experiencing the problem

3) no one in our community knows how to solve the problem
[4/6/23, 8:32:37 AM] Al√©ksa: Helloi 

Are you looking to acquire a farm?
[4/6/23, 8:33:56 AM] Gary Teh: The immediate context is  exploring how to provide financing to a distributor (@13134136108) looking to procure 50% of an indigenous farms harvest
[4/6/23, 8:35:15 AM] Tess walkowski: Later after organic dao structure is stronger and trust built via smaller contracts, future a farm but that's complicated
[4/6/23, 8:36:35 AM] Tess walkowski: Great points above.  I will write an article about use case for daos soon, focus on farming. Finishing the details on some background articles for cacao to educate users as well.
[4/6/23, 8:36:45 AM] Tess walkowski: This is exciting and glad to be a part
[4/6/23, 8:37:37 AM] Anupa/diya: We currently looking at a collective  purpose that will help us address the key issues at the agro tech community 

We are at the research stage so any insight will be very helpful!!
[4/6/23, 8:38:40 AM] Tess walkowski: I can share my research Ux ui for crowd dao but I want to be a little private if I share research.

[4/6/23, 8:40:36 AM] Gary Teh: This one was setup yesterday 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/canvas
[4/6/23, 8:43:02 AM] Anupa/diya: Whatever is comfortable for you as the research will be open to the community
[4/6/23, 9:10:58 AM] Al√©ksa: that depends  on many factors, it's a  bit difficult to say anything based on this
[4/6/23, 9:11:50 AM] Gary Teh: What are some factors that immediately comes to mind?
[4/6/23, 9:37:29 AM] Al√©ksa: how will the funding be given 
to whom 
from who 
what would be the deal
[4/6/23, 9:51:22 AM] Gary Teh: That is what needs to be explored

Angle 1)

Off the top of my head, funding provided by DAO to either 1) distributors or 2) [small scale farm] farmers  seeking for financing to facilitate buying and selling, growing of agriculture produce

In exchange for financing, the DAO gets a percentage of returns that is generated once the off chain transaction is completed. 

Two types of off chain transactions

    - 1) farmer sold off the goods to distributor 
    - 2) distributor sold off the goods to end buyer
[4/6/23, 9:53:04 AM] Gary Teh: Angle 2) funding from external investor that is past to DAO for a limited period of time to facilitate the underlying transaction described above 

Once the off chain transaction is completed, external investor gets his principle back and some profits 

DAO retains some percentage of the returns for facilitating the transaction
[4/6/23, 10:09:33 AM] Anupa/diya: Angle outcome... is it for global farming community of certain produce like coffee or wheat or specific
[4/6/23, 10:11:44 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective looking at the community market fit perspective, it‚Äôs really which market (type of farmers/distributors) our community has access to 

The DAO in this case plays a more passive role, it‚Äôs not the deal maker but the deal taker
[4/6/23, 10:14:02 AM] Anupa/diya: If we had some perspective of Australia and South East Asia would also be good
[4/6/23, 10:14:12 AM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[4/6/23, 10:14:49 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Will do.
[4/6/23, 10:15:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[4/6/23, 10:16:39 AM] Gary Teh: Another way to phrase it

I see we have a DAO (community of people)

I see there is a market

I am thinking what is the easiest way our DAO can establish a foothold in that market and profit from it in a sustainable manner to both the local community and the environment
[4/6/23, 10:17:50 AM] Gary Teh: If there is no way our DAO can establish a foothold in that market, then all our discussions and research conducted here within this space will just at best remain theoretical
[4/7/23, 7:01:06 AM] Al√©ksa: In order for the DAO to invest, needs to have a legal entity, be KYC/AML compliant, need to have a contract. 

Depending on the legal status of the farm, it can be okay, or can be a securities problem as you're investing because you expect some return. 

In addition to that, depending on the jurisdiction, you might need to be an accredited investor to make this type of investment. 

I dont understand fully angle #2.
[4/7/23, 7:12:44 AM] Tess walkowski: I think this type provides a good test use case for making a dao function.
[4/7/23, 7:13:34 AM] Tess walkowski: .....in this example....it's a family who needs farming supplies ....
[4/7/23, 7:14:03 AM] Tess walkowski: Money is less important to them that preserving their culture and taking care of their community
[4/7/23, 7:14:48 AM] Tess walkowski: ....let's say this works ....
[4/7/23, 7:15:28 AM] Tess walkowski: There is another thing which happens as this evolves....
[4/7/23, 7:15:54 AM] Tess walkowski: Does the dao put a stamp of approval on my cacao for example
[4/7/23, 7:16:45 AM] Tess walkowski: It's ethical.   There are two other companies who came up in my research.  And they changed the world.
[4/7/23, 7:17:38 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao beans were once considered so valuable they were used for currency
[4/7/23, 7:24:17 AM] Anupa/diya: Well most buyers need recognized certifications. The blockchain can be used for authentication and Traceability

[4/7/23, 7:24:32 AM] Anupa/diya: As a support
[4/7/23, 7:24:46 AM] Anupa/diya: In the past we have focused on coffee as well.
[4/7/23, 7:24:49 AM] Tess walkowski: This comes in time..... And that's a bit the issue honestly
[4/7/23, 7:25:03 AM] Tess walkowski: There is a monopoly in food
[4/7/23, 7:25:24 AM] Tess walkowski: The control means a few major companies have the world's supply.
[4/7/23, 7:25:26 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: This would be an issue for small scale individual farms in africa.
[4/7/23, 7:25:32 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee is another example
[4/7/23, 7:25:40 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes and it's a problem!!!!
[4/7/23, 7:25:54 AM] Tess walkowski: First off coffee is native to Africa not here
[4/7/23, 7:26:29 AM] Tess walkowski: It is a serious issue bc it means people don't get food sovereignty
[4/7/23, 7:26:48 AM] Anupa/diya: We haven't really looked at a specific produce that we will be targeting
[4/7/23, 7:27:03 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee and cacao are dry and easier
[4/7/23, 7:27:11 AM] Tess walkowski: Produce ....whoa
[4/7/23, 7:27:21 AM] Tess walkowski: Be a superhero take that on
[4/7/23, 7:27:21 AM] Anupa/diya: So that's where the solution comes in how can be build a solution that looks into local adoption.

This is my question

‚ÄúWhat is the most suitable legal structure for a DAO that handles import and export of agricultural produce if I want to incorporate in Switzerland?‚Äù

This is its answer 

If you want to incorporate a DAO in Switzerland to handle the import and export of agricultural produce, the most suitable legal structure will depend on various factors, including the size of the organization, the level of liability protection you require, and the governance structure of the DAO.

Here are three possible legal structures for a DAO that handles the import and export of agricultural produce in Switzerland:

1. Limited Liability Company (LLC): An LLC is a popular legal structure for a DAO as it provides limited liability protection to its members while allowing them to participate in the management of the organization. An LLC also offers flexibility in its organizational structure, as members can elect a board of directors or manage the organization themselves.

2. Cooperative: A cooperative is another legal structure that is popular for DAOs in Switzerland. It allows members to join together to pursue a common economic goal, in this case, the import and export of agricultural produce. Members typically have equal voting rights, and profits are distributed among members based on their contribution to the cooperative.

3. Association: An association is a legal structure that is commonly used to incorporate non-profit organizations in Switzerland. It is suitable for a DAO that aims to promote a social cause, such as sustainable agriculture. Associations have a democratic organizational structure with a board of directors elected by the members. Profit-making activities are limited, but an association can generate income from the sale of goods or services related to the organization's purpose.

It is crucial to seek legal advice to determine the most suitable legal structure for your DAO based on your specific requirements and objectives.

[4/7/23, 11:13:38 AM] Vlatko Gigov: that can be easily done through a business introducers agreement through a rev share. Check out unit.network model of having to deposit collateral in order to be creditworthy for next rounds of financing or business opportunity‚Ä¶
[4/7/23, 11:13:48 AM] Gary Teh: Was just consulting ChatGpt the same.

My question

‚ÄúWhat is the most suitable organization type to choose when incorporating a DAO in Switzerland, if the goal is to handle import and exports of agricultural produce from South America and Africa to Europe? 

If we are expecting the size of our organization to be more than 10000 members in the future and they are spread around the world?‚Äù

It‚Äôs answer 

‚ÄúIf you are planning to incorporate a DAO in Switzerland with the goal of handling import and exports of agricultural produce from South America and Africa to Europe, and you are expecting the size of your organization to be more than 10000 members in the future and they are spread around the world, a Cooperative legal structure will be the most suitable organization type. 

Here's why:

1. Democratic governance: The cooperative structure enables a democratic organizational structure, where the members have equal voting rights and participate in the management of the organization. This is crucial in a DAO, where members of the community are the decision-makers and have the power to vote on projects, proposals, and distributions of funds.

2. Limited liability: Members of a Cooperative have limited liability protection, which means they are not personally liable for the DAO's debts or obligations. This protects the members' assets in case of legal actions against the DAO.

3. Economic participation: The Cooperative legal structure promotes economic participation of its members. Members participate in the profits or losses of the DAO based on the amount of contributions they have made to the DAO.

4. Robust legal structure: The Swiss cooperative law has a robust legal structure, which provides regulatory certainty, and facilitates capital-raising and the expansion of the DAO. As a result, a Cooperative can handle complex import and export activities, which require significant capital-raising to purchase and transport large amounts of agricultural produce.

5. Global reach: The cooperative structure can be established internationally, serving its members in different parts of the world. A cooperative can provide services, facilities, and resources to its members regardless of their geographical location.

It is important to seek legal advice when incorporating a DAO in Switzerland to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Additionally, it is essential to have a clear governance framework, operations plan, and community management system to manage a DAO, especially with a large number of members.

I have witnessed this with tokenization of real estate too. 

There is no recognition of tokens as legal ownership.
So startups have to form SPVs owned by the token holders. The certificate of title is owned by the SPV and held by a custodian.

I believe this is a good time to  start figuring out the formal incorporation of our DAO. 

This is also most especially true since our DAO has already started generating revenue from Edgar and once the tokenomics is defined with GetData Inc, revenue from that direction too

It is time to get serious

That property in the desert once acquired needs to go under the ownership of our DAO. So definitely the need to sort out our incorporation needs to be dealt with very soon
[4/7/23, 11:30:26 AM] Gary Teh: So we can either acquire the piece of land in the desert of Arizona/New Mexico or

This is because the supply chain will be very different for coffee, shea butter and cacao

[4/8/23, 10:15:05 PM] Gary Teh: Was checking with ChatGpt on KYC today to endures today for our DAO and this was what it suggested 

Starting to realize it is quite good for providing options when dealing with policy related matters 

KYC (Know Your Customer) is a process used globally to verify the identity of customers and assess the potential risks of illegal intentions such as money laundering or terrorist financing. KYC is already mandatory for financial institutions and other regulated entities, but it is relatively new in DAOs. Here are some ways that KYC can be performed for DAOs:

1. Verification of personal data: DAOs can require members or participants to provide scanned copies of their IDs or passports, proof of address, social security numbers, or other relevant personal information to meet KYC requirements. For instance, an independent third party can perform the KYC process, such as a digital identity verification platform, a token sale platform, or an exchange.

2. Smart Contract Verification: DAOs can deploy smart contracts that can verify users' identity and make sure that all users comply with the KYC regulations using the principles of self-sovereign identity. This approach requires users to have a digital ID, which consists of their personal data, and sensitive biometrics through the use of blockchain technology.

3. Reputation Verification: Reputation verification involves creating a rating system, where users are rated based on their past transactions and adherence to certain terms and conditions set by the DAO. Although this works slightly differently than traditional KYC, it still enables DAOs to minimize risks by avoiding users with bad reputation scores from joining the DAO.

It is crucial always to seek legal advice from an expert in the field since the regulatory paradigm for DAOs is consistently evolving, and a specific regulator may apply KYC regulations in a unique way. Educating members on KYC best practices through community engagement is also crucial for the DAO community to maintain regulatory compliance.
[4/9/23, 8:29:01 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 helped setup a dinner last night with a farm owner. He and his wife set everything up from scratch

One of the key problems he surfaced were that some agricultural produces like tangerine do not have a global commodity price (like for example coffee beans)

As such the prices middle men (what Satheesh call aggregators) quote them and other small scale farmers can be wildly volatile 

I now get a better sense of the problem that @254700187599 and @918017107841 described. As well as the concern that @19514467219 surfaced earlier during our last FaceTime conversation 

There might in fact be demand for an oracle solution as suggested by @918017107841 and @5491125130580
[4/9/23, 8:29:41 AM] Gary Teh: I prompted ChatGpt on the best strategy to build and roll out such a framework. This is its response 


Implementing and rolling out a blockchain-based oracle for agricultural product prices that do not have a commodity market can be a complex and technical task that requires careful planning, execution, and collaboration amongst the DAO members. Here's a strategy that can be employed:

1. Identify Requirements: Define the requirements that the oracle must meet to provide accurate and reliable data. List factors like market demand, product variety, supply factors such as input costs, seasonality, transportation, and storage costs.

2. Explore Existing Tools: Explore existing oracle platforms available in the market that can provide an off-the-shelf solution. Solutions like Chainlink, Band Protocol, Tellor among others can be used with modifications.

3. Design Oracle Architecture: Design the oracle's architecture that aligns with the requirements identified in step one, either by modifying the existing platforms or by building a new one. Using smart contracts to automate the workflow and data inputs can improve reliability and the robustness of the oracle.

4. Develop the Oracle: Developers can build and test the oracle based on the requirements set in step 1.

5. Pilot Study: Conduct a pilot study on a small scale to test the effectiveness of the oracle in providing reliable and accurate data.

6. Deploy and Monitor: Deploy the oracle on a large scale and monitor its effectiveness to ensure that it meets the expected requirements. Apart from active monitoring, regular feedback from users can help improve the oracle.

7. Marketing and Outreach: Promote the use of the oracle with stakeholders who can provide value from its use, such as those in agro-production, agro-insurance, government agencies or digital marketplaces. Active collaboration with stakeholders in the agricultural value chain is also critical.

8. Regular Maintenance and Upgrades: Regular maintenance must be conducted oracles to identify issues, resolve errors, and update the oracle's performance, reliability, and accuracy.

In summary, rolling out a blockchain-based oracle for agricultural product prices requires a systematic approach, a technically sound development team, and an experienced advisory team. The use of existing solutions, smart contracts, feedback from users, and stakeholder collaboration can contribute to the success of the oracle. Finally, a well-established maintenance schedule will help maintain performance and reliability over time.

[4/9/23, 8:34:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Read the open veins of Latin America by Edward galeono
[4/9/23, 8:45:08 AM] Gary Teh: Great inputs will add that to my reading list
[4/9/23, 8:46:11 AM] Tess walkowski: There are major major issues in produce that are revolutionary to address
[4/9/23, 8:46:19 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 and @918017107841 pertaining to the roles required for this project of which the initial phase is focused on providing such an oracle solution. These are the recommended roles proposed by ChatGpt 

The implementation and rollout of a blockchain-based oracle for agriculture product prices that do not have a commodity market can require the following roles:

1. Project Manager: Coordinates the different activities involved in the project, communicates with the project team and DAO members, and ensures timeliness and the successful execution of project milestones.

2. Technical Lead: The person responsible for designing the oracle architecture and leading technical development activities.

3. Smart Contract Developer: Develops the smart contracts that will manage the data submitted to, and extracted from, the blockchain-based oracle.

4. Data Architect: Responsible for designing the metadata format for the data that will be recorded on the blockchain.

5. Blockchain Developer: Builds and integrates the blockchain-based oracle into the eventual platform for its use by stakeholders.

6. Quality Assurance Analyst: Implement quality control procedures, identifying issues and resolving them, and verifying that oracle results are accurate and consistent.

7. Outreach Coordinator: Responsible for coordinating promotion activities, which include pitching the oracle to potential users, writing and pitching guest posts, and engaging with those who could benefit from the new system.

8. Data Analyst: Analyze and optimize data to the maximum benefit of the interested parties.

9. Agriculture Expert: Those with experience in agriculture that can provide insights regarding the most important data points to record and how to present the data best.

10. Marketing Expert: The person responsible for designing and executing effective marketing campaigns for the resulting data.

The defined roles above are examples but will differ depending on the DAO's capacity, requirements, and goals. Coordination and communication among the roles are essential for the efficient functioning of the blockchain-based oracle. Each team member should have an excellent understanding of the scope of the work and how to accomplish it to ensure the project's overall success.

[4/9/23, 9:21:47 AM] Anupa/diya: Pricing is one of the key issues. This is an area which can attract producers at any level in any country with any produce. 

I wonder if this is a "narrative" that would attract the investors easily rather than concentrating on particular produce and country. 

With the pricing with can also look into @19514467219 idea of the certification
[4/9/23, 9:55:59 AM] Gary Teh: Prompt ChatGpt for that? Its seems to have a lot of content. 

What it lacks is the ability to execute the narratives, plans and strategy in the real world. That is where I believe humans are a nice complement.
[4/10/23, 8:50:16 PM] Gary Teh: Prompt to ChatGpt.

Our DAO‚Äôs purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good process to acquire and onboard small scale farmers to our DAO‚Äôs onchain oracle for agricultural product?
[4/10/23, 8:50:36 PM] Gary Teh: Response 

To acquire and onboard small scale farmers to our DAO's onchain oracle for agricultural products, a good process that could be followed is:

1. Identifying and Mapping farmers: Conduct a survey of small-scale farmers in the area or region of the DAO's presence and categorize them based on different factors like location, types of produce, and other details relevant to the DAO's goals.

2. Define Membership Criteria: Establish criteria for farmers to be eligible for onboarding, including the use of sustainable farming practices, compliance with local regulations, and willingness to share necessary data, such as planting and harvest times, yield volume, and others.

3. Set up an application process: Create an application process, where farmers can apply by submitting their farm's details, farming practices, and willingness to share data with our DAO.

4. Validate and verify data: On verification, farmers' details can be uploaded to our DAO's on-chain oracle, creating a decentralized and immutable record of their farming practices.

5. Farmer Education: Educate farmers on how to use the on-chain oracle and the importance of sharing accurate data while also understanding the rewards of the platform.

6. Provision of incentives: To attract farmers and ensure their consistent participation, provide some incentives to farmers, such as seed capital for farming, supply chain access, and contract discounts. 

7. Create network for farmers: Facilitate a network of small-scale farmers who are part of DAO to collaborate, learn from each other, and benefit from best practices shared in the network.

By following these steps, our DAO can create a curated and transparent on-chain record of small-scale farmers who are dedicated to best farming practices in the region, promoting the 'verifiable truth' of the DAO. It also ensures the integrity of the supply chain, supports farm communities, and encourages the development of sustainable farming practices. Additionally, this process addresses the centralization of power in the agriculture industry and supports local small-scale farmers, upholding our DAO's values of autonomy, integrity, and diversity towards building a better world based on fundamental truth.
[4/10/23, 8:52:14 PM] Tess walkowski: I like that. And I like how it's wide net and about more farms
[4/10/23, 8:52:25 PM] Gary Teh: Prompt to ChatGpt

Our DAO‚Äôs purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good process to monetize our DAO‚Äôs onchain oracle which provides agricultural product pricing data from small scale farmers?
[4/10/23, 8:52:38 PM] Gary Teh: Response 

To monetize our DAO's on-chain oracle, which provides agricultural product pricing data from small-scale farmers, a good process could be:

1. Determine the Market: Conduct research and gather insights on the target market that requires the pricing data, such as food companies, retailers, local cooperatives, and other cooperatives.

2. Define Data Inputs: Establish the data inputs required, ensuring they are accurate, standardized, and easily accessible.

3. Create A Subscription Based Service: Create a subscription-based service with different pricing tiers for different levels of data access to our DAO's oracle. 

4. Marketing and Sales: Develop marketing and sales strategies to raise awareness of our DAO's on-chain oracle's price data offerings.

5. Partnerships: Seek partnerships with food companies, retailers, cooperatives and other organizations who may benefit from our on-chain oracle's price data.

6. Develop Tools: Create tools to integrate our on-chain oracle's price data, making it easy for business partners to access the data.

7. Payment Methods: Provide payment methods for business partners, including stable coins or other digital assets compatible with the blockchain protocol.

By implementing these steps, our DAO can monetize the data generated by our on-chain oracle, creating a new revenue stream for the DAO while also helping small-scale farmers receive honest payment for their produce. It also supports businesses transparency in their pricing, protecting end-users' interests and saving the administrative costs of sourcing quality produce. In addition, this process aligns with your DAO's values of verifiable truth, autonomy, integrity, and diversity, creating a more equitable and fair agricultural ecosystem.
[4/10/23, 8:53:28 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean it's a dream.
[4/10/23, 8:55:03 PM] Gary Teh: Our DAO‚Äôs purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is the best geographical location to focus on for building our DAO‚Äôs onchain oracle for small scale farmers agriculture produce pricing data? Answer in less than 100 words
[4/10/23, 8:55:10 PM] Gary Teh: The best geographic location for our DAO's on-chain oracle for small-scale farmers agriculture produce pricing data would be a region or country that has a strong agricultural industry with many small-scale farmers growing various crops, supportive government policies, existing logistics and supply chain infrastructure, suitable climate conditions for farming practices, and cultural appropriateness. Countries such as India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Indonesia have a considerable number of small-scale farmers and emerging tech sectors, thus making them viable locations to focus on building our DAO's on-chain oracle.
[4/10/23, 8:59:14 PM] Gary Teh: @971561302188 and @254700187599 

If what ChatGpt mentioned is true both of you will be playing very critical roles in this project
[4/10/23, 9:19:48 PM] Gary Teh: To bootstrap an oracle for small-scale farmers product pricing data in Kenya and Nigeria, the following steps could be followed:

1. Identify Farmers' Pain Points: First, identify the primary pain points farmers face concerning product pricing, emphasizing transparency and fairness to solicit their buy-in.

2. Define Data Inputs: Define the required data inputs, ensuring they are relevant, accurate, and standardized, setting up a reliable source of information for farmers and other parties involved in the agriculture supply chain.

3. Develop an MVP: Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the essential features and functionalities for the oracle for small-scale farmers' product pricing data in both countries.

4. Partner with Agricultural Cooperatives: Partner with established agricultural cooperatives representing small-scale farmers to gain easy access to a relevant audience.

5. Establish Trust: Establish trust with farmers and other stakeholders involved in the agriculture supply chain, emphasizing regular interaction with key players to guarantee fair and accurate pricing data.

6. Engage with Tech Communities: Engage with the tech communities in both countries, innovators, and entrepreneurs to promote awareness of the oracle and invite collaboration to advance technology adoption.

7. Leverage Technology: Leverage technological solutions such as blockchain and smart contracts to automate transactions, improve trustworthiness, accuracy, and the security of the data.

8. Promote Community Building: Promote community building by incentivizing participation by offering rewards and incentives to farmers for sharing their data inventory.

9. Revenue Models: Consider feasible revenue models such as subscription-based services, giving access to premium data inputs or charging a fee based on the transaction value.

By following these steps, it will be possible to establish viable oracles for small-scale farmers' product pricing data in both Kenya and Nigeria. The Oracle will help scale up transparency and fair pricing along the agriculture supply chain, minimizing wastage, and fostering trust among different players, promoting overall growth within the sector.

How do we bootstrap an oracle solution for agricultural product pricing data of small farmers?

Should we focus on just one small niche first or go after the entire market initially?
[4/11/23, 3:06:09 PM] Gary Teh: To bootstrap an oracle solution for agricultural product pricing data for small farmers, organizations with the purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth could follow the following steps:

1. Identify Farmers' Pain Points: Identify the primary pain points experienced by small-scale farmers concerning product pricing and emphasize the need for transparency and fairness to gain their buy-in.

2. Define Data Inputs and Outputs: Define relevant, accurate, and standardized data inputs, ensuring they are readily available to the small-scale farmers, and define outputs such as real-time price information and price trends.

3. Establish Partnerships with Cooperatives: Establish partnerships with agricultural cooperatives, associations, entities working closely with small-scale farmers, local NGOs and other stakeholders in the agricultural industry to easily access a wide range of farmers and their produce.

4. Develop a Minimum Viable Product: Develop and test a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes several functionalities such as tracking product pricing data, establishing reporting and compliance rules, and defining roles allowed to input and update data.

5. Leverage Technology: Leverage technology using blockchain or smart contracts for secure traceability, transparency, and to establish trust between participants.

6. Establish Data Verification: Develop robust data verification procedures for any data submitted to ensure that it is valid, accurate, and tamper-proof.

7. Focus on User Experience: Focus on the user interface and overall user experience by continually engaging with farmers to ensure that the MVP is intuitive and straightforward to use.

8. Promote Community Building: Promote community building by incentivizing farmers for participating in the oracle and encouraging groups to regularly input data.

9. Evaluate Market Dynamics and Plan for Scalability: Evaluate market dynamics and determine the best course of action concerning focus- starting with a small niche or going after the entire market initially and plan for scalability based on findings. 

Overall, the best approach would depend on the organization's resources, objectives, and market conditions. Starting with a small niche could be a sound strategy for validating the oracle's functionality, building trust with users, and optimizing workflows while keeping operating costs low. Once the MVP is optimized based on user feedback, it can be expanded to other regions and markets. Alternatively, going after the entire market initially could speed up the scale-up process but may require significant resources and infrastructure to meet demand. The organizations should consider all aspects before deciding on the course of action.

[4/13/23, 7:34:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't want to be a naysayer in this project.... I think an oracle that verifies prices in amazing.....however I don't think this hits the farmers pain point.   I deal with farmers who are not in the commercial market, and the farmers are not high income.
[4/13/23, 7:35:26 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't think we have zeroed in enough on a pain point to work effective, and what we are looking at is enormous in trying to succeed it
[4/13/23, 7:36:28 AM] Tess walkowski: I think effort would best be spent else where.  I think it would be better to think about a dao as a sales portal.

[4/13/23, 9:43:18 AM] Tess walkowski: We would learn from this and reable to restructure
[4/13/23, 9:44:07 AM] Tess walkowski: But seeing as the 3 names products were stronger cacao and coffee and Shea and we have multiple countries in this group.
[4/13/23, 9:44:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Is we have many options to research and execute a trade
[4/13/23, 9:44:52 AM] Tess walkowski: Ie cololmbi to Europe  Brazil to USA etc etc
[4/13/23, 9:45:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Use research to decide
[4/13/23, 9:45:50 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: For trading you onboard sellers and buyers and you start to collect data.
[4/13/23, 9:51:53 AM] Gary Teh: Our DAO has USDT 7000++ in our treasury more than enough to test a single end to end transaction.
[4/13/23, 9:52:41 AM] Gary Teh: Once this poll ends, I would propose we surface the financing of the cacao transaction in the town hall
[4/13/23, 10:49:38 AM] Peter Peng: ‚ÄéYou removed Peter Peng
[4/13/23, 6:05:37 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: There are providers of this in the market. I think tridge is one of them.
[4/13/23, 6:08:55 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: We can leverage on them in the meantime. That is as we execute the trading.
[4/13/23, 6:10:34 PM] Tess walkowski: I think the dao would benefit extremely from doing a single trade to start
[4/13/23, 6:10:48 PM] Tess walkowski: And it sets an example for a dao
[4/13/23, 6:11:08 PM] Tess walkowski: With a very powerful use case.
[4/13/23, 6:11:34 PM] Tess walkowski: And scalable.
[4/13/23, 6:11:50 PM] Tess walkowski: How many people are we in this work group.
[4/13/23, 6:22:10 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I think so too. It will provide some key learnings that can be used to fine tune the implementation.
[4/13/23, 6:25:46 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Also, as the seasons of some of the produce differ, we might have a much easier time introducing new targets.
[4/13/23, 11:38:04 PM] Anita Lamprecht: ‚ÄéAnita Lamprecht left
[4/14/23, 7:33:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Is there another Ux / Ui or scrum agile person in group?
[4/14/23, 7:34:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Once we have an answer we have enough members to use as a research base to get some user research done.    Which allows us to zero into our pain points.
[4/14/23, 7:35:36 AM] Tess walkowski: What about a nonprofit as well....?
[4/14/23, 8:23:03 AM] Gary Teh: If you can find nonprofits that are willing to provide grants to TrueSight DAO by all means we are open to having them added to our list in exchange for governance tokens.
[4/14/23, 8:46:17 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Today I have the talk with the ton folks.. I will came with some news
[4/14/23, 4:19:53 PM] Gary Teh: Came up with first version of our white paper. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#

Feels a little clunky attempting to resolve how such kinds of business model traditional works with decentralized models.

Let‚Äôs close out this poll by end of today (Sunday) üôÇüëç
[4/16/23, 4:18:25 PM] Tess walkowski: Well it looks like there are six votes from 20 people
[4/16/23, 7:41:15 PM] Gary Teh: I would treat none voters as having abdicated their right to vote and help decide once the time limit is up.
[4/17/23, 3:43:11 AM] Gary Teh: And it‚Äôs done. Next decision to be made the trade route to focus on.

[4/17/23, 10:11:32 AM] Tess walkowski: None of my stuff has permits
[4/17/23, 10:14:27 AM] Gary Teh: You mean you can‚Äôt export the cacao without the permits?
[4/17/23, 10:19:15 AM] Gary Teh: How do you plan on getting the permits?
[4/17/23, 10:49:24 AM] Gary Teh: Also which port are you planning to do your exports of the cacao from?
[4/17/23, 10:49:32 AM] Gary Teh: Bump
[4/17/23, 2:16:53 PM] Tess walkowski: I am carrying it in my suitcase and starting so micro.  I will buy 25-50 lbs
[4/17/23, 2:17:24 PM] Tess walkowski: Barranquilla is my nearest port.
[4/17/23, 2:17:52 PM] Tess walkowski: I don't think we have to choose yet.  Brasil vs Colombia
[4/17/23, 2:18:07 PM] Tess walkowski: It can be determined by regulations etc.
[4/17/23, 2:19:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Am learning about the USDA and what I need to do to pass certification
[4/17/23, 2:20:11 PM] Tess walkowski: This is one of the major issues affecting smaller farms
[4/17/23, 2:20:21 PM] Tess walkowski: It will hit on all food same issues
[4/17/23, 4:44:09 PM] Gary Teh: It‚Äôs mainly spending time finding and then reading through regulations. It‚Äôs not rocket science 

I remember my military ex-officer who cofounded and sold a startup really spent time reading through all the regulations in Morocco where they wanted to setup a manufacturing plant for their mini-scooters. He was also the one who spent time figuring out how to manufacture and import mini-scooters from China into USA to scale it.

From my perspective, mentally by default delegating all stuff to specialist before even attempting to spend time mentally going through and understanding a process end to end or perhaps even to the extend of rolling up your sleeves and getting hands dirty with it, is just laziness in disguise. 

All the really strong engineers in my network that went on to successfully founding and exiting tech startup all share this same cognitive trait. That mental grit. 

Or as the VP of product described, when I was hunting down the triggers that cause anxiety amongst teachers to get them to convert to become app users, the tenacity that a blood hound exhibits when following the scent of the blood all the to it‚Äôs logical conclusion
[4/17/23, 4:48:12 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 By the way Hero who is in the hammock next to me mentioned there is this very famous Japanese cacao hunter who hunts for cacao internationally.

She managed to find some of the best cacaos in Colombia by visiting the tribes seems you might have chanced upon the same source as she did. 

Have you gone ahead to transact with the tribes yet? 

When is harvesting going to being

I was reading up on the cacao supply chain just now. Seems there are quite a few steps between raw cacao and chocolate. Are you bringing in cacao fruits or are you bringing cacao liquor across the border of the US?
[4/17/23, 4:48:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[4/17/23, 4:48:56 PM] Tess walkowski: I can send some more writings on cacao
[4/17/23, 4:49:06 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes it's complicated.
[4/17/23, 4:49:35 PM] Gary Teh: Which step in the supply chain are you trying to ‚Äújack‚Äù into??
[4/17/23, 4:49:37 PM] Tess walkowski: This harvest comes after the rain which comes ....in a few days or a week ...
[4/17/23, 4:50:45 PM] Gary Teh: I should be in Columbia leticia by the 25th

I need to fly out of bogota on the 2nd

So I might have a few days in between 

How easy is it to arrange two days in and out of the indigenous camp?
[4/17/23, 4:50:50 PM] Tess walkowski: Honestly, I might not be able to achieve my goals right off the bat
[4/17/23, 4:51:26 PM] Gary Teh: You will either need permits or know someone from the ports to help you get ‚Äúcleared‚Äù
[4/17/23, 4:51:30 PM] Tess walkowski: If you want to come camp with them two nights to learn I can arrange for you or a group
[4/17/23, 4:51:51 PM] Gary Teh: I am just by myself 

Where is the closest airport?
[4/17/23, 4:51:54 PM] Tess walkowski: I will likely have to work with someone a little more established than my friends
[4/17/23, 4:52:15 PM] Tess walkowski: It's hard to get to but it's the experience of a life time
[4/17/23, 4:52:36 PM] Tess walkowski: It's up from a city called rio ancho.
[4/17/23, 4:52:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Santa Marta is the nearest airport.
[4/17/23, 4:53:10 PM] Tess walkowski: I am writing an article about their life style and culture
[4/17/23, 4:53:16 PM] Gary Teh: How many hours does it take to get in?
[4/17/23, 4:53:38 PM] Tess walkowski: 2.5 in cab from Santa
[4/17/23, 4:53:46 PM] Tess walkowski: Going up about two hours
[4/17/23, 4:54:06 PM] Tess walkowski: And money for supplies for the family
[4/17/23, 4:55:17 PM] Tess walkowski: I would solve the issue I have by being patient and going official getting papers which in time means a factory
[4/17/23, 4:55:57 PM] Tess walkowski: There are bigger indigenous producers they would probably be easier to certify.
[4/17/23, 4:56:12 PM] Tess walkowski: But I know I will work with this family.
[4/17/23, 4:56:31 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Not that bad. I thought it would have taken longer. 

I have enough time to spend one night 

Would that work?
[4/17/23, 4:56:37 PM] Tess walkowski: Can mail you some of my writing if anyone is interested.
[4/17/23, 4:57:26 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean one night there is ok, it just is probably hard to expect to get there all the way up
[4/17/23, 4:57:42 PM] Tess walkowski: Do you know your date yet?
[4/17/23, 4:58:19 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah, spend sometime to figure out how to incorporate a company in Colombia 

We will need that legal entity if we want to handle certifications and exporting from property 

I have been checking the same for Brazil this entire afternoon
[4/17/23, 4:59:19 PM] Tess walkowski: And then a 1.5 walkn
[4/17/23, 4:59:29 PM] Tess walkowski: These are the pressing issues
[4/17/23, 4:59:41 PM] Tess walkowski: I am open to work with Brazil as well.
[4/17/23, 5:00:02 PM] Tess walkowski: I feel this is scalable and the same model and issue with cacao applies
[4/17/23, 5:00:28 PM] Tess walkowski: And no cacao is not chocolate, it the step before chocolate liquor
[4/17/23, 5:00:39 PM] Gary Teh: I know the boat takes 7 days to get to Tabatinga. I will need to figure out the proper procedure to cross the borders to leticia 

So I should factor in a day before I fly out of that of leticia upon my arrival at the borders
[4/17/23, 5:01:01 PM] Tess walkowski: It's cocao mass and the cacao butter
[4/17/23, 5:01:10 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware Baha‚Äôi region in Brazil produces cacao. Their chocolate taste good
[4/17/23, 5:01:37 PM] Gary Teh: I was there with @5511982667030  back in 2017
[4/17/23, 5:01:42 PM] Tess walkowski: We want to look for criolla and sustainable harvest
[4/17/23, 5:01:56 PM] Gary Teh: What is criolla??
[4/17/23, 5:02:08 PM] Tess walkowski: It's the type of bean
[4/17/23, 5:02:30 PM] Tess walkowski: The origin tree
[4/17/23, 5:02:39 PM] Tess walkowski: Very likely in Brasil too
[4/17/23, 5:02:59 PM] Tess walkowski: Criollas are not in the market .... They make up only 2 percent
[4/17/23, 5:03:36 PM] Gary Teh: I would propose we just focus on one commodity type first initially. Since the paperwork and logistics are vastly different 

Speaking of which‚Ä¶ bump on this poll
[4/18/23, 6:06:23 AM] Tess walkowski: Do you have an email?   I can send you the chocolate details and to any one who is interested.
[4/18/23, 6:06:51 AM] Tess walkowski: The second article is in progress, as are the ones about the indigenous but it answers the whys

[4/18/23, 6:23:41 AM] Tess walkowski: It's not impossible to import it's that things have to clear customs and papers be filled out.  It's a USDA permit thing
[4/18/23, 6:23:59 AM] Tess walkowski: Which is also why small scale won't work.
[4/18/23, 6:24:39 AM] Tess walkowski: Any of the three stated products, I sell in my small business Shea, coffee cacao
[4/18/23, 9:41:15 AM] Gary Teh: Garyjob@gmail.com

[4/18/23, 9:46:27 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @13134136108 

With permission from @14153000019. 

Allow me to make a request.

Would you mind compiling something that includes the process, opportunity and challenges for this?

And then we can brainstorm and share ideas on the concerns and help fine tune the business process.
[4/18/23, 9:47:44 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: We have a lot of information and i am geographically stumped. The ideation is proving difficult.
[4/18/23, 9:53:50 AM] Gary Teh: Please üôÇüôè
[4/18/23, 9:54:05 AM] Gary Teh: Could you explain what you meant by geographically stumped?
[4/18/23, 9:59:57 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yeah. The locations mentionedüòÑ

Maybe a list would help of the probable farms and their locations.

To enable us to map out the region of target.
[4/18/23, 10:02:07 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! That is something I was meaning to ask as well
[4/18/23, 10:02:41 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Also for us to know the ports, the jurisdictions and jurisdictional requirements. Other variables for risk analysis etc. 

Also, what other externalities or potential products we can couple over time. All that. 

For us to capture the image well.
[4/18/23, 10:05:53 AM] Gary Teh: Are you referring to Colombia specifically where @13134136108 is operating is trying to setup a base or in general every location we are seeking to setup a base?
[4/18/23, 10:07:54 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: For @13134136108 first.
As we agreed to start somewhere and do an actual test.

For every base, i guess we'll capture that overtime, right?
[4/18/23, 10:09:18 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! ü§©

She has also already figured out how to clear the ports for up to 10kg of shipping 

Also we have figured out how to off-ramp USDT cryptocurrency sent her way to Nigeria for purchase of the raw materials

Seems the Lagos, Nigeria is the furthest along in terms of a source of supply with good visibility 

Let‚Äôs submit your vote for this poll if you haven‚Äôt already and conclude on which initial commodity we should focus on
[4/18/23, 1:37:06 PM] Gary Teh: Prompted ChatGpt with this 

TrueSight DAO is founded with the purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity 

EcoVerse21 is a project of our DAO, it‚Äôs goal is to pre-purchase agricultural produce from marginalized small scale farmers for resale to international buyers 

During the course of business it might engage a person to undertake this pre-purchase and resale on its behalf in real life 

Right now TrueSight DAO and EcoVerse21 are not legally registered entities in real life 

Propose a contract that the person engaged to conduct the pre-purchase and resale can sign to protect the interest of TrueSight DAO within the scope of EcoVerse21

Also propose in the contract recourse that a governor of TrueSight DAO can undertake in case person undertaking the transaction renegades on agreement

Make sure to state that the remuneration for undertaking the task paid out to person will be made in the form of governance tokens in our DAO

[4/21/23, 11:22:00 AM] Gary Teh: After observing Jorge and listening to Marcus (friend of @5511982667030) speak of the middle men, there seem to be two types 

Those that take inventory on credit thereby transferring the risk to the farmer (those that Marcus deal with) and those that undertake the risk of the shipment themselves (Jorge and Ashmati), my sense is there are no evil parties, it‚Äôs fundamentally about managing and minimizing inventory risk

Since it‚Äôs the consumer that realize the final value of the inventory, shouldn‚Äôt they be the ones that bear the inventory risk? 

If there was a way to pass all the inventory risk over to the consumer, my belief is that them at least having some common sense would probably avoid acquiring inventory from halfway around the world since those are the most risky

[4/21/23, 3:42:44 PM] Tess walkowski: Haha
[4/21/23, 3:46:43 PM] Gary Teh: Actually from my perspective doesn‚Äôt really matter that there are big players dominating the bulk and the bandwidth. Or even feel indignant that they are doing so. 

So long as there is market demand for some variant other than those provided by the big players and we could fulfill it, that is a good enough entry point to start deploying the land and expand strategy common amongst startups seeking to displace encumbants üôÇüëç
[4/21/23, 3:48:10 PM] Gary Teh: If there is not market niche that could be capitalized then it‚Äôs just a waste of time throwing eggs against the wall.

Be one with DAO. Be water my friend
[4/21/23, 3:51:11 PM] Gary Teh: Have started conversations with this locally ran cacao cooperative in northern Brazil that supplies to Meiji Japan. 

Checking the paperwork they have available now and what other paperwork we need in place before the shipment could leave Brazilian port
[4/21/23, 4:09:19 PM] Tess walkowski: I like this attitude
[4/21/23, 4:09:35 PM] Tess walkowski: Also in a way if you can't beat them join them

[4/21/23, 4:11:42 PM] Tess walkowski: Be water love this
[4/21/23, 4:12:11 PM] Tess walkowski: Reason says Brazil will be easier.  I think export is more established there.
[4/21/23, 4:19:02 PM] Gary Teh: Hiro introduced me to two cacao producers 

The second producer says he is traveling and will revert once he returns

Will start looking at setting up the Brazilian exporting company once I get back to Brazil from my conference in Europe. 

Will be arriving back in S√£o Paulo on 15th of May 

Have 30 days to kick start the paperwork from my time of arrival till getting booted out of the country

[4/21/23, 4:22:23 PM] Tess walkowski: If we succeed once we can do more.
[4/21/23, 4:22:40 PM] Tess walkowski: Also where are we gonna send the cacoa
[4/21/23, 4:24:13 PM] Gary Teh: That is why we need the NDA signed before we proceed to the next step

Next step is compiling the prospective buyers list and start doing the outreach
[4/21/23, 4:24:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Yeah that's nda
[4/21/23, 4:25:13 PM] Tess walkowski: It overlaps with my own business and interest so as we share those contacts
[4/21/23, 4:25:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I guess we research both. Producers and consumers
[4/21/23, 4:25:41 PM] Gary Teh: Otherwise anyone with access to the supplies could just take the compiled list and run with it, this impacting the efforts of DAo members, without consequences
[4/21/23, 4:27:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Also I am one of them
[4/21/23, 4:27:35 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean I brand under atelier lumina

[4/21/23, 4:35:36 PM] Tess walkowski: Where are you currently
[4/21/23, 4:37:46 PM] Gary Teh: Once the trade link between Brazil and Northern America is setup, my goal is to setup another trade link between Brazil and China 

It‚Äôs almost a no brainer after having spoken to quite a few locals on the boat here in the Amazon 

I have been studying China‚Äôs belt road initiative ever since leaving my position in the previous company 

Since 2005, China has surpassed US as Brazil‚Äôs largest trading partner 

I am a native Chinese speaker so it makes sense for me to just head into China to find buyers for soy and setup another trade route between Brazil and China
[4/21/23, 4:37:58 PM] Gary Teh: Prompted ChatGpt with this question. 

Which Latin American country will benefit the most from china‚Äôs belt road initiative?
[4/21/23, 4:38:11 PM] Tess walkowski: Do china first
[4/21/23, 4:38:16 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Several Latin American countries are expected to benefit from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a global infrastructure development strategy. However, the countries that stand to benefit the most are likely to be those that have the strongest trade and investment ties with China, as well as those that have demonstrated commitment to infrastructure development and attract investment. 

One country that has been identified as a potential beneficiary is Brazil, which is one of the largest commodity exporters in the world and has significant infrastructure needs. In recent years, China has become Brazil's top trading partner and a major investor in the country's infrastructure projects, including major oil and gas ventures. 

Other countries in the region, such as Peru and Chile, are also likely to benefit from the BRI due to their strategic location and strong trade ties with China. However, it is still too early to determine the exact extent of the benefits that Latin America will receive from the BRI, as the initiative is still in its early stages of development.
[4/21/23, 4:38:36 PM] Tess walkowski: China is easier my friend
[4/21/23, 4:38:40 PM] Gary Teh: That is a different set of commodities
[4/21/23, 4:39:03 PM] Tess walkowski: True. Probably.
[4/21/23, 4:39:33 PM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs just focus on one. 

Shifting target just causes everybody to lose focus and cause this project to degenerate into a useless chatroom
[4/21/23, 4:40:23 PM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[4/21/23, 4:40:40 PM] Gary Teh: We will finish setting up one trade route and then we move on to setup the next one
[4/21/23, 4:40:31 PM] Tess walkowski: It is easier by far to trade with china
[4/21/23, 4:40:44 PM] Tess walkowski: That would be the only pro
[4/21/23, 4:41:11 PM] Gary Teh: Then rinse and repeat the strategy till we have a whole bunch of them coming out of Brazil
[4/21/23, 4:41:07 PM] Tess walkowski: So we focus on Brazil usa
[4/21/23, 4:41:14 PM] Tess walkowski: Then Colombia usa
[4/21/23, 4:41:44 PM] Tess walkowski: And Colombia
[4/21/23, 4:41:47 PM] Tess walkowski: Peru
[4/21/23, 4:41:50 PM] Tess walkowski: Mexico
[4/21/23, 4:44:17 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah. 

Can you go figure out the full set of permits you need before your shipment of cacao is allowed to leave columbian ports?

List them all on a google word document and then share it once everybody signs NDA 

Texting and dumping all the details in this chatroom is not really useful in helping everybody keep update, and just this chatroom look really cluttered. 

I am starting to do the same on the Brazilian side

[4/21/23, 8:48:12 PM] Gary Teh: @554792591729 you mentioned your mum went for a cacao ceremony recently in Florianopolis 

Do you know where the shamans sourced their supplies from?
[4/21/23, 8:52:25 PM] Tess walkowski: It's a word people use to describe cacao
[4/21/23, 8:52:47 PM] Tess walkowski: Usually ethically sourced high quality
[4/21/23, 8:53:09 PM] Tess walkowski: It is cacao. Ie cacao solid.
[4/21/23, 8:53:37 PM] Tess walkowski: Nibs are this broken up
[4/21/23, 8:55:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Chocolate liquor is when cacao solid are separated from cacao butter , this is then used to make what we know as chocolate
[4/21/23, 8:55:41 PM] Tess walkowski: Usually ceremonially would be criolla or another original strane ie the least bitter strains
[4/21/23, 9:10:15 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 do you know a community of shamans in the US that use cacao?
[4/22/23, 2:39:04 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, we are still waiting for your filled out business model canvas.
[4/21/23, 9:23:12 PM] Tess walkowski: I do. Have participated and hosted.
[4/21/23, 9:23:40 PM] Tess walkowski: Most major cities have them.
[4/21/23, 9:24:41 PM] Tess walkowski: I wouldn't call them shamans. I know people who also consume daily.
[4/22/23, 12:06:04 AM] Barbara Sandini: I don‚Äôt know but I can totally ask . There are so many tribes that use

[4/22/23, 6:47:09 AM] Gary Teh: Could you provide an estimate by next week?
[4/22/23, 7:27:57 AM] Tess walkowski: Where these trees grow criolla is along amazon Ecuador / Colombia / Brazil / venezuala / Peru
[4/22/23, 7:28:09 AM] Tess walkowski: Mexico has its own special beans.
[4/22/23, 7:29:06 AM] Tess walkowski: It depends on the strength of my brand, story and values.

I practice philanthropy in my private life. But, this channel is about business.

[4/22/23, 3:24:18 PM] Tess walkowski: This is a fact not speculation.  And facts are what support the differention of criolla from other beans.    Or the difference between commercially grown monoculture and smaller sustinance farming

And I see much value in learning how trade routes operate.   I am here bc I have an interest in how we could leverage daos in trade. Absolutely small farmers having equity is important to me.  But if this is not productive then I also won't continue.
[4/22/23, 5:16:26 PM] Fatima: When the Business Model Canvas of your project is ready, I believe people here can share insights and contribute.

Not being able to follow, they won‚Äôt be able to contribute because they have no idea the state of the project

[4/26/23, 9:34:42 AM] Gary Teh: Getting more details from the two cacao producers that Hiro introduced now. They work with their local cooperatives. 

They are right now reaching out to their local cooperatives to get more information on export permits they already have 

Meanwhile I will be circling back to @6598622082 and the contacts on his end which have more information on international buyers

Once we get more visibility on both sides we might then be able to fill out more details in the business model canvas for this project
[4/26/23, 9:41:14 AM] Gary Teh: While we might have aspirations to serve small scale marginalized communities, based on what I am seeing right now it makes more sense to figure out where the actual market gap is and then fill it. I am sure where along the way market opportunities will arise that will lead us closer to further in the direction of our idealism

From my perspective it is always important to have a healthy balance of idealism and pragmatism when operating projects. 

The main difference between Jesus and common mortals is that when the former chooses to survive purely on idealism, he got resurrected three days after his passing. Whereas the common mortal just stays dead.
[4/26/23, 9:56:51 AM] Tess walkowski: I think based on what we have to tackle with regulations, yes we need someone more developed who has the ability to export
[4/26/23, 9:57:24 AM] Tess walkowski: I agree on that too, being led by product market fit
[4/27/23, 3:33:00 PM] Gary Teh: We have got a shaman grade cacao supplier from Ecuador that could provide cacao supplies

There are two options available we can choose to interface with. 

Option 1: White label 

We will need to get our own USFDA approval and import custom clearance done



Option 2: become a distributor 

Supplies will be fully customs cleared for the US with USFDA certification done. We will need to cobrand with the supplier for the goods we plan to distribute in the US

Which one shall we go for?
[4/27/23, 3:33:36 PM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéPOLL:
Which option shall we opt for
‚ÄéOPTION: Whitelabel our own (3 votes)
‚ÄéOPTION: Be a distributor and cobrand (3 votes)
[4/27/23, 3:54:40 PM] Tess walkowski: White label.  The DAO verified the cacao provider. Future cacao is possible.  DAO becomes a brand.
[4/27/23, 3:55:02 PM] Tess walkowski: Distributor. Way easier first step. Simpler. Cheaper
[4/27/23, 3:55:48 PM] Tess walkowski: DAO defines "shaman grade"
[4/27/23, 3:55:57 PM] Tess walkowski: "ceremonial grade"
[4/27/23, 5:17:14 PM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps we do distribution approach while we figure out the end to end nuts and bolts of setting up the cacao distribution business in the US

Once we get more familiar we can start transition to white labeling perhaps with other suppliers?
[4/27/23, 5:18:08 PM] Gary Teh: Right now, I am still not at all comfortable with the distribution business since we don‚Äôt even have any visibility yet on where we are going to find the buyers

[4/28/23, 5:23:54 AM] Gary Teh: I took a step back and re-examined the situation

If the mission of EcoVerse21 is to help small scale marginalized farmers gain access to international buyers through pre-purchases, wouldn‚Äôt the proliferation of the knowledge on how to do so encourage more people to help actualize that?

But wouldn‚Äôt the free proliferation of these knowledge compromise on the profitability thus viability of the project itself. 

And if such is the case, why should members continue contributing to the project if the knowledge is that at some point the project might self sabotage by proliferating this knowledge for the greater good of its mission? 

Seems like a catch 22.

Will extend our white paper later with the two tier model I have in mind that will allow external investors to stake their funds for investment returns to finance the cost of inventory, shipment and storage prior to sales and delivery. üôÇüëç

Since the external investors will be bearing the bulk of the financial risk, the DAO return‚Äôs will primarily be just an infrastructure provider charging a transaction fee.
[4/28/23, 6:59:41 AM] Tess walkowski: My small personal capital is going into cacao, and absolutely my goal is to sell it.    But it gets me product in my hands that I can use to explain what ceremonial cacao is.
[4/28/23, 7:00:49 AM] Tess walkowski: The smart contract could do this.
[4/28/23, 7:53:25 AM] Gary Teh: One of the key things that really stood out based on what @13134136108 @41765737357 @254700187599 as well as from what I understood from the other ceremonial grade cacao supplier is that these supplies cannot be treated as normal commodities. 

the story component is as important if not way more so than the product itself. 

Story will compromise of the culture and history of the community that produced it, the sustainable farming methods they use and how the profits generated via the sales of their product are channeled back to developing their community‚Äôs infrastructure 

In that regard traditional distribution models will not work. Here is why. when dealing with a conventional commodity trader, from his perspective one cacao nut is no different from the other cacao nut. But from an enlightened truth seeking consumer‚Äôs perspective, the difference between one and another is world‚Äôs apart especially if the other is produced by Monsanto Inc where GMO techniques has been heavily applied. 

The way I see it we will end up setting up and operating a direct to consumer distribution model. 

The whole tokenomics is now crystal clear in my head.
[4/28/23, 7:55:37 AM] Tess walkowski: Thats hitting the nail on the head

[4/28/23, 10:45:37 AM] Gary Teh: Bump
[4/28/23, 10:52:45 AM] Fatima: Could you, please, answer the following questions:

1. How big do you estimate this market to be? 
2. How much demand for this type of cocoa? 
3. Who are the potential clients? Only for rituals?
How much are they willing to pay?

[4/28/23, 10:57:21 AM] Gary Teh: While we wait for this poll to close out, please take sometime to sign and post a copy of this non-compete agreement specific to EcoVerse21 in this chatroom if you would like to continue participating in this guild.

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/noncompete

I have consulted with @381644913030, since TrueSight DAO and Ecoverse21 does not yet have a legal off chain representation, any an agreements signed with them as counter party will not be legally binding. 

Thus the workaround is in the event of a breach of trust, TrueSight Inc (a technology solutions provider for TrueSight DAO) will pursue its rectification on behalf of Ecoverse21 under the US, Delaware Jurisdiction.
[4/28/23, 12:10:34 PM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‚ÄéYou changed the group name to ‚Äú[guild][project] Ecoverse21‚Äù
[4/28/23, 12:11:04 PM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‚ÄéYou changed the group name to ‚Äú[project] Ecoverse21 Guild‚Äù
[4/29/23, 6:46:02 AM] Tess walkowski: How do I sign an NDA when I am in the cacao business myself?  I am micro scale but still?
[4/29/23, 6:52:28 AM] Gary Teh: The key part is you do not utilize any of the information or contact information released within this chatroom for your business. 

And you agree that whatever information you choose to release within this chatroom that gets utilized by EcoVerse21 will grant you governance tokens in our DAO. 

After understanding your profile this is how I think you can contribute to EcoVerse21 

I observed your strengths directly relevant to the scope of this project are in sourcing, writing and also due to your proximity to the cacao farmers ability to make videos and photos
[4/29/23, 6:59:03 AM] Gary Teh: This non-compete agreement is pertaining to proprietary data contributed by all members towards the blueprint for building out of all the logistics and legal plumbing we will be putting in place. 

Once we have done a few iterations we will be creating a platform on top of this plumbing where we allow small scale farmers and their representative to list their inventory for sale and pre-purchase by us for resale to the international buyers we will bring in via our distribution pipeline. 

From my perspective, you fall nicely into the role of the farmer representative too. However that is a latter stage
[4/29/23, 6:59:28 AM] Tess walkowski: What I would see as an ideal outcome, it DAO cacao to succeed and to have it be a vetted source
[4/29/23, 7:00:35 AM] Tess walkowski: I could have led the tour yesterday.
[4/29/23, 7:01:55 AM] Tess walkowski: I could get a free room and become a guide but...energy better elsewheren
[4/29/23, 7:03:15 AM] Gary Teh: Would love to here more of that but Let‚Äôs shift this discussion to the beer hall 

As @5511982667030 has suggested We should focus discussion in this room to just business operations üôÇüëç
[4/29/23, 7:05:06 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, folks I have managed to figure out our warehousing facilities in the US 

Once done with tokenomics will shift focus to competitive analysis, thereafter profit and loss analysis üôÇüëç
[4/29/23, 7:16:14 AM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[4/29/23, 7:21:18 AM] Gary Teh: I have also been thinking through the advice from @381644913030, @5511982667030 about being selective in the proprietary information that gets exposed in this specific instance as well as similar advice given by @6598383264 and @41799155602 on matter of similar nature back last year. 

The white paper is a public facing document, it's intention is to attract audience interested in contributing to building out our engine or financing the transactions passing through once the engine is built. 

Rather than exposing the entire operating blueprint to the public to freely replicate, it will only contain high level information about our project. Key information about the inner mechanics of the engine will be omitted.

There will be a separate document called the Ecoverse21 operating manual where the entire end to end system is defined along with all the nitty gritty details for building the marketing, logistics, legal and financing functions for each new territory we plan to source from and plan to distribute into. 

This document will only be exposed to members who have already signed and submitted to a copy of the non-compete agreement in this chatroom.
[5/2/23, 12:46:18 PM] Gary Teh: Finished conducting market research to figure out the various market positioning and their profit potential for cacao in the US.

Exact details will be updated in the operations manual and will only be released to participants that have signed the non-compete agreement 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/noncompete

Up next:
    - figure out the costing for regulation 
    - figure out packaging cost 
    - figure out variable costing of warehousing facilities 
   - figure out variable costing of freighting into US

With that we should have an excel sheet where we simply insert the price small scale agricultural producers and their representatives are proposing to us for pre-purchase and a simple Yes or No with our response based on the economics of the situation
[5/2/23, 12:47:32 PM] Gary Teh: For a high level of the various roles you can contribute within the scope of this project please refer to

Let‚Äôs see if we can out together some marketing materials to test the market receptiveness for our cacao NFT collection these few days during the conference
[5/3/23, 2:36:45 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes. I'll text you so I don't spam the group
[5/3/23, 2:38:14 PM] Gary Teh: Great! ü§©
[5/5/23, 1:24:03 AM] Gary Teh: Trialed tested the high level parameters of the NFTs we will be floating with the audience I spoke with yesterday, given the kind of ROIs and return period,  seems they will get over subscribed once they become available
[5/5/23, 7:35:52 AM] Tess walkowski: What is the nft?
[5/5/23, 9:11:52 AM] Gary Teh: It‚Äôs the NFT that will be issued to the financing contributors in exchange for financing the shipments of agricultural products from small scale farmers from South America to North America as documented in our white paper. 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper

Initially these will be cacaos. Later on they will represent shipments of other agricultural produce
[5/5/23, 11:25:34 AM] Gary Teh: I have been having discussions with CEO of EthicHub which provides agricultural financing to the small scale coffee farmers in Mexico. 

The distribution networks we will be setting up to distribute agricultural produce from small scale farmers to end consumers is a perfect complement with their project.
[5/5/23, 2:43:22 PM] Gary Teh: The real work as everyone I spoken with seem to have correctly identified is the offline heavy lifting needed to go into the legal, logistics, warehousing and marketing aspects of setting up the distribution network 

Once the distribution network is up and running, providing liquidity via the NFTs associated with the shipment of the agricultural produce from these small scale marginalized farmers passing through the distribution network is a no-brainer.
[5/6/23, 3:22:08 PM] Gary Teh: Quick updates
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Just got the pricing details from the Brazilian CooP based in Baha‚Äôi 

Still awaiting for the pricing details from the supplier based in Ecuador which will become available next Tuesday 

@13134136108 has reached out to the freighting company based on Colombia.

What is the project name we should go forward with?
‚ÄéOPTION: Atelier Luminas (0 votes)
‚ÄéOPTION: EcoVerse21 (0 votes)
[5/7/23, 11:43:12 PM] Anupa/diya: Is this like a sub brand of ecoverse or is it a stand alone brand
[5/7/23, 11:46:17 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense to ask this question. What are your thoughts? 

@13134136108 introduced the name Atelier Luminas in her graphics
[5/7/23, 11:49:28 PM] Anupa/diya: It is like Fanta ... is a sub brand the coca cola company.  .

The products would go out as atelier Luminas ... under ecoverse 21

Or it would go out as a complete separate entity
[5/7/23, 11:49:51 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective we should just stick to EcoVerse21 for all the products shipped via the direct to consumer distribution channels we setup
[5/7/23, 11:50:03 PM] Anupa/diya: It would be like nice to this of some cacao centric names for the product fit.
[5/7/23, 11:50:13 PM] Anupa/diya: Think
[5/7/23, 11:51:27 PM] Anupa/diya: Maybe we use the name of the plant criollo.. like cricollo   summer. I don't know ..  something catchy
[5/8/23, 12:03:28 AM] Murtaza: I agree with Anupa teh company name can be Ecoverse but the brand name can be made more appealing to the consumer market
[5/8/23, 12:29:06 AM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs suggest a few names related to cacao for the white labeling route.

Meanwhile will be speaking with the Ecuador based exporter tomorrow. If we take this route We will be co-branding with them. Then we will be using their brand name and using EcoVerse21 our project name
[5/8/23, 2:05:09 AM] Anupa/diya: The name will also depend on the market fit and user group.
[5/8/23, 2:09:41 AM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs be more verbose 

Suggest 3 names
[5/8/23, 2:39:49 AM] Gary Teh: This implies you have done some research on market fit ü§©
[5/8/23, 6:01:29 AM] Tess walkowski: Bc that's my own brand probably non
[5/8/23, 6:04:27 AM] Tess walkowski: Agree in a way but ecoverse doesn't make you hungry
[5/8/23, 6:08:22 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is one product
[5/8/23, 6:09:47 AM] Tess walkowski: Using the name criolla is important.
[5/8/23, 6:53:52 AM] Tess walkowski: But it will not be our only export in time
[5/8/23, 6:54:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Product market fit, I can't answer in entirity....
[5/8/23, 6:54:58 AM] Tess walkowski: Are you all sold on a minimum $40 unsweetened bar of cacao ....
[5/8/23, 6:55:28 AM] Tess walkowski: I am but I am into this stuff
[5/8/23, 6:56:21 AM] Tess walkowski: There are some options too....for example chocolate makers luxury ones may prefer beans
[5/8/23, 6:56:43 AM] Tess walkowski: Criolla is used it's just rarely sold on the commodities market
[5/8/23, 6:57:06 AM] Tess walkowski: Ecudar is prob not criolla it's a tree called national
[5/8/23, 6:57:23 AM] Tess walkowski: It could be criolla.
[5/9/23, 8:57:05 AM] Gary Teh: Finished chatting with Ecuador exporter 

Key insights 
    - cacao paste has unlimited shelf life. Taste gets better with time 

    - our DAO has more than enough funds to pull off our very first end to end transaction

We are right now working on the Profit and Loss analysis after putting in all the costing from the various suppliers.
[5/9/23, 1:35:53 PM] Gary Teh: The cost items for the various components will be in soon. 

They will be break downs between lump sum fixed costs items that will need to be amortized across all the units of sales and variable costs which scales as units of sales increases
[5/9/23, 1:56:56 PM] Tess walkowski: I can sell it along my Colombian
[5/9/23, 1:57:28 PM] Tess walkowski: I didn't know that about the shelf like. The fat must preserve it. Or all the tannins.  Wow.
[5/9/23, 1:58:08 PM] Tess walkowski: Then I can feature the dao as well as I sell and begin to educate and connect further

[5/10/23, 4:08:42 AM] Gary Teh: Got it. Mainly addresses their lack of funds to buy seeds.

[5/10/23, 6:25:25 AM] Gary Teh: It is similar to what @918017107841 surfaced but not the use case our guild has voted to go after. In this case it is to buy a shipment from cacao from South America right now and have it sold in Northern America.

It might make sense to reach out to them but much later on when we start looking at Coffee. However from what I am seeing, might not be directly relevant since we will be looking to procure coffee supplies but they are looking to provide loans to the coffee farmers.
[5/10/23, 6:30:16 AM] Francois renet: I‚Äôm sure @41765737357 knows this already, but a friend told me recently that one of the best companies to approach when looking for leftover cacao shells etc‚Ä¶ is Nestle in Switzerland

It is a different type of cacao compared to criolla
[5/10/23, 10:05:09 AM] Gary Teh: This is what ChatGpt mentioned 

Arriba Nacional and Criollo are two different types of cacao.

Arriba Nacional, as mentioned earlier, is a variety of cacao that is primarily grown in the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is known for its unique fruity and floral flavor profile and its aroma. Arriba Nacional is typically a fine-flavored cacao variety, which means it has a high percentage of cocoa butter and lower bitterness. 

Criollo, on the other hand, is another type of cacao that is known for being a rare and high-quality variety. Criollo is typically grown in Central America and the northern regions of South America, including Venezuela and Colombia. Unlike Arriba Nacional, Criollo has a more delicate flavor profile that is characterized by its nutty and floral notes and its low acidity.

One of the main differences between Arriba Nacional and Criollo is their genetic makeup. While Criollo is known for being genetically diverse, Arriba Nacional has a relatively consistent genetic profile. Criollo is also considered to be a more fragile variety that is more susceptible to disease and environmental stress than Arriba Nacional.

Overall, both Arriba Nacional and Criollo are prized for their unique flavor profiles and their status as rare and high-quality cacao varieties. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct differences that make them recognizable to chocolate makers and connoisseurs around the world.
[5/10/23, 10:06:38 AM] Anupa/diya: @13134136108 could you share a copy of a sample grading spec sheet for Cacao
[5/10/23, 10:23:23 AM] Tess walkowski: Variaties are distinguished via genetics
[5/10/23, 10:24:06 AM] Tess walkowski: Based on recent discoveries this "national" may be related to the original cacao of Ecuador
[5/10/23, 10:24:35 AM] Tess walkowski: Here is wild ....there it was cultivated....5000 years ago

[5/10/23, 10:26:29 AM] Tess walkowski: I would say based on initial research that national is none of the above
[5/10/23, 10:28:04 AM] Anupa/diya: I am sure buyers want to see grading sheets . Do you know where I can find one
[5/10/23, 10:29:19 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't know what you are referring to
[5/10/23, 10:53:07 AM] Gary Teh: ChatGpt response 

Cocoa grading systems depend on the country of origin. Here are some examples:

1. International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) grading system: This is a standard grading system used by most producers. It categorizes cacao beans as Grade I, Grade II, or Grade III based on quality.

2. Brazilian grading system: In Brazil, cocoa is graded by its fermentation and drying stages. The stages are referred to as ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù, ‚Äúgood‚Äù, ‚Äúmixed‚Äù, ‚Äúfair‚Äù, and ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. 

3. Venezuelan grading system: In Venezuela, cocoa beans are graded based on their color, appearance, and aroma. The grading system works in a hierarchy system, starting from ‚ÄúSuperior‚Äù and going down to ‚ÄúLow Quality.‚Äù

In general, cocoa grades are determined by factors such as size, appearance, color, and flavor. Higher grade cacao tends to have a better flavor, aroma, and overall quality. The grading system can be useful for determining the value of the cacao beans as well as matching them to specific uses.
[5/10/23, 10:53:20 AM] Gary Teh: In short suppliers will provide grading information
[5/10/23, 10:54:30 AM] Gary Teh: In Brazil, cacao is graded by its fermentation and drying stages. The Brazilian cacao grading system classifies cocoa beans into five grades based on their visual appearance and aroma:

1. Superior: Superior beans are fully fermented and dried, with a shiny and smooth surface. They have a uniform size and color and a fruity and floral aroma.

2. Good: Good beans are also fully fermented and dried, but may have a slightly rough surface and less uniform size. They have a mild aroma and flavor.

3. Mixed: Mixed beans are partially fermented and dried, with a reddish-brown color and a rough surface. They have a sour or musty aroma and flavor.

4. Fair: Fair beans are under-fermented and poorly dried, with a grayish-white color and a moldy or off-flavor aroma.

5. Low Quality: Low-quality beans are poorly fermented and dried, with a discolored and broken surface. They have a strong and unpleasant odor and flavor.

Overall, the Brazilian grading system emphasizes the importance of proper fermentation and drying in producing high-quality cocoa beans. Superior and good beans are considered suitable for producing high-quality chocolate, while mixed, fair, and low-quality beans are typically used for other products, such as industrial chocolate and cocoa powder.
[5/10/23, 10:55:45 AM] Gary Teh: Ecuador, known for the famous Arriba Nacional cacao beans, has its own grading system for cocoa beans. The system is based on the size, color, and quality of the beans. Here are the grades and their characteristics:

1. Fino de Aroma: This is the highest grade of Ecuadorian cacao, which is defined by the International Cocoa Organization as having a distinct and fine aroma. Fino de Aroma beans are large, plump, and uniform in size, with a shiny and unblemished surface. They have a delicate flavor with floral and fruity notes.

2. Aroma: Aroma beans are the second-highest grade and have a similar aroma to Fino de Aroma beans, but are slightly smaller and less uniform in size.

3. CCN-51: CCN-51 is a hybrid bean developed in Ecuador and is known for its high yield. It is a lower grade bean compared to Fino de Aroma and Aroma, and is used for mass-produced chocolate and cocoa products.

4. Nacional: Nacional beans are native to Ecuador and are known for their distinctive floral aroma and nutty flavor. They have a slightly lower quality compared to Fino de Aroma and Aroma beans, and are often used for bulk production.

5. Other: This grade includes any beans that do not meet the standards of the above grades, such as those with defects, uneven size, or an inferior aroma and flavor.

Overall, the Ecuadorian grading system places a high value on the aroma of the cocoa beans, with Fino de Aroma beans being considered the highest quality due to their distinct and fine aroma and delicate flavor.

[5/12/23, 8:09:07 PM] Anupa/diya: Will send out an email. Then once they email. ..we can set up a zoom call. However  before we do that.  We should have the website and some information up
[5/12/23, 10:07:17 PM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[5/12/23, 10:12:20 PM] Gary Teh: Do indicate on the list the ones you have already reached out to. That way when I work on that same list we won‚Äôt overlap and waste effort 

The website is for new financing contributors who want to join as well as new members who are part of networks we can source more produce from. 

That from my perspective is not as high priority as finding the right vendors to work with to get our core supply chain up and running. 

We focus on the core and once the core foundations is established, we work outwards and building out the peripheries.
[5/12/23, 11:11:41 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that Tiff is connected with a network of indigenous tribes who produce stuff. 

Once we have successfully completed two iterations on our supply chain run, it makes sense to start looking at more sources to pipe through our supply chain 

Iteration 1: cobranding with supplier from Ecuador

Iteration 2: white labeling with Brazilian supplier
[5/13/23, 6:20:46 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys. Just stumbled on this website by chance. Thought I should share.

I speculate there might be some synergy if we can prove iteration 1 and 2 of our shipments is actually viable
[5/13/23, 9:56:12 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya this is good. If we do a b 2 b or even story telling narratives this is good. Like Karin said and others. Main thing buyers are looking for is a sutible product and a good story to tell.

[5/13/23, 3:32:11 PM] Tess walkowski: I want to start the process to write before I get input. I will use these text threads and feed them in to and look for inspirations here and I have the white paper
[5/13/23, 8:00:21 PM] Anupa/diya: So should we start a separate website for ecoverse. If it's a page or two then it's OK.  If it's more than that
[5/13/23, 8:00:40 PM] Anupa/diya: Then maybe a secondary one
[5/14/23, 12:27:31 AM] Gary Teh: EcoVerse21 should be it‚Äôs own website 

Start with two pages

Page one about the overall project 

A second page about the shipment for iteration #1

Once we are ready for our second shipment iteration 2. We create another page for that
[5/14/23, 12:28:18 AM] Gary Teh: The way i see it each new shipment will be its own page 

The page dedicated for the shipment should reflect its status
[5/14/23, 12:29:16 AM] Gary Teh: The contents that @13134136108 comes up with for cacao can be used in the page for iteration #1 which is about cacao shipment

Why cacao of all things
[5/14/23, 5:47:44 AM] Gary Teh: Had lunch with Leyla just now seems the supply of ceremonial cacao here is super expensive
[5/14/23, 6:24:56 AM] Anupa/diya: We need to see where we can find a market for it. Like the tea ceremony which is popularized by Michelin star restuarant with High end tea
[5/14/23, 6:25:51 AM] Anupa/diya: One is the tracking page. There has to be a b 2 b page as well

[5/14/23, 7:30:33 AM] Tess walkowski: This company hu, our competitor, just got bought out by mars oreo
[5/14/23, 7:31:13 AM] Tess walkowski: I am a little sick of them lol.

It‚Äôs exactly what the Ecuador exporter mentioned
[5/14/23, 7:33:42 AM] Gary Teh: You are the only US based shaman in this guild, if you could perform cacao ceremonies to draw in the US based folks for sales then that specific marketing channel might work
[5/14/23, 7:34:52 AM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[5/14/23, 7:35:18 AM] Gary Teh: If not then we should not be wasting our time in this guild discussing about that marketing channel until another US based shaman comes along who can execute it
[5/14/23, 7:35:47 AM] Gary Teh: We need to focus our discussion on what is actionable within this chatroom
[5/14/23, 7:39:40 AM] Tess walkowski: I would probably do a Buddhist style ceremony :)
[5/14/23, 7:40:58 AM] Tess walkowski: I was looking at pics of crypto fest tullum....and I was like um where are the Mexicans ?

Put it in a google doc

Let‚Äôs bring this thread of discussion offline
[5/14/23, 7:49:33 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes.  We are looking at like 4 articles at this point.   I can add what is a cacao ceremony
[5/14/23, 7:49:37 AM] Gary Teh: The main feedback I get is if the number of post in here gets too long, no one is going to bother reading them so there is almost Zero purpose in posting them here

[5/14/23, 1:10:51 PM] Gary Teh: The critical path for this project right now is to clear all the legal and logistical hurdles in place to get the 100kg of cacao shipped from Ecuador into our US based warehouse. 

That from my perspective is top priority

All other tasks from my perspective is secondary priority

@918017107841 as discussed with you earlier, I understand that will need to be some interfacing between the website content and the social media activities. Once she has presented the strategy, I will schedule a session where we could figure out the link up between these two components

However I would only activate marketing once we have brought our shipment in otherwise you spend all the efforts at marketing but there is nothing to sell

[8/22/23, 5:25:15 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 please note

Me and @16468233438 have concluded our meeting. 

*The resolution*
    - source for commercial kitchen here in the Bay area to package our initial 100KG of cacao nibs
    - source for vendor to print stickers which we will use to stick on the 500 kraft pouches we will buy on Amazon

*Updated agenda when myself and @5511982667030 convenes*
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will package our cacao nibs using kraft pouch
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will handle the packaging for the initial 100KG
    - to determine which of the following we will convey to Orlantildes post 100KG pilot test:
        - Option 1) we will not be packaging our cacao nibs in Bahia ever again
        - Option 2) we will consider packaging in Bahia after the initial pilot test if a kraft pouch supplier that is economic can be sourced
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes to drop all current arrangements we have already in place with Mailan and Package printing company
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes we will pass him a sample of the taste profile we are going for based on the outcome of our focus group. He will need to source for USDA NOP organic certified cacao nibs and ensure they match the taste profile we indicated
[5/15/23, 6:54:57 PM] Anupa/diya: Should we look into them .
[8/22/23, 6:48:51 PM] Val Lapidus: Speaking to my friend about our project.  Within our copy for the website we should have a comparison of how much a farmer usually makes when they sell cacao nibs to a distributor versus what a farmer will make when they sell to us.
[5/15/23, 6:55:38 PM] Gary Teh: Probably alittle too early. Have you tried contact them directly on their website?

[5/15/23, 6:56:27 PM] Anupa/diya: The info will only be available once you pay.
[8/22/23, 6:51:26 PM] Val Lapidus: We should also donate a portion of our proceeds to carbon offsets

I personally would just call the numbers listed on the website of the import brokers and start the conversation
[8/22/23, 7:19:05 PM] Gary Teh: Since the farmers plant trees

Why not directly issue carbon credits when every cacao tree sapling that gets planted??
[5/15/23, 6:57:17 PM] Anupa/diya: @972509342179 you can join in so we can just finalize the website
[8/22/23, 8:27:34 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 please invite my friend Liz, she is the one that had those ideas above and should get credit for them.  Also she said she would like to help with the project

[5/16/23, 3:33:01 AM] Gary Teh: I believe we will end up with execution problems if we go down this route for iteration one. 

reasons
   - who runs the experience? 
    - who drives the marketing execution?
    - it is going to end up being a much larger scope than a small quick experiment

I have got good vibes from May who is one of their staff. She was really helpful and proactive in making sure our shipment comes through. 

Plus they also have a lot of experience importing perishables into the Bay Area.

    2. - look into getting our DUNS number for becoming an importer
    3. - finalized the packaging portion of the marketing 4Ps for shipment 2. How many ounces for each bag of nibs. Based on the quantitative research data gathered

[8/26/23, 11:13:53 PM] Gary Teh: I have posed a request to @5511982667030 that for the upcoming meeting on Monday to inform Orlantildes of the following activities we are conducting on our end

*Items I am preparing*
- the list of critical points in the supply chain on Brazilian side identified during my previous visit 

- a preliminary list of hazards identified along each critical point of the cacao nibs preparation process based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested preventive controls based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested verifications measures to ensure integrity of preventive controls 

*What we need from him*
- a copy of the certificate of compliance that Coopercabruca has from the Brazilian government to allow for exports of cacao nibs overseas 

- preventive controls that Coopercabruca has in place to ensure they continue being in compliance with Brazilian government regulations to be eligible for exports of cacao nibs 

*expected outcomes of this exercise*

- combined and properly curated list of hazards identified to comply with existing Brazilian government regulations before exports are allowed and FDA FSVP compliance requirements 

- list of preventive measures that Coopercabruca has in place to prevent identified hazards 

- agreed upon verifications steps that Coopercabruca will undertake to ensure continued compliance so as to prevent identified potential hazards from occurring 

 *final outputs from this process* 

- a written assurance letter addressed to our company by the person in charge of quality control in Coopercabruca that agreed upon preventive controls are in place to prevent the list of potential hazards we have identified during this exercise 

- a mutually agreed upon recurring procedure we both agree to follow to verify that preventive controls are being diligently followed by Coopercabruca during the preparation and export of the cacao nibs
[5/16/23, 1:24:59 PM] Gary Teh: Can we get a designer to come up with the logo? The designer we are speaking to is only focused on designed the cacao container package.

[8/26/23, 11:53:58 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 since you and me will be repackaging the cacao nibs in the kitchen facility we are renting, I will be drafting a set of the following documents 

*documents*
- hazard analysis
- preventive controls
- verification steps 

*outcome*
- When using the kitchen we will need to adhere to the preventative controls  that are documented 
- this is to cover our asses legally even though we are qualified for very small business exemptions 

*later on after successful mvp*
- get certified as a Preventive control qualified individual (15 hour structured curriculum) so that when our US based food facility gets audited by the FDA we got our asses covered because we have the necessary certification to claim preventive control qualified individual status 

- register the food facility we are planning to use on an ongoing basis

*regarding shared kitchen arrangement*

- The operator of the shared kitchen does not need to register the food facility with the FDA since that operator does not directly handle the food 

But post the MVP we will need to register whatever food facility we plan to use on an ongoing basis with the FDA and be compliant 

Check out this document if you are keen

[8/28/23, 6:27:46 PM] Val Lapidus: The way our structure works up to now is members tokenize their contribution towards a budget by exchanging dollar to tokens.  So if I was to spend $500 on marketing.  I would spend it out of my budget.  Then tokenize that money?  And thus the dao didn't spend anything on marketing other than tokens which is the equivalent of ownership shares.  We don't need to put anything for marketing now. In the future we can split up the dao share.  If we need to
[5/16/23, 7:02:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Good for brainstorming.    Could choose then outsource drawing.
[8/28/23, 6:39:06 PM] Anupa/diya: They are things been done on the marketing side which are getting tokenized now like the website and few other things. 

I think We should have a section called Marketing and Product design as a separate value and not added to the DAO.
[5/16/23, 7:02:59 PM] Tess walkowski: Set up a brandguidline color set
[8/28/23, 6:43:15 PM] Val Lapidus: How do you quantify that as a percentage of the budget?  We don't have a true measurement of it and we don't have anything right now that points to how much that is actually costing us.  We leave it as part of the DAO right now.  Also, we want to make it look like we are not paying for marketing
[5/16/23, 7:04:20 PM] Gary Teh: We have a brand color set for our main DAO

@918017107841 do you think the color scheme would be relevant for this cacao brand or we should just start from scratch??
[8/28/23, 6:44:38 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm all for radical transparency.  But what's the point of sticking our finger in the air and guessing?  The current numbers are the numbers that we can represent and show people that that is in fact what is happening

[5/16/23, 7:15:32 PM] Tess walkowski: Name true sight ?
[8/28/23, 7:05:57 PM] Anupa/diya: I am aware of how it works. Web 3 marketing is a huge component and for investors  this will be area that they will look into
[5/16/23, 7:16:58 PM] Tess walkowski: Those colors make me think knowledge.  Blue has that tendency.
[8/28/23, 7:08:17 PM] Val Lapidus: So what is the concern that they don't see it broken down with a marketing budget. Shouldn't the DAO as a whole list it's marketing budget regardless of which product it's for? This breakdown is supposed to serve as proof that we are better than our competitors. With regards to how we split the profits with the farmer. The DAO itself on its website should list how much it spends on marketing.  But aggro verse doesn't do its own marketing
[5/16/23, 10:26:25 PM] Anupa/diya: Shouldn't we look into this and see what comes out of it. Hands of God is a bit vague. 

The colour scheme has to be according to the brand ethos and brand lines

[8/28/23, 7:28:08 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 Just throw some random numbers in for now. 

I am sure we will start figuring out what it might be once we start executing the go to market strategy that @381642051030 is crafting 

My sense is if we are heading down the micro-influencer social marketing route as suggested by @381642051030 some of them will be very happy to receive governance tokens (1 TDG to 1USD) for their efforts creating videos and posting them to their followers 

As for others who are not, we will depriotize them until last resort (when DAO has fiat in our treasury). At that point we will know for sure how much fiat actually goes to marketing expenses

Also do note that it‚Äôs quite hard to amortize marketing expenses across the entire batch of all future bags of cacao nibs sold this is because of customer retention is strong (for example 100%), marketing budget associated with each bag sold will just end up tending towards zero as the same marketing dollar gets spread ever larger number of bags 

*Best case scenario*
Imagine a micro-influencer doing a one time video for governance tokens and it goes viral and then all target customers we will ever reach buys and retains 100%  

Marketing budget in this scenario is 0.

*worst case scenario*
DAO exhausted USD1 million on marketing. Zero bags sold. Everyone in the DAO went bankrupt. 

Then all the whole pie will just end up being marketing budget ü§£

It's better we look into all these things now in some what way because product pricing is key.

[8/28/23, 8:51:57 PM] Anupa/diya: Can we have some subtitles if anyone can translate
[5/17/23, 2:52:23 AM] Anupa/diya: I don't know how it works for all this
[8/28/23, 8:52:22 PM] Anupa/diya: We can just use the YouTube widget
[5/17/23, 2:52:35 AM] Anupa/diya: Under ecoverse what all can we do.
[8/28/23, 8:52:31 PM] Gary Teh: You can auto translate the subtitles in YouTube

‚Äé[5/17/23, 2:55:49 AM] Anupa/diya: ‚Äéimage omitted
[8/29/23, 9:33:53 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 please reach out to @972543523823 

She is based in Amsterdam and is during the weekdays 

She will be happy to provide support during the weekends 

So have the request in as detail as possible sent over to her during the weekday 

Hopefully she could look into it on the weekend 

DM is generally more effective as she doesn‚Äôt really check the groups as much üôÇüôè
[5/17/23, 2:56:09 AM] Anupa/diya: It will be nice if we can get an illustrator for the branding
[8/29/23, 10:23:34 AM] Val Lapidus: I found a vendor that will do screen printing, 2 colors both sides in kraft compostable pouches.  the cost will be .15 per bag, 90$ for printing, and cost to ship to me
[5/17/23, 2:56:30 AM] Anupa/diya: We will need someone who does product photography
[8/29/23, 10:23:45 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm going to go with this vendor, rather than buy a printer
[5/17/23, 2:56:45 AM] Suheil z: i 2nd sticking to ecoverse mother branding , then each product can have its own sub branding
[8/29/23, 10:24:32 AM] Val Lapidus: I've asked our graphic designer via DM to give me a new image, with the required constraints
[5/17/23, 2:57:44 AM] Anupa/diya: In  most products use cases .. the sub brand is called cacao nibs
[8/29/23, 10:01:45 PM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to your support @972543523823 üôÇüôè

[8/31/23, 2:14:54 PM] Val Lapidus: just had a chat with George from the Edge & Node House, while normally their space is paid, they may host us within one of their existing Thursday Night Happy hours 5-7p.m. tentatively on September 14th.  Which would not only give us access to a space, but a captive audience that would sample the cacao nibs and give us feedback on the product.  He is going to get back to me later this week, if not early next

[5/17/23, 3:39:00 AM] Gary Teh: action plan for today:
    1. - follow up with a specialist consultant on FDA registration for our US legal entity
    2. - look into getting our DUNS number for becoming an importer
    3. - finalized the packaging portion of the marketing 4Ps for shipment 2. How many ounces for each bag of nibs. Based on the quantitative research data gathered
[9/3/23, 11:24:12 AM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with @5511982667030 about getting a farmers market stand in Sf so that we can conduct focus group every Sunday without even trying to recruit people since the foot traffic is naturally there
[5/17/23, 3:57:59 AM] Anupa/diya: Normally 100
[9/3/23, 11:29:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Farmers market generally charge you for a stall
[5/17/23, 3:58:00 AM] Anupa/diya: Gm
[9/3/23, 11:29:20 AM] Val Lapidus: The cost can be negligible but it adds up over time
[5/17/23, 3:59:08 AM] Gary Teh: 3 ounces / 100 grams per bag? 

Could you help verify against the listing for keto cacao on Amazon.com?
[9/3/23, 11:29:32 AM] Val Lapidus: When we do a farmer's market we need to have all the marketing materials such as sign in information on how customers can get it
[5/17/23, 3:59:50 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the exporter will also need to get registered with the US FDA.
[9/3/23, 11:52:38 AM] Gary Teh: Might be the same things we need when we start doing the pop ups In sprouts, Whole Foods and Safeway

On top of walking through the 4 legal docs we created using ChatGpt, We should hopefully get to discuss about the incorporation of the mother foundation with them too

*immediate*
    - Instagram official presence 

    - micro-influencers marketing (1000 to 10,000 followers)

*intermediate*
    - instagram shop: Wix allows integration into Instagram shop
    - Amazon shopfront 

*once we are sure of our supply chain*
    - Sprouts
    - Whole Foods 
    - Safeway

[9/4/23, 6:19:00 AM] Anupa/diya: Are we doing shipping within the usa
[5/17/23, 6:55:31 AM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs do EcoVerse cacao nibs then
[9/4/23, 6:19:05 AM] Anupa/diya: or other parts as well
[5/17/23, 6:57:00 AM] Tess walkowski: Ecoverse makes me think of captin planet
[9/4/23, 6:21:55 AM] Gary Teh: Right now just within the USA 

Judging based on the shipping cost estimates from USA to other parts of the world, e.g. to @41796560010 Aga and Francois

The shipping cost is prohibitive 

If Switzerland does indeed have a lot of incoming request then it makes sense to setup an alternate supply chain that does not pass through USA but ships directly from Brazil

If such is the case then we will setup a packaging operation within Brazil
[5/17/23, 6:57:48 AM] Tess walkowski: I see a superhero.

[9/5/23, 8:54:18 AM] Gary Teh: Drafted a script for the documentary which we will attempt to piece together
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk6Q4HNWIF4tJLCvjsyMZ8UCqmZtDQN4J2HNp6W4N6s/edit?usp=sharing

We will use snippets from this documentary for our instagram post.
[5/17/23, 8:39:53 AM] Tess walkowski: Done
[9/5/23, 9:02:41 AM] Gary Teh: Please suggest changes
[5/17/23, 10:55:24 AM] Gary Teh: The verdict seems clear. Let's get a poll from the larger DAO on which state to incorporate in. 

ChatGpt has suggested the following:

1. Delaware: Delaware is a popular choice for incorporating businesses due to its well-established corporate law structure, business-friendly regulations, and specialized courts, such as the Court of Chancery, which handles corporate disputes. Delaware offers favorable tax laws for businesses and has a strong legal framework that provides clarity and predictability.

2. Nevada: Nevada is known for its business-friendly environment, including minimal reporting requirements, no state corporate income tax, and no personal income tax. It also provides strong asset protection laws, making it an attractive option for businesses.

3. Wyoming: Wyoming is another state with business-friendly regulations and low taxes. It offers advantages such as no state corporate income tax, low annual fees, strong privacy protections, and a simplified reporting process.

4. New Mexico: New Mexico is gaining popularity as a favorable state for LLC incorporation due to its low filing fees, no franchise tax, and a straightforward business formation process. It also offers a business-friendly environment and favorable tax laws.

5. Texas: Texas is known for its pro-business environment and has no personal income tax or state corporate income tax. It offers a favorable regulatory climate, access to a large market, and a strong economy.

It's essential to consult with a legal and tax professional or an incorporation service to assess your specific business needs and determine the best state for incorporating your LLC as an importer.

[5/17/23, 12:34:30 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 

Let‚Äôs just have our guild members form the US based LLC then.
[9/5/23, 6:45:37 PM] Anupa/diya: We can also connect our Instagram to wix
[5/17/23, 12:37:24 PM] Suheil z: it will not differ much, the moment u start as independent LLC you will loose 40% of your reessources on taxation issues, let's build it right from scratch and set up thee elephant in the room--> foundation ... foundation in switzerland or vienna would make our life much easier for any projeect we want to develop further ....  i dont know if you arre famiiliiar with open AI foundation concept... have a look at it if not u will geet it fast and lets just follow, it got proven allready as best model

[5/17/23, 12:42:45 PM] Gary Teh: We will still need a US based LLC to import our cacao 

I think the whole Switzerland foundation can come later 

By the time we finish setting up and paying all the legal feels for the Switzerland foundation there will be no more money left in the vault for the LLC to borrow. 

The LLc might as well go somewhere else for financing in the first place ü§£

[5/17/23, 12:44:41 PM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs just go ahead and set it up independently of the DAO 

We will figure out how to account for the financing provided by the DAO on the books of the LLC
[9/7/23, 4:16:03 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! ü§©
[5/17/23, 12:44:44 PM] Suheil z: nop when llc is owned by mother foundation all revenue go to mother foundation and local llc will never make taxable profit ... and income tax will always get zero'ed with expenses
[9/7/23, 8:09:13 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 what do you think about showcasing allowing the Bean to Bliss episodes to cycle through on your MacBook during the 14th happy hour??
[5/17/23, 12:45:06 PM] Suheil z: llsn lsn i suggest for this piilot mvp ect just do it by yourself or pick up couple of other members that u personally trust

[5/17/23, 12:48:44 PM] Gary Teh: Are you also suggesting to not involve anyone from the guild too?
[9/7/23, 8:26:08 AM] Val Lapidus: yes
[5/17/23, 12:51:10 PM] Suheil z: not not involve in all this, i just mean that anyways all this what we are doing together, will function only based of trust... so invovle everyone here on whatsapp , on goveernance on decision making but on papers unfortunately not feasible yet..  per example i trust u personally , i talk to u here we take decisions here i care the less about "how to " perform it on papers to satisfy those m...f$%#erks politicians , just that with governments we need to be ultra smart (not right) then between us we figure it out all :)
[9/7/23, 8:26:52 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 had an idea for the happy hour, could buy a bunch of gift cards for coffee (philz or pete's) and give them out as a reward for sampling and giving feedback
[5/17/23, 12:53:16 PM] Gary Teh: Ok then, members will really need to trust that all their efforts contributed to EcoVerse21 in exchange for DAO governance tokens will be worth something 

And that trust will be based on the fact that I do not renegade after taking the funds from the DAO to finance the first shipment via the LLC I incorporated just in my name
[9/7/23, 8:35:26 AM] Gary Teh: That might work üôÇüëä
[5/17/23, 12:54:19 PM] Suheil z: look at the group everyone waas"sleeping" now that u brought up serious project suddenly i heard new voices(on me ) ... what i want to osay by that... now that we reach serious moments , we build serious governance voting ...

It ends up being a mini documentary series

Three competitors in the ceremonial space that have their produce available on Amazon 

See how what they are advertising about their product that is different from other competitors 

Check through the comments of people leaving the reviews to see what the buyers really care about

That will help us figure how to position differently and not just compete on price 

We will die that way

[5/18/23, 5:38:02 AM] Anupa/diya: The 3 board at times gets automatically closed if you try to create a 4th board so technically its only 2.
[9/15/23, 6:28:42 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 does not seem like @918017107841 has managed to update your contribution on the ledger yet

I will update the ledger and follow up with the items you discovered on Agroverse.shop
[5/18/23, 5:38:24 AM] Anupa/diya: There is no pressure. If we feel we need it, we can go for it
[9/15/23, 6:31:04 AM] Anupa/diya: I haven't managed as yet.
[5/18/23, 5:39:03 AM] Gary Teh: Just go for the free trial. If it does bring value we can consider later on for upgrade
[9/15/23, 6:32:32 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Will do.
[5/18/23, 5:39:42 AM] Gary Teh: I‚Äôm generally very skeptical about the promises of productivity gains by the software solutions until it‚Äôs proven. But open to try if it‚Äôs free üôÇ
[9/15/23, 7:41:08 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @14153000019

[5/18/23, 5:39:57 AM] Anupa/diya: Its similar as miro which we have already used.
[9/15/23, 7:58:40 AM] Val Lapidus: I've delivered the packaging designs to our vendor
[5/18/23, 5:40:08 AM] Gary Teh: So what do you need to start to actually take the next step?

[5/18/23, 6:01:02 AM] Suheil z: ahhhh ii see what is muralll yes yes got the chance in my long past to use it while working with some companies, it is a great tool for brainstoarming and design collaboration
[9/15/23, 10:33:54 AM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 You can allocate some tokens for her
[5/18/23, 6:01:39 AM] Suheil z: sure at the end everything is exportable and importable hhh

[5/18/23, 6:03:45 AM] Suheil z: if u need to prepare plans use mural or monday iit would be much easier for you and for us :D
[9/15/23, 10:59:10 AM] Anupa/diya: I saw some graphic posts.  Are they made in house or from the net. If it's in-house  they need to be resized and withe some branding
[5/18/23, 6:03:53 AM] Anupa/diya: There is no point doing the free version if we are not going forward.
[9/15/23, 7:15:33 PM] Gary Teh: ‚ÄéYou deleted this message.
[5/18/23, 6:04:11 AM] Gary Teh: Sure that works too.
[9/16/23, 5:20:39 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438, could we start getting the shed ready for storage of official DAO managed inventory?

The 6kg will be the first of many to come
[5/18/23, 6:04:22 AM] Gary Teh: How do you define going forward?
[9/16/23, 5:22:06 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 could we schedule the use of their kitchen to package the 6kg I am bringing in from Brazil once the following conditions are met

    - I brought the 6kg over
    - the packaging materials arrive
[5/18/23, 6:04:55 AM] Suheil z: ii can disagree a bit with you , we need to try and if it works fine then we continue

[5/18/23, 6:06:50 AM] Gary Teh: I totally agree.
[9/17/23, 11:00:47 AM] Anupa/diya: I think speaking to Emelin will be a good idea. If she has an ux background she can surely assist in research or even focus groups with the farmers
[5/18/23, 6:20:08 AM] Tess walkowski: I would kindly request anyone help name our competitors.    Let's take a look and audit.
[9/17/23, 12:08:03 PM] Gary Teh: I think before we more seriously explore ESG community donations component for Agroverse let‚Äôs just make sure we can actually sell the cacao nibs in USA first ü§£

100% donation of USD0 is still 0USDjust wasting everybody calories talking about NULL scenario ü§Ø
[5/18/23, 6:20:20 AM] Anupa/diya: I am sure. I have used it for my work plentiful so I know it's capacities and how it can be used. I unfortunately donot gave the time to spend on trials. If you want please go ahead and explore and then we can decide

Fatima was hounding about it yesterday
[9/17/23, 2:17:49 PM] Gary Teh: We now await FDA to issue the Food Facility Registration number and we can then proceed issuing purchase order for the 100KG
[5/18/23, 6:27:52 AM] Gary Teh: My goal is to understand where the gap is in the market segments we are going for

I will be looking at key benefits Sellers use to incentivize sales to customers 

Where they are positioned in the market segment and how large those positions are.

[9/20/23, 4:52:44 AM] Anupa/diya: the Brazilian government has launched a program called ‚ÄúInternet para Todos‚Äù (Internet for All) that aims to bring internet access to remote areas by building cell towers and laying fiber optic cables. Another barrier to internet access in rural Brazil is the cost of internet service.
[5/18/23, 2:33:16 PM] Tess walkowski: I can help look at this, however need to slow down also to feel.   Write out too five competitors out in a spreadsheet I'll write notes on values and explore websites
[9/20/23, 4:52:45 AM] Anupa/diya: Mexico‚Äôs Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) announced this week that it would budget over MX$622.8M toward its ‚ÄúInternet for all‚Äù campaign in order to improve connectivity in Mexico. This project makes up one pillar of the five infrastructure projects set out by the ministry for this yea

[9/20/23, 4:54:54 AM] Anupa/diya: Many farmers have no access or very little access to internet. We should in parallel if we agree as a group look at internet access. There is no point of building a system where the key stakeholders have no access for say because there is no way they can be included due to no connectivity
[5/18/23, 3:06:19 PM] Gary Teh: Please put them on a google sheet and list their differentiating attribute

If you need help with being short and concise, ChatGpt has been very helpful üôÇüôè

[5/19/23, 11:12:00 AM] Suheil z: i would wait a bit as i found a girl who is X nike designer NFT's and she told me to continue discussing that she join officially and take care of all design related matters , specially for future NFT project :)
[9/21/23, 4:18:07 PM] Val Lapidus: going to provide following feedback to designer: Option 3, but with following adjustments: 

There needs to be something that points out that we don't have marketing/retailer costs with Agroverse model, I know it's difficult to represent 0 in physical form, so if you want to assign a value of .5% to Retailer/Marketing respectively you can take one away from the DAO.

The order for the items needs to be same: 
major distro model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer, Marketing
agroverse model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer (0%), Marketing (0%), DAO.

The coloring for each needs to match so for Farmer in both models, should have same color, Trasport in both models should have same color, and etc....  We want people to be easily able to compare.  I'm actually not sure about this one, so you can give me two options one where colors from item to item align, and one where it doesn't.

Thank you.
[5/19/23, 11:15:19 AM] Suheil z: adding to my personal opinion, that we shouldnt divide the requirements of design. 1 designer should prepare all branding material , not efficient and very costly if we divide it by parts :ii mean iif 1 designer today makes only logo, then tomorrow we will need someone to make the bags or the packagiing or branding book , branding identity ect ect ect...

    - TikTok micro-influencers accounts: Attract buyers to our official website
    - Amazon.com: organic buyers based on keyword optimization to our store front on Amazon.com

Otherwise half the time is wasted figuring out what the agenda is
[9/27/23, 6:47:05 AM] Anupa/diya: I feel I should just be in a group for  service proposition - for TruSight and Agroverse together more for the strategy. I can be like an observer for the operations. Just to see if in anything needs to feed in. Tune in to groups like once a month - social media - to just align with them. Be a Guild hopper. üòÜ

[5/22/23, 3:46:46 AM] Gary Teh: As I dive more deeply into this space I am started to observe simultaneously positioning our brand for two market segments will be tricky 

At this point, I am almost feeling inclined to drop the ceremonial cacao market segment since the disruption channels are not as easily accessible and the sales volume of those we have direct access to are too small for me to personally feel confident we will be able to unload our entire inventory

    - profit margin per unit
    - inventory turn around time

The higher the profit margin, the faster the turn around time of our inventory the more efficient our capital deployed

As it was not made "mobile first", I will need to fix the mobile later as well.

@16468233438 is focused on the operations side of things
    - vendors 
    - packaging
    - logistics and shipping
    - storage

[9/30/23, 11:07:26 AM] Gary Teh: I think every account of a sort Instagram/ Facebook or any social media platform has its own unique form of expression.

At the end of the day is expression ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù

The key I‚Äôll recommend will be **‚Äúhow/which‚Äù aspects *** you‚Äôll like to ‚Äúshow‚Äù integrate the product in this case ‚ÄúAgroverse‚Äù to the public. 

Keep it simple and send the message out there for the public. If is to sell an image, if is to give to others the product benefits or to put out there a message to the world community !

**Ex: trees üå≥ cocoa ü´ò local‚Äôs displayed of product and regional growth details of its made of origin, ** 
as we all know todays world we mainly are thriving to be organic in all aspects in life in this case ‚Äú agroverse‚Äù agriculture üë©üèª‚Äçüåæ

Order all the available inventory and then ask for everything to be returned. So I get all my money back and then keep the inventory

May be we could get the sample and shoot it ourselves
[10/1/23, 1:28:52 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think we need to create a seperate whats app channel, that will not allow any conversation, but will act as a repository for all FDA compliance items required by the FDA.  Or we could do a google group / folder

[10/1/23, 1:49:05 PM] Val Lapidus: to comply with FSMA standards we will need the following items, As I come across more items I will edit and update this post:

HACCP plan
Lot records for each individual imported item, with details of origin
shipping/receiving/storage logs
Lot #ing system: XXX-TTTT
XXX: uniq 3 digit ID of source farm *we should publish our FARM ID's to our website
TTTT: 2 digit month/2 digit year of receipt to US based warehousing
We need to retain a small amount (4-8 oz) of product from every lot #, that we can then utilize for testing.
A process document detailing how the product is packaged at farm, how it is shipped, how it is received in the US, How it is stored in the US upon receipt, how it is then taken to a commercial kitchen to be repackaged, how it is then stored, and then how it is shipped.
[5/25/23, 2:03:14 AM] Anupa/diya: Brand conversation will lead to the  brand guidelines

concluded our call that , we prepare our ecoverse base story (which will be based on all marketing material all team prepared) --> for that i opened file called the story with ready layout / structure how to build the ecoverse story. 

when we have base story well formulated, we will then build up strategies of story telling adapting to each different platform ( per example the instagram one will be slightly different than the lined in one).

as per each channel will need to identify the difference between audience and set up the atmosphere accordinggly

[10/9/23, 8:35:28 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 I was thinking through our marketing

At the top of the marketing funnel, It‚Äôs basically about getting the most *amount of eyeballs* on our messaging using the *least amount of resources* 

The recipe that most naturally fits the bill is *controversy* 

What is the most extreme, most controversial, most polarizing and yet still factually correct and relevant piece of messaging we can use to get the Agroverse story out there?

We really don‚Äôt want to spend all our time and effort coming up with messaging that basically triggers off *zero emotional response* ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[10/10/23, 5:14:46 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think something we will need to do to get our product to be searchable on Amazon, is buy it ourselves a few hundred times.  Amazon algorithms prioritize best sellers in searches.  so if we can get each DAO member to make a purchase, then we will refund them their purchase (if they want to be refunded) *if not they should get DAO tokens* then this will certainly drive up our search in Amazon.

The more aligned vision people have about the Agroverse, the better for the brand. What I am about to comment is based on what I've read so far and understood by the documentation and the uses of certain terminologies. If you feel we should discuss it further, I will be happy to help.

[10/11/23, 9:01:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Agroverse is a transparent direct-to-consumer agricultural distribution network that connects small-scale farmers in developing societies with people around the world who are concerned about the environment, their health, and sustainability. We have emerged out of the necessity to rethink food consumption and the commitment to work together with economically disadvantaged production communities, transforming the agricultural economy into a collaborative endeavor.

[10/11/23, 9:02:50 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I changed the small-scale farmers - international market to people who are interested in the environment, their health and sustainability. We use words as: community, building something together, so connecting farmers to people worldwide speaks more of community than farmers- international market.

[6/7/23, 3:55:45 PM] Tess walkowski: The Cabruca method of farming is a sustainable farming method that is often used in Bahia for cacao cultivation. This method involves planting cacao trees in the shade of other trees, such as the native rainforest trees, rather than in direct sunlight. This helps to preserve the rainforest while also providing a sustainable way to cultivate cacao. The method is named after the traditional agroforestry system of the Tupi-Guarani indigenous people, who used it to cultivate cacao and other crops. The Cabruca method has been shown to be effective in preserving biodiversity and soil quality in Bahia's cacao plantations.

[10/21/23, 12:04:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Feedback from last night:
We need to align on which CTA(s) we are testing or trying to convey.  Subscription? Purchase? Recruitment?

The CTA should be aligned to who the audience is.  If it's tech people, we should be recruiting.  

If the CTA is buy or follow, the actual product should be sampled and used.  Our product is cacao, we need to give samples of the nibs.  Hot chocolate can be an enticer, but isn't what we are selling.

We should not be talking about how the coco nibs won awards.  When we are not selling those.

We need to ensure with the host that we will be given time to announce before or after.

We need to ensure our placement is to greet people as they walk in.  We were at the very end of the venue, which caused people to come in and block the path to get to us.  

We need to think about bringing a different product.  Cacao nibs are a niche product and may be a difficult sell.
‚Äé[6/8/23, 4:06:30 PM] Gary Teh: ‚Äéimage omitted
[10/21/23, 12:05:13 PM] Gary Teh: But should we be recruiting instead of selling to Tech People?

[10/21/23, 12:05:46 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes if it's tech our goal should be follow insta or recruit
[6/8/23, 7:06:31 PM] Anupa/diya: Beautiful! Love it !
[10/21/23, 12:06:37 PM] Gary Teh: I think we should just focus our CTA on selling. When I ran my own prior growth experiments having two conflict CTAs causes conversion rate to drop by 75%
[6/8/23, 7:07:02 PM] Anupa/diya: Love the colour !
[10/21/23, 12:06:52 PM] Val Lapidus: Selling what?

[10/21/23, 12:09:47 PM] Gary Teh: I think we need to figure out a short script that we just stick to that works. 

Otherwise if we want to scale this event if and when it works, getting professional folks who are skilled in delivering scripts versus getting random folks who don't need to deliver scripts is way way harder.

[6/9/23, 10:48:24 AM] Anupa/diya: An email
[10/21/23, 12:12:46 PM] Gary Teh: Get them on the instagram. The goal is to eventually convert them to buyers

[10/21/23, 12:12:57 PM] Val Lapidus: For tech events Our CTA should be followers on insta.  And our main point should be how we use the blockchain

Use blockchain for tracking
Legal aspects of import

Not ones that we created, but we need to contact existing and get them to allow to sponsor.  Going to tech events and trying to sell a product that they have not expressed interest in is a futile exercise reminiscent of Sisyphus

The Bay area does not have just techies.  And also the group of techies and keto followers is not mutually exclusive.  But keto does not necessarily have a high level of intersection with techie

I see it as an AB test
We will go with whichever CTA that better converts at this tech events.

Goal: *get more instagram followers*

More time is wasted on agonizing over which option is better than just simply testing two and then moving on quickly. I have seen this happen many times before in growth teams ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[6/11/23, 9:50:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Planning to do a long form on BAHIA with all the info I have

[6/11/23, 10:24:14 AM] Gary Teh: Let‚Äôs just hold off on naming the group until we signed the exclusive northern American distribution agreement since we will be investing heavily in fiat to help build up their infrastructure. We don‚Äôt want other folks to just free ride on it once we setup the infrastructure 

Just call them cooperatives of small scale marginalized farmers based in Brazil
[10/21/23, 1:07:47 PM] Val Lapidus: Maybe hacker dojo would be a better venue if they haven't heard it for 6 months. Maybe it's time to rehash
[6/11/23, 10:24:21 AM] Tess walkowski: The longer form helps alot, takes longer to right, but its powerful and becomes a base of knowledge to best on.     Package copy is playfully being written and rewritten with visible experiments.

[10/21/23, 1:14:15 PM] Val Lapidus: We have to do research on this and find the right talking points for it. I don't mind doing it but we need to further expand on this and be able to talk about why this is better

[10/22/23, 3:25:42 AM] Suheil - Europe: my input on piing pong of CTA at events.

Offline event is to build the community. if its a web3 tech event then i am gearing more towards val that it not about selling them the cacaao nibs . it is about pitching our real life use case of how we , as ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù community following DAO principles and bootstrapping a traditional business by contributions. how we are doing it today vs how we envision scalability using deep tech such as blockchain / AI ‚Ä¶.

it is not about ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù engineers to come code for truesight or agroverse. it‚Äôs about raising awareness how we leverage tech for x y z reasons‚Ä¶

[10/22/23, 9:18:23 AM] Val Lapidus: If I make this recipe and someone asks me:  how did you learn about this.  I can respond with "I googled it". Or a much better and captivating response would be, this recipe comes from one of the contributors to the agroverse community, Emelin, who lives in brazil.  It is a recipe that has been passed down for 12 generations ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[10/23/23, 8:40:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: With minimum help I can test it. F√°tima and @557391090002 feel free to join. Once I understand how it works, I have no problem recording a tutorial myself.

[6/20/23, 11:48:32 AM] Gary Teh: Key focus for today
‚Äî‚Äî
Got too distracted today by a whole bunch of random stuff that is not on this project‚Äôs critical path.

My energy for the day is all used up. 

Will take a break for the rest of the day to recuperate. 

My personal energy level has been at 20% ever since suffering from the two car crashes and nearly dying in the most recent one in 2021. Crossing 40 years of age also doesn‚Äôt help. 

That is my main concern for personally being dragged into too many different directions üôÇüôè

Will check in again tomorrow
[10/23/23, 8:46:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, as long as I can get minimum knowledge and finish what I have to.
[6/20/23, 11:50:34 AM] Gary Teh: Fatima always reminds me the need to behave like a 41 year old man with despite still feeling young at heart so that I don‚Äôt wear myself too thin

I think it is great advice

[10/23/23, 8:48:39 AM] Anupa/diya: You can start the layout for a template and add in the information. If and when.  Didn't I send it to you. Can you please send me your email address
[6/20/23, 3:17:12 PM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: If we suceed, we find the DAO.    If we fail, we learn what we do wrong and try again.
[10/23/23, 8:48:42 AM] Emelin - Bahia: This is how I like to work. 1. We gather knowledge, talk straight ahead. 2. We break in parts so it can be understood as a process or step by step. 3. We check if it looks simple. 4. If doesn't looks simple we make it simple.
[6/20/23, 3:17:52 PM] Gary Teh: We already have our DAO. That is TrueSight DAO. If we succeed, our DAO has a revenue stream created
[10/23/23, 8:49:11 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Maybe it is because I have it hard to understand when keywords are not used.
[6/20/23, 3:18:11 PM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: fund sorry
[10/23/23, 8:50:01 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I understand the word through keywords. Every word contains a lot of different meanings and until we get to sort in which contexts they are being used, communication is lost.
[6/20/23, 3:19:16 PM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: worst case we fail, reinvent and try again.    Bottstrapping via amazon removes some risk.  I looked at Ebay yesterday.
[10/23/23, 8:50:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Actually it gave me an idea ü§î

[6/20/23, 4:11:46 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true for crypto

Gas fees for transactions are actually charges that was why I was asking @31641075825 about which chain the governance token for the other project he was talking about will be on. 

If a chain provider can convince a project to go on to their chain they technically become the toll gate

I will just go ahead and compile a contact list of the small shop retailers we should be reaching out to here in the Bay Area
[6/20/23, 4:13:45 PM] Suheil - Europe: We will need to build it up on DAO'a private chain ...actually semi off on chain mix.

The registered association legally speaking will have it'd own private tokenized environment using the decentralized

I know the technology full stack from end to end as well as how each layer makes money that is why I am so anal who owns which layer of the stack

If done wrongly it‚Äôs like the bunch of us spent all out money to go around the world to build a successful business and once the business is built we hand off the passive income to 1Inch network on a silver platter while we own nothing of it

That to me is just stupid

It will never be economically viable if when each start up will pay different agencies or designers to just make designs and then choose whichever .... this sounds more like mentality of royal families how they waste their money on projects ü§£ü§£ü§£

This was a "late" sample.

We should make it better by being "fresh" : 
- before you attending events we announce  --> during event u live or story
[6/21/23, 7:48:42 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: We could have a second set but do it with the group we have
[10/26/23, 7:41:12 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It says it is from Hacker Dojo and internet tells me it is in the Silicon Valley. So I will add the adress.
[6/21/23, 7:48:56 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, best foot forward is good

After all we did have a discussion before about Annia creating a second set of packaging design so that we could choose and vote on it.

[6/21/23, 9:15:49 AM] Suheil - Europe: Lol I didn't understand this cost no I change my opinion as an experienced business entrepreneur with many proven track records this cost is not justifiable at this level at all!
[10/26/23, 8:33:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I added the Halloween event on the page, added the Instagram adress in two sections (still think we need to rethink the experience with the tracking your package and share with us your story - because it requires some attention of a social media schedule to show people how to do it and why to do it (a 3 posts slide would work) and sent Suheil two templates that can help with the posting, reminding to use our own identity. The time was 23:20 to 00:29.
[6/21/23, 9:16:26 AM] Suheil - Europe: Which starting level business or project makes it viable to spend 7-10k on only design !
[10/26/23, 8:33:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I saw it.
[6/21/23, 9:16:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: U need licensing u need to start selling u need to pilot

[6/21/23, 9:42:07 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: Thats value equal to what we spend on out product.
[10/26/23, 8:37:55 PM] Gary Teh: That is wonderful!

Will follow up with @16468233438 when I meet him tomorrow to get more details about the night market

Also we are going to be partnering up with Edge and Node for their anniversary celebration event on the 9th of Nov
[6/21/23, 9:43:57 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: We have a single goal. Sell nibs on Amazon. Make profit.   Move forward slow and steady.
[10/26/23, 8:38:49 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Obs: we should have a section with pictures from the events that redirects to the Instagram as well. As it is done in the shop part. Any opportunity we can use to make people curious about Agroverse, we should use.
[6/21/23, 9:45:30 AM] Suheil - Europe: Agree
[10/26/23, 8:39:14 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I wrote some "what I get in return if I go to your event?"
[6/21/23, 9:45:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: We are bootstrapping its about advancing not spending :)
[10/26/23, 8:42:40 PM] Emelin - Bahia: "You will taste our fine cocoa drink and benefit your diet by having the opportunity to talk to our collaborators and learn more about the world of cocoa."

[6/21/23, 9:47:42 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: But bootstrapped
[10/26/23, 8:43:06 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This should follow as well to social media.
[6/21/23, 10:16:10 AM] Anupa/diya: The fact that work has been already done has to be taken  into account . What we can do is the work done till now gets tokenized. 

We can look into the second option and see which one is opted by the DAO  

However going forward. We should have a bid for any  given work and the dao should choose.
[10/26/23, 8:43:34 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Always tell the benefits of being there and not saying "you can taste". Just "you will taste"
[6/21/23, 10:16:43 AM] Anupa/diya: Mid way selections are counter productive
[10/26/23, 8:43:51 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok, now going to sleep
[6/21/23, 10:18:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: Rephrase the voting and let's vote :)

The voting should say:
Should we spend 7k to re do another set

Such make huge difference.... according to my personal opinion :)
[10/26/23, 8:45:40 PM] Val Lapidus: As far as I know no tickets necessary
[6/21/23, 10:19:45 AM] Anupa/diya: We can see which direction with both the options but let this just be for now.
[10/26/23, 8:47:42 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is a wix thing. If it is paid or free they generate a ticket but there says it is free just right away, I added to the title. I will look again tomorrow how to drift this feature they have. They generate a ticket even if it is free.
[6/21/23, 10:28:17 AM] Gary Teh: Please update your vote
[10/26/23, 8:47:49 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will go further tomorrow.

[6/21/23, 10:41:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: Vote
[10/26/23, 8:55:32 PM] Val Lapidus: How many new followers did we get today?
[6/21/23, 10:41:58 AM] Gary Teh: You can choose to abstain as well.
[10/26/23, 9:00:13 PM] Val Lapidus: Our event was great everyone loved the hot chocolate and our CTA felt like it resonated.  I covered three major points in my convos:
1.  Cabruca farming
2. 36% vs 6%
3.  Blockchain to document supply chain

And closed with give us a follow on insta

We met a reporter Rachel Wolfson who reports on web 3 projects and hopefully we can nurture that relationship.
[6/21/23, 10:42:19 AM] Suheil - Europe: The question is wrongly formulate
[10/26/23, 9:27:51 PM] Val Lapidus: Spent 1.5 hours just now. Cleaning up after our cacao making exercise

[10/26/23, 10:03:19 PM] Gary Teh: Me and @16468233438 spent 4 hours from 3pm to 7pm just now doing the event at Edge and Node 

*Time taken: 4 hours*
[6/21/23, 10:44:32 AM] Gary Teh: Please note that members can also choose to create a new poll and then vote on that. I don't have dictatorship rights to that. üôÇ
[10/27/23, 5:02:21 AM] Suheil - Europe: + 13

[6/21/23, 10:45:32 AM] Suheil - Europe: Simply doesn't represent the reality ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[10/27/23, 9:34:26 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm about to send this to designer for a menu mockup:  please provide feedback if you have some: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OT7Gn1k1GvPIpb4vUlC1CRtiygxvXpP6Nuznc2oSHsk/edit
[6/21/23, 10:46:57 AM] Anupa/diya: We have to see which part of the process we can do this kind of intervention.

We can somewhat still do it but from the way forward We have to project management better 

If we have multiple people wanting to do the same thing.. which is fine.  We need to have the selection process before the work starts 

On the website .. we should add potential roles for execution . Please can submit their proposals and the DAO works
[10/27/23, 9:53:44 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What designer are you hiring? I have a recommendation of someone from here.
[6/21/23, 10:46:59 AM] Gary Teh: If Alessandro and his wife wants to spend GBP 7K of their own free will to advance the DAO, then it is their choice to do so.

What is within our scope is to clearly identify what they are trying to contribute and then determine if it will be of use to us.
[10/27/23, 9:54:23 AM] Val Lapidus: i have a personal friend that does all the work for me
[6/21/23, 10:48:05 AM] Anupa/diya: The Finance is one thing but it's also acknowledging the time and effort that is put in.
[10/27/23, 9:54:46 AM] Val Lapidus: he is a contributor to the DAO
[6/21/23, 10:51:12 AM] Gary Teh: The reality that second set of designs are still up in the air. Who knows they might just change their mind after my email response to them. 

The universe will take care of itself. I spend my time on items on the critical path.
[10/27/23, 9:54:52 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok. In case he can't help, I have someone close to me as well.
[6/21/23, 11:04:31 AM] Gary Teh: Please just submit your vote and let's move it. I will base my follow up actions with Alessandro and Maria according to the outcome of the vote.

Also once they provide the itemized breakdown of the items they would like to contribute, we can discuss here and then pick and choose what we need regarding items from the list.

I would be curious about how the logo and packaging rendition would look like based on their interpretation of the brand positioning and mood board that Fatima crafted. 

The recent portfolio they submitted as reference seems really well done

https://www.goldenleafoflondon.org/

Also if what they say is true, they will be putting a full time employee on the tasks. So timeline wise, it is likely execution speed via that route might end faster than @972543523823 who only has weekends to work on this. So very likely both set of designs will become available at around the same time. So timeline wise, we should not be expecting much additional delay in the execution of our critical path.

The fact they will be able to throw in a website is a huge bonus. This is taking into account, other than Shadi who has been brought in to work on the website, no one else in the DAO has bandwidth for that. And Shadi is not able to execute at the pace expected had I the bandwidth to do the execution myself. 

My sense given his kind of pace, we will only expect a main website up by end of this year (if it happens) the earliest we will be expecting a dedicated site up for Agroverse via Shadi's route will be end of next year. 

So in conclusion, when I surface propose, I always have timelines and deadlines accounted for in the back of my mind.
[10/27/23, 9:55:03 AM] Val Lapidus: ty!
[6/21/23, 11:54:34 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a break now. 

Items 1,24 are completed. Will work on item 3 once I get back
[10/27/23, 10:11:39 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps a profit share model with each event organizer.

*Flat fee*
DAO bears the risk of both inventory and storefront 

*Profit share* 
risk shared between event organizer and DAO. 


*Profit share*
Seems more scalable since the only risk DAO bears is inventory risk which we are bearing at cost

Incentives are aligned

Otherwise event organizers organize a shitty event and DAO paid for shitty event ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[6/22/23, 5:13:24 PM] Gary Teh: @17782305576 is right now getting the quotation for lab testing from the various labs 

Would be great to get the quotation from your friend too
‚Äé[10/27/23, 10:29:40 AM] Gary Teh: ‚Äéimage omitted
[6/22/23, 7:57:00 PM] Gary Teh: Primarily the strategy around our initial distribution channel is keyword based growth hacking. There are keywords when used in the amazon listings will boost visibility and drive sales. So long as we know there is demand then its primarily about optimizing the use of these keywords when generating the product listings
[10/27/23, 10:33:58 AM] Val Lapidus: We should be targeting events that have decent venues that guarantee a certain number of attendees. I think there are ways to mitigate this risk by doing research on the event seeing past event participation, talking to vendors who were at the event previously, things like that can certainly mitigate the risk
[6/26/23, 6:47:38 AM] Gary Teh: Personal Focus for the day

[10/28/23, 8:57:21 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: As it is a shade-tolerant plant, it grows well in understories and thin forests, making it an extremely conservationist crop for soil, fauna and flora. Little mechanized, it is a culture that provides a high degree of employment generation. It found in the south of Bahia one of the best soils and climate for its expansion.

The State of Bahia is the largest producer in Brazil, but its production capacity was reduced by up to 60% with the advent of witches' broom, caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, currently Moniliophthora perniciosa.

The cocoa production system in Bahia is known as cabruca, an agroforestry system, where the fruit is grown under trees in the Atlantic Forest, having great importance for the preservation of the forest.

[6/29/23, 5:14:49 PM] Gary Teh: Once our minimal viable trade route is established continuous expansion of marketing channels and adding of SKUs to the network is important to actualize this vision for this specific trade route
[10/28/23, 9:04:28 PM] Val Lapidus: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead

Lead content is harmful to humans in large quantities and people often are concerned about lead within their food

[6/29/23, 5:47:45 PM] Gary Teh: I noticed they also produce rapeh in Brazil as well. 

It is almost starting to feel like there might be a ceremonial organic produce segment to be served somewhere in the USA

Right now the distribution channel is unclear. And no, one and one direct sale is not a scalable go to market strategy.
[10/28/23, 11:18:17 PM] Anupa/diya: @16468233438 might be of some inspiration

For a more detailed view of the diagram, please reference here
https://truesight.me/dao/agroverse/progress

Items on the hot seat:
----
    - DApp to allow DAO members to vote on rake rate (Myself and @31641075825 )
    - Legal document to make corresponding NFT issue binding (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Legal document to enforce proper use of funds gathered from NFT issue (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Exclusive distribution rights agreement signed with Bahia Brazil (myself)
    - Content for product listing page (@918017107841 let us know if you are already done and @972543523823 can take over)
    - Create GS1 barcode number (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)
    - Figure out the exact warehousing location to ship our goods to in USA (Me)
    - Follow up to ensure DUNS number is finally issued (Me)
    - Define go to market strategy (I am aware that @31641075825 promised to do it. Ay this point, I doubt he has the bandwidth to undertake this. I am inclined to relief him of this)
    - Content for Amazon seller profile page (@918017107841  please let us know when the first draft will be available)
    - Get TradeMark registered (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)

[10/29/23, 9:22:21 PM] Gary Teh: From @16203326626
[7/6/23, 6:17:10 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus for the day
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
    - create the google form to allow DAO members to vote on rake  rate. 

        - this will help determine the commission rates to charge for the loan proposal that @554792626338 is surfacing

        - this will also help determine the mark up rate for the cacao raw materials that @573136732781 is trying to buy from the DAO that we right now have in stock
[10/29/23, 9:23:47 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002  could you check through the document that @16203326626 shared to see how we can further lower lead content within cacao nibs imported for future shipments 

Current level is still 10X of FDA recommendations
[7/6/23, 11:00:07 AM] Gary Teh: - this will also inform the pricing markup which we will be presenting to the Brazilian buyer on the healthcare products  sourced from USA
[10/29/23, 9:26:03 PM] Gary Teh: there's also this blog post that has a rough summary of that huge report:  https://www.asyousow.org/blog/2022/8/17/new-report-explains-simple-safe-and-low-cost-solutions-to-reduce-levels-of-lead-and-cadmium-in-chocolate

[10/29/23, 9:28:32 PM] Dean Mao: if you buy your competitors (like navitas) they have a proposition 65 sticker on their packaging
[7/7/23, 8:00:51 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: I personally use 4 - 25
[10/29/23, 9:29:41 PM] Dean Mao: but I think some of their packaging does not have this sticker because some nibs that were grown in peru had less lead content and fell under the threshold where a sticker is needed
[7/7/23, 8:01:53 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: I'm thinking about it for this.
[10/29/23, 9:32:20 PM] Dean Mao: but yeah this is a big problem that only recently got lots of news coverage:  https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/a-third-of-chocolate-products-are-high-in-heavy-metals-a4844566398/

I doubt it‚Äôs for Mailan‚Äôs facility 

What I am aware is that there are three processing facilities for roasting, cracking and winnowing 

Each farmer has their own fermentation and drying facility 

There are more than 600 plus farmers in the network. 

Seems like a great use case for using blockchain to track the supply chain network 

That way when a report is issued and the lead and cadmium is above threshold we will know which facility in the network is faulty and needs rectification
[7/10/23, 4:35:09 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus today:

what are the disadvantages to using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product
ChatGPT
Using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product can raise ethical and practical concerns. Here are some of the disadvantages:

Exploitation: It can be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals for commercial gain. Homeless people may be desperate for money and may agree to participate in marketing campaigns under coercive or exploitative conditions.

Stigmatization: Involving homeless individuals in marketing and sales may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas associated with homelessness, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of this group.

Dignity and Privacy: It may compromise the dignity and privacy of homeless people. Marketing and sales activities often involve public exposure, which can infringe on their personal space and comfort.

Unintended Consequences: Using homeless people in marketing may draw negative attention or backlash, leading to unintended consequences for both the brand and the individuals involved.

Ethical Concerns: Ethical questions can arise about whether the compensation and support provided to homeless participants are fair and adequate. This includes concerns about fair wages, working conditions, and access to healthcare and social services.

Short-Term Solution: Using homeless individuals in marketing and sales does not address the root causes of homelessness, which are primarily related to housing, employment, mental health, and social safety nets. It may be seen as a short-term, superficial solution to a complex social issue.

Dependence on Exploitation: Relying on homeless people for marketing and sales may perpetuate a system where vulnerable individuals become dependent on such opportunities instead of receiving appropriate support and assistance.

Risk to Brand Reputation: Associating a brand with the use of homeless people in marketing can lead to backlash, harm brand reputation, and result in boycotts or negative public sentiment.

Legal and Regulatory Concerns: There may be legal and regulatory challenges, such as ensuring that all participants are adults who have provided informed consent. Employing homeless individuals without addressing labor and employment laws could lead to legal issues.

Lack of Expertise: Homeless individuals may not have the necessary expertise or training for marketing and sales roles, potentially affecting the effectiveness of the campaign and customer experience.

It is important for businesses and organizations to consider these disadvantages carefully and explore alternative ways to support homeless individuals that are more ethical and sustainable. These may include partnering with charities and organizations, providing job training and housing assistance, or actively participating in efforts to address homelessness in their communities.
[7/13/23, 8:18:22 AM] Suheil - Europe: written on it
[10/30/23, 10:58:38 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 that's not to say I am against hiring of homeless.  On the contrary, I'd be happy to hire them for package and back of house activities, and am happy to pay them more than minimum wage.
[7/13/23, 8:19:49 AM] Gary Teh: The associated brand also needs to be already registered in their brand registry.
[10/30/23, 10:59:40 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you use homeless in your marketing/sales you will jeopardize our brand and our marketing efforts for franchising
[7/13/23, 8:20:13 AM] Gary Teh: The trade mark needs to be registered with the US government before the brand can be accepted into their registry
[10/30/23, 11:00:54 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you are going to conduct experiments with homeless in sales/marketing than please do so using a different brand other than Agroverse, and only once the efforts are deemed successful you can attempt your experiments on Agroverse.
[7/13/23, 8:22:30 AM] Gary Teh: I will also be sourcing for a certified kitchen facility in Silicon Valley which I could utilize by the hour to pack the cacao nibs into. 

That way, the 22 bags of cacao nibs created from the 5KG of supply can be sold in the USA without too much concerns since the manufacturing facility used in the USA is already on the FDA registry
[10/30/23, 11:01:22 AM] Gary Teh: Dan runs a social program that is rehabilitating the homeless. Those are looking for jobs.

Those folks in the photos are not homeless they are peddlers
[7/13/23, 8:37:00 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: I could get this in detroit
[10/30/23, 11:06:40 AM] Gary Teh: technically they are no longer homeless as they are being housed by Dan's facility right now
[7/13/23, 8:37:20 AM] ‚Ä™+57¬†313¬†6732781‚Ä¨: The org is called foodlab

[10/30/23, 11:14:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: maybe start with one person and see how it goes.
[7/13/23, 9:31:18 AM] Gary Teh: I see it more as a network of polyamorous commercial relationships

Mono (single) and gamy (exclusive) are not what I have in mind.
Rather Poly (many) and amorous (non-exclusive) feels more appropriate.
[10/30/23, 11:14:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Second person you guys would have more experience about what can go sideways and yet, would not put that much of time, something you don't have right now.

and we need to get them an email of some questions.
@557391090002 for the blend that we are doing, how did we decide on those four farms.  Are we able to source from a single farm?  Do you have a website for the Cacao institute that will be doing the testing of our nibs?

Since @16468233438 is doing the execution it‚Äôs his call how he wants to modify the products to become drinks instead 

While @16468233438 was busy I was messing around with the recipe. Since it was my execution, while @16468233438  has his opinion, since I was doing the execution, I did it my way 

I know Annia designed the T-Shirt but since @16468233438was placing the order with the printer he could decide which design he wants

But since I was paying for the shirts when I picked them up, it was my call to buy another t-shirt for the homeless whom I wanted to run a social experiment on

[10/31/23, 10:33:04 PM] Gary Teh: When I was at the Crypto Rockstar conference in Germany earlier in the year, I had the opportunity to speak to the company that Jakob hired to help line up the sponsors for him to close.

It sees there is one person in charge of building the database and another in charge of warming the lead to get to an appointment before Jakob comes in to close the sponsorship deal

It feels like a human supply chain ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[7/17/23, 8:14:21 PM] Anupa/diya: That's why they can't send you samples due to shipping. It must be from the same place I got the stuff.
[11/1/23, 3:04:04 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Good morning guys! A had a conversation with Orlantildes yesterday night. I belive we had a misunderstanding here.  When u guys asked me about the lead on the Cocoa and I talked to Orlantildes about it he didn't notice that I was referring to your Nibs. He thought that it was about a general research that's why he sent me a test made by OFI relative a Cocoa that pass through a industrial method and it  and not a test made by CIC directed to our nibs. Nibs as u know it's about the bean dry toasted and broken and nothing more.

*Outputs*
    - all operations related communications between TrueTech Inc should be handled between @16468233438 and Orlantildes in the future. We should not be utilizing any one else in the guild as intermediaries. 

    - @16468233438 please compile as list of what you want to follow up on with Christino from CIC

    - the load placed on @16468233438 right now is too much. Proposed to reduce scope for @16468233438 

    - exit interview was performed on @5511982667030 who will be leaving the Agroverse project upon arrival of 100kg in USA

    - continued membership in this guild is determined on whether you have an active agenda you are actively pursuing within the scope of this guild

[7/28/23, 8:08:40 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus today
====

    - register our brand with Amazon 

    - setup meetup.com account

    - setup Eventbrite account
[11/3/23, 6:03:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: according to my knowledge that instagram algo differentiates between high-quality posts (specifically the ones that promote sales) and personal.

Your mini-documentary is good for attracting viral audience to build up the community around the philosophy/concept . but we would be very lucky if we can hit 2 birds one stone aka also a concept soldiier and a buyer/client
[7/28/23, 8:23:25 AM] Val Lapidus: That's a lot to manage.  I'd do it for governance tokens
[11/3/23, 6:04:07 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you need to follow up with Orlantildes to get any reference number that Omega services might have issued Coopercabruca for the cacao shipment that is being sent to them in Salvador 

That way, when you reach out to Omega services and attempt to follow up with our cargo to understand the arrangements they have setup with SeaCoastLogistics they will know what we are talking about 

You can get @5511982667030 to support you if you need. Feel free to exercise your autonomy. Critical point is make sure this shipment does not fall through the crack anywhere in the interfacing and disappear 

*Omega services*: outbound freighting company based in Salvador 

*SeaCoast Logistic*: customs broker based in USA

PS: I am making a huge assumption that there is in fact a reference number here. Perhaps there is none. That is for you to go figure out ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[11/3/23, 6:06:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: i can‚Äôt advance the instagram under ‚Äúcorporate sales‚Äù push before it gets surrounded by the community concept/

as corporate sales can easily eliminate the community aspect thus showing us as just ‚Äúbllablaer‚Äôs‚Äù and utilizing social as a pretext to just sell a product ü§∑

[11/3/23, 6:11:54 AM] Suheil - Europe: ok quiick anallysis of what u sent:

- instagram page with fiirst post 21/02/2020 = beginning of building his instagram community

- a pure product sales page = very clear set of target client and simple  call to actiion ‚Äú come buy‚Äù
VS our caase

we are telling all stories about farmers and sustainability and change and innovation and and and then oh  please buy to support thee mission
[7/28/23, 8:34:44 AM] Tess walkowski: I want to do a white chocolate with raspberry and could use nibs for that but need the cacao butter too and vanilla lol

[11/3/23, 6:16:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: exactly my point that iit took him that long to reach 3k which obviously they did organic and surrounded the right audience . 

As a designer you are heavily active offline which then get translated into ‚Äúinstagram‚Äù . I would be pretty astonished if designer tells me ‚Äú ii succeeded to generate my online ssales oonly from instagram‚Äù
[7/28/23, 9:37:06 AM] Gary Teh: something like this might us serve well

Tear out the four backseats and we are done. 

All 90kg can be stored in the space that are freed up. 

We can park it by ocean beach SF. The weather is generally chilly here anyways.

[11/3/23, 6:18:11 AM] Suheil - Europe: fashion and clothing iindustry is annia‚Äôs expertise. in fact, what made anniia loose her mind with us is that she iis not understanding why we are focusing on community and not just setting up a traditional business page ü§∑ 
her reaction was liitteraly like : ‚Äú i dont understand what you guyz are doiing filming yourself for an instagram page to sell cacao ‚Äú hhhh
[7/28/23, 10:24:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Sorry Gary, this is a bad idea. It will get broken into and everything inside of it will be stalled

[11/3/23, 6:21:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: i cant put KPI‚Äôs on building a community 
I can put KPI‚Äôs in business language and it will require budgets because i never saw in my life a business succeeding to push onliine sales under a business mode without setting up a long term execution budget for online marketing (like even if its only 100$ /month budget for 12 months doesnt matteer whats the amount but the algo needs money to push sales prooduct

Once we are done with our focus group, I suggest that we arrange a Zoom session where we meet up to share the insights we have gathered. Thereafter we do a poll to figure out which components in each stage of the AAARR to prioritize since there are literally a whole bunch of options available at each stage.
‚Äé[11/3/23, 5:12:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‚Äéimage omitted
[7/30/23, 4:00:33 PM] Gary Teh: As @5511982667030 has suggested the other DAO members do not have enough of in-depth context on our project, so prioritization of options voting will be done within this guild

As and when we need help and support we could reach out to the larger DAO via the townhall or the beer hall

That way we could  reduced noise in our collaboration efforts, be more focused in our execution, be more selective in when we tap into the larger DAO thereby also reducing noise levels in the main channels üôÇüëç

If the agricultural cooperatives we are getting our supplies from ends up failing to help us with the packaging and we have to assemble it ourselves and we figure there is demand for powder form too, we might end up assembling the cacao powder bags in a commercial kitchen here in SF

I am sure we will need to print another version after this current version

[7/31/23, 10:42:30 PM] Anupa/diya: I was going to suggest the same so the synthesis can feed into the main insights

‚Äî‚Äî
    - recruit 6 participants for the 20th august offline focus group in San Francisco from the Facebook groups targeted
[11/4/23, 10:44:43 AM] Anupa/diya: I went to this lovely chocolate store today and they had a very nice experience of chocolate making process.  They tapped into the 5 senses
[8/2/23, 8:14:09 AM] Tess walkowski: Same issues on stickers and labels
[11/4/23, 10:45:43 AM] Anupa/diya: It got me thinking.... if you guys want... at your events... maybe along with the tasting.. you might want a virtual vr space to experience with cacao making.

I could set something up on spatial.
[8/2/23, 8:16:41 AM] Iwona Fluda: Does the packaging need to be sustainable?
[11/4/23, 10:46:03 AM] Gary Teh: That would be quite cool! How would that work??
[8/2/23, 8:18:08 AM] Anupa/diya: You should ask them what is the issue. The only issue I see couldn't be the dpi High print or they needed an open file. I feel you can just go to neighborhood printer
[11/4/23, 10:46:30 AM] Anupa/diya: Given your costing now. Let's do a prototype
[8/2/23, 8:20:20 AM] Gary Teh: What is the context behind this question?
[11/4/23, 10:47:02 AM] Gary Teh: Is it a website or needs a VR headset?
[8/2/23, 8:22:43 AM] Iwona Fluda: Positioning, etc. I run a social enterprise here in Switzerland, and my aim is to create a 360 degrees social enterprise. That means that all steps on the way need to be social and sustainable. This is also great for positioning, not just because part of my heart beats for it.
[11/4/23, 10:47:26 AM] Anupa/diya: I can use spatial to build a story telling and you guys can get an oculus on rent for people to experience the spatial
[8/2/23, 8:23:43 AM] Iwona Fluda: With the assumption that keto nerds might be also socially and environmentally aware, this could be a great differenciator
[11/4/23, 10:47:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Spatial is like a free metaverse
[8/2/23, 8:24:10 AM] Gary Teh: We will hopefully gain some insights on this during the focus groups
[11/4/23, 10:47:47 AM] Anupa/diya: You can use the laptop or you can use vr to access it
[8/2/23, 8:24:39 AM] Iwona Fluda: P.S. as a nerd myself, I would go for it :P
[11/4/23, 10:48:03 AM] Anupa/diya: We can add all the videos and footage
[8/2/23, 8:24:52 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is a medicine of the heart, so it makes sense, and the tree grows best like the heart wild and free
[11/4/23, 10:48:12 AM] Anupa/diya: Photos and set up a gallery
[8/2/23, 8:25:23 AM] Tess walkowski: I was thinking about cacao ceremonies for nerds as a fellow nerd
[11/4/23, 10:48:45 AM] Anupa/diya: You guys can play that on site while having the events with vr
[8/2/23, 8:26:04 AM] Iwona Fluda: Im in! Also: just stopped drinking coffee a few weeks ago and move to cacao and matcha.
[11/4/23, 10:49:01 AM] Gary Teh: That would be quite an interesting concept and aligns well with our theme of *Saving our Rainforest with Web3*
[8/2/23, 8:26:51 AM] Tess walkowski: Matcha would also be great to source and import and it's a great comparison
[11/4/23, 10:50:20 AM] Anupa/diya: If you guys can get a vr.. let's do it. I know last year it was huge at the web 3 events.
[8/2/23, 8:27:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Preparing matcha is a ritual
[11/4/23, 10:50:25 AM] Anupa/diya: And it's fun.

[8/3/23, 11:22:32 AM] Gary Teh: While we await for participants, I was thinking through the following aspects of the go to market for our keto cacao nibs 

*The channel*
Which social media platforms to utilize Instagram, YouTube, TikTok‚Ä¶

*The method*
Paying for ads or getting influencers to do the promotion  

*The format*
Text, videos or photos as the primary format 

Once we figure out what the Unique value proposition (UVP) is, we will need to package the UVP and deliver it on the right channel, using the right method and the right format 

*paramters*
The parameters to consider are

    - cost: how much does it cost to. More competition more costly. More channels more costly.
 
    - reach: how many people naturally hang out at the channel 

    - uniqueness: how much can our messaging stand out. More competition using the same format less unique
[11/4/23, 10:47:53 PM] Gary Teh: Here you go
[8/3/23, 11:23:27 AM] Gary Teh: Would be great to get some new ideas on 

    - channel
    - method 
    - format

Once we figure out one that works, I propose we should just double down on it till we hit channel saturation

That way I can compile the performance information and have it shared in the Townhall with the rest of the governance tokens holders

@16468233438 until now has not logged into the Amazon account yet

The only folks who have done so thus far are you (@918017107841 ), myself and @31641075825 

I am thinking since @31641075825 and Annia are working on Instagram, perhaps you should oversee Amazon

That way @557191035605 can oversee Wix

Which leaves @16468233438 to just focus on the farmer's market, events sponsorship and fulfilment stuff

That way, customers will be compelled to want to buy another package from us to participate in the same game again next month and win. 

Every month is a new round

These were left by Anika who was active in our DAO last year when she was fanatical about NFTs. She has since became inactive, I believe she lost a whole bunch of life savings from her parents investing them in NFTs.

Nevertheless the education materials she acquired are still useful for the NFT campaign that you are working on

the bulk of the consensus is the guild just wants to stick to nibs 

Any processing beyond the nibs stage, it is independent of the dao 

The exception would be it is a product that was created in its final form on the farmer‚Äôs end and past through DAO network for distribution in USA

The model becomes cleaner in this regard

Rather than becoming a manufacturer we stick to being a distributor 

Otherwise a lot of the value captured along the supply chain needs to stay with us to pay for all these transformation expenses instead of passing directly to the farmers and the cooperatives where they should be ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[8/10/23, 10:45:53 AM] Gary Teh: If we plan to utilize FoodLens for traceability, FoodLens will charge us 3% of our retail price to generate QR codes linking back to their site which showcases the entire supply chain 

Makes sense to incorporate this if traceability so important that it drives consumer purchasing behavior 

If not, I am not sure why we are introducing this cost component that will eat into our profit margins
[11/6/23, 2:48:24 PM] Gary Teh: Also an insight that became apparent about our DAO after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

I feel we should play to our strengths instead of our weakness

From this perspective, manufacturing is not going to be our strength. Instead distribution is. 

We are not leveraging enough of our strength in distribution and kind of got alittl distracted in the manufacturing side of things ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 10:46:24 AM] Gary Teh: Could you further expand on this
[11/6/23, 3:58:06 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't necessarily agree with any of that.  But at the same time the only difference for me is that I can no longer tokenize the elements required to execute on the path that I'm currently on. I have full autonomy to execute whatever I want to. But now the guild will simply not share in the profit. If I happen to generate one instead, they will only see the benefit of me purchasing the nibs and potentially me reselling the nibs ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 10:50:34 AM] Gary Teh: *Key personal focus for today*

    - assemble actual package based on Brazil cooperative dimension

    - chat with @16468233438 about how to approach Dean on burning man 

    - figure out if we will use Shopify or a simple Wordpress shopping cart website for Agroverse consumer facing website 

    - reach out to one more financing professional (within John Tan‚Äôs network) to get a second opinion on the financing structure for the incoming shipments

[11/6/23, 7:15:41 PM] Anupa/diya: I think the events is a great idea. The retail bussiness is huge and it is a great source for marketing. However There is a huge initial expense involved and more than that it is a lot of work. 

In India there is a huge percentage of small to large  scale entrepreneurs who just sell via markets bazaars to large expos. They extremely well during the holiday seasons. I had seen in London, during the Christmas markets, mulled wine and hot chocolate were high selling drinks 

The Charlie and chocolate factory is releasing maybe some sort of buzz can happen around the Golden ticket 

@16468233438 you can create your own brand called Val's chocolate drink. That can be sub brand for agroverse

House of Balance has been trying to utilize this model to hold large scale events every year. The model doesn‚Äôt really facilitate that

When I think even more deeply of the organic behavior exhibited by DAO members over the past two years, I feel  it more readily lends itself to such kind of casual informal impromptu structures

If it is indeed true, then there might in fact be a use case for utilizing blockchain establish our track records of auditing our foreign suppliers to meet the FSVP program

This is because that will be when we pack the four bags of cacao nibs for burning man which @16203326626 will bring with him

[8/12/23, 7:17:12 PM] Val Lapidus: Also Gary with regards to a potential supplier of Peruvian nibs.  Would it be cost effective for us to do that?  Isn't the point that we are buying directly from the producer Farmer in Brazil or wherever and that is why we are getting a reduction in cost. Wouldn't the Peruvian supplier that has the product already in the US in his price include the cost of getting the product here. So what would be the point of buying from them unless we are handling the export? What are we adding to this? That makes it worthwhile?

[8/12/23, 7:24:13 PM] Gary Teh: You are correct 

It totally negates the story we are telling if we got the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

My original random stupid idea was that if people in the keto community doesn‚Äôt really care where the supplies come from then why not just get the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

But a lot more facts has surfaced since that random stupid idea and now to make it obvious that was a random stupid idea.

It is like us buying some stuff from Walmart and then trying to sell you the stuff for a margin when you could just walk down the street yourself and then buy it yourself or just buy online. Totally zero value adding

[11/10/23, 9:55:49 AM] Gary Teh: Back last year during the prediction market project, I have already setup the initial working prototype type for our own EVM based chain 

The code can be found here 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

Didn‚Äôt bother to do any further development as that was not the critical action

The critical action was Discovering and Validating a *viable business case* for TrueSight DAO

But as a bootstrap we can have the entries notarized on Ethereum or one of the EVM compatible chains work

At some point it makes sense is to have our own chain and miners as opposed to constantly paying another tech company gas/transaction fees. 

That was what lead to the thinking of *Sunmint* off the grid data center clusters where Our miners will be housed there. 

When I was in Bahia Matheus and Marcel offered their place to run miners. 

Hence it might not even be necessary for us to own the land where SunMint operates on. We run the nodes on the property of the farmers and the gas/transaction fees are paid to them

_PS: @‚Å®Val Lapidus‚Å© perhaps leave some portions of the 100KG unpackaged as my sense is some manufacturer might just want to buy in bulk_ ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[11/11/23, 12:05:14 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 thoughts on 16th arrangement?

*Option 1: 2 pronged operations*

Based on the inputs from Orlantildes, it seems having just one person at the airport will be more than sufficient to load the 100KG on to a rented uhaul van (approximately USD41)

That way you don‚Äôt need to be rushing over to the airport and then back to deal with preparing and making available the chocolate drinks for Edge and Node anniversary event

*Option 2: delay the pickup*

Have SeaCoast Logistics pick up the cargo from the airport and then we pick it up after the event. I am sure they will be charging something for that service. Not sure if it is going to be more expensive than USD41. Also judging by the dimensions of each box, I might need to get another transport before I could load the boxes in my car anyways. 

*Follow up*
Let me know your preference by Monday. So that I have enough lead time to arrange for logistics with U-haul services. ü§©

Are you sure it‚Äôs exactly 24 hours and not before clock strikes midnight of crossing from 16th to 17th of Nov?

There are some ambiguities there that needs clarification 

*Question 2*
Also SFO is a very large place. 

Which exact terminal or gate should we be heading to to pick up our cargo or are we even supposed going to be heading to the passenger terminals at all? 
Perhaps there is a specific facility we are supposed to report to to claim our cargo when we arrive for the pickup 

*Proposed follow up*
These are two questions you should want to clarify with Graziela on Monday when she is in the office. 

Let me know if you want to do the follow up instead. I only have very little lead time (Tuesday and Wednesday) to respond if _questions 1 and 2_ requires specific arrangements to be made. üôÇüôè ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[11/13/23, 11:18:49 AM] Gary Teh: He is a cook suitable for the kitchen

He is not suitable for sales 

Vendor has autonomy to do what vendor wants to. 

Just think of vendor as a separate company

DAO does not control how vendor handles things internally. 

And neither can DAO control how individual DAO member executes on things 

The only thing that DAO does is surface what can be proposed to DAO members. 

It is up to individual members to decide if he/she wants to invest personal time/resource/money in what is being proposed by DAO ‚Äé<This message was edited>

Once we know that figure as well as how much we owe US customs we will be able to float our second syndicate financing agreement for fiat investors to come in to provide the liquidity to finance this shipment

@5511982667030 has my Wells Fargo credit card 

@5511982667030 also has R$500 under her management 

For expected payments these three weeks, She can pay from the R$500 under management

If expenses goes beyond R$500 that she has with her right now, she can withdraw money using my credit card at one of their local banks‚Äô ATM 

This way is much cheaper to pay for smaller amounts of expenses incurred in Brazil (less than USD1000) than paying via International Wire transfer

*This is just an interim solution*

I am not expecting any large payments to Brazil side till end of the year. 

If need does arise that we pay for items above USD1000 before year end, it is recommended we do wireless transfer via USA bank 

In the future, beyond the end of this year, if our sales and marketing efforts in USA and Europe is successful and we believe there is a foreseeable need to make constant payments to Brazil suppliers, I will personally fly into Brazil and setup for a dedicated digital bank account and hook it up with PIX.

that way we can make future payments to suppliers in Brazil directly via PIX. Via this route we will not have to incur international bank transfer cost ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[11/20/23, 9:20:08 PM] Gary Teh: Feels I should probably infiltrate the kitchens of the *Vipassana meditation centers* after this as well as all the other meditation centers in California

With the exception of Vipassana which is donation based all the other meditation centers charge their clientele a crazy sum just to attend their retreats

As discussed and agreed upon, inviting you out of our guild 

@16468233438 will be the primary interface between Brazil and USA moving forward

[11/22/23, 3:25:30 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 This is the mailer I used 

https://www.dollartree.com/peel-seal-kraft-paper-envelopes-5-ct/361746



*_Key constrains*_
When combined with shipping labels from stamps.com, total shipping and material cost will be under *_USD6.50*_ which is what we are currently charging for shipping within USA. 

To stay under this cost each package shipped out must be under *_9 ounce*_ to stick to that shipping price 

Also packaging and mailer materials *must not contain plastic* otherwise our brand story of saving the rainforest totally falls apart, which means we will need to totally scrape the story that we are saving the rainforest and tell a totally different brand story for Agroverse. Right now I don‚Äôt even know what other compelling story to tell other than this one. 



*Worst case scenario analysis*
if our brand story doesn‚Äôt work and nothing sells, we will just donate our entire inventory to GoodWill during *Christmas 2024* and scrape the project. Since expiry date is within a year, we can‚Äôt sell it beyond *17th 2024* ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£

Write up by US government on the cabruca system and challenge farmers face due to low income/hectare.

increasing number of these land turning into pasture land (or chop down trees and grow soy beans) when farmers give up thereby adding to global warming ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[11/24/23, 5:38:28 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.truesight.me/agroverse

There is the link to the white paper on this page which talks about how our model aims to help the farmers using the cabruca method

This is achieved through reconfiguration of supply chain so they get paid 34% instead of the original 6% from the revenue proceeds of choclate sale ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[11/28/23, 12:36:01 PM] Gary Teh: Seems this _article_ as well as our _bag of cacao nibs_ sitting at the kitchen counter came in really handy for storytelling purposes 

Today is the off day for the entire community at the zen center

Randomly bumped into the manager in charge of procuring all the food supplies for the zen kitchen

She gave me an in-depth dive of the _user psychology_ when it comes to stocking their kitchen and how their supply chain works.

She loved the *_story of saving the rainforest*_  as well as the *_earthy design of the package*_ so much, she has offered to help setup an appointment with the *_procurement manager*_ of their Whole Foods supplier. Once we establish a relationship with the _*procurement manager_*, the hope is that they will start buying our cacao nibs in bulk

Also she has offered to drive me over to meet the _*procurement manager*_ once the Whole Foods retailer responses

She also mentioned that the zen center is geographically situated right at the heart of where our target demographic is located 

The universe is very visibly self aligning. ü§©üôè

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

[12/1/23, 8:02:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: heya Val, i‚Äôve received only 3kg directly from Brazil. I dont have the actual agroverse product. and thats what I need.

[12/1/23, 8:05:40 AM] Gary Teh: I was going to pass @41799155602 the packaging when I arrive in Switzerland

USPS provider should be charging maximum USd6.50 for each 8 ounce bag

[12/2/23, 9:12:02 AM] Val Lapidus: @Val, we are going through a moment of high volatility in the price of almonds and you can follow this on the website investing.com. This year cocoa has already increased by approximately 70% and continues to increase.
Despite this, we can, yes, grant a discount for larger volumes.

[12/2/23, 12:59:47 PM] Gary Teh: The most equitable approach would be for the commission pay out to be done fully in TDG only. 

People who wants to cash out their TDG for fiat needs to go exchange them at official venues 

Having a component in our comps that pays out Fiat directly to participants undertaking any DAO related activity also sends out a *_very negative signal*_ to people familiar with cryptocurrency tokenomics 

When I studied the tokenomics presented to me by Nio in Dubai (_*who does pump and dump professionally*_) that is usually the back door he uses to drain the fiat from any tokenomics system he comes up with

And that is exactly how Ethan did it for his project wonderhero, another mainland Chinese enabled *_pump and dump scheme*_ that took place in Singapore ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 1:02:04 PM] Gary Teh: I am open for the commission payout to be done in TDG

[12/2/23, 1:10:19 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to point out that the margins on the possible commissions are not all that high. Because our price is already high and compared to other vendors, we need to be able to stay competitive while also offering a feel good story.  And one more point, there's no reason that those of us that are in developing countries can't do sales in the US or for that matter. Any territory where we can import the product into and collect on those commissions.  I think with a decent internet connection, you can make phone calls into the US. Find vendors that you want to send the sample to communicate with those vendors, get their address where to send their sample and then ask me to send out the sample.
[12/2/23, 1:11:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Everyone in this DAO can become part of the go-to market, and sell the product

[12/2/23, 3:09:12 PM] Gary Teh: *Parts required*

1) verbal script that any DAO member can follow when telling Agroverse story 

2) a protocol which they can follow in DAO to work the script
[12/3/23, 4:48:54 AM] Gary Teh: For verbal script if someone want to come  up with an initial draft that has been tested to work, that would be great.

We can then modify this shared script as we use it to iterate with prospective buyers üôÇüôè
[12/3/23, 8:07:25 AM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply

[12/16/23, 10:30:22 AM] Gary Teh: Current pricing based on *3KG* from cooperative definitely will not match his target price‚Ä¶ 

Current rate is at *USD6.15* per pound

Perhaps check with Orlantildes to see what his price is 

Worst case scenario, since the purpose of Agroverse is to help restore the rainforest, then perhaps Agroverse could consider foregoing all profit taking from future transactions 

_*Scenario A: If potential USA buyers have their own FSVP process already setup*_

 we could consider just providing them the contact details of Orlantildes and they could just deal with Orlantildes directly. 

Meanwhile we stop further deployment of human effort behind Agroverse initiative and if human effort does get involved, people contributing effort should just consider it *_charity work*_

*_Scenario B: if potential USA buyer does not have FSVP process setup and wants to utilize Agroverse FSVP infrastructure*_

We charge a fixed one off fee for each purchase

But buyer will have to conduct all the aliasing themselves and logistics arrangements themselves

Service provided by Agroverse should just be considered a self service solution with minimal to no hand holding provided by any DAO member

Ideally the Agroverse website should just allow them to simply fill up a form and pay up to receive shipment from all prevetted FSvP approved cooperatives

Price to be charged is then up to the cooperatives to keep updated ‚Äé<This message was edited>

I have forwarded our Agroverse website and whitepaper to him. These along with three bags of samples I am bringing over to Switzerland with me will be featured during the Systemic Change Forum happening in Davos on the 13th of Jan. It will be in an intimate setting with a few participants. We will make some chocolate with these samples and share with the guests there

Meanwhile he has also extended invitation to another private forum that will be happening on the 17th. I understood that the CEOs of Unilever and Chanel will be present. During that session we will be exploring how we can transition our economy from one of fear and greed to one that is based on compassion üôÇüôè ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[12/27/23, 12:00:59 PM] Gary Teh: You definitely should. It will surface all your past trauma, mental and emotional blocks for you to work on during your 4 hour session consulting with the mushroom. It is a highly beneficial experience for people who seek to live life on the edge much like how you have been living. 

Much like ayuhuasca or even extended period of sitting meditation, you will come away from the experience with less needless striving in your life and more time just being in the state of flow by simply allowing the universe to naturally unfold.

Your efforts will help support the efforts of farmers who are working hard everyday to preserve this legacy for future generations

 https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/892/

It is not just chocolate you are buying. You are buying a future for your kids üôÇüôè

When you buy our cacao you know exactly which portion of this wonderous ecosystem your money is being channeled towards to help with ecosystem preservation and regeneration

Right now farmers are throwing in the towel and opting to sell off their land cheaply to mainland Chinese entrepreneurs who are then chopping down the forest to grow soy bean.

The reason they give up is because middle men are siphoning off the margins for their own personal gains. Siphoning off the future of your children ‚Äé<This message was edited>

Cost of buying and shipping 8 ounce of cacao nibs to Switzerland: USD13.46

Cost of Kraft pouch: USD0.64

I will leave it to you to decide the final price you want to quote Migros.

[2/6/24, 1:19:49 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I relooked into our costing of our most recent shipment from Brazil into USA

*Cost of the goods itself*
- 100KG cacao nibs: $R6500 = USD1,310.3846

*Cost of the transportation and customs* 
- _Leitl Express_ - Trucking from Ilheus to Salvador: $R1066.85 = USD215.11019
- _Omega Services_ - Air Freight from Salvador to SF Airport: $R4000 = USD806.53795
- _SeaCoast Logistics_ - Custom Clearance at SF Airport: USD561.03

If our goal is to bring cost per KG down to USD20 and still pay the farmers the fair price they are asking for than shipping and freighting cost needs to go down. 

Four options to optimize our supply chain bound for USA
- ‚Å†Find cheaper freight forwarding company
- ‚Å†Do sea freight instead of air freight
- Increase shipping volume to acquire economies of scale. _but first we need to decipher which cost is fixed and which cost is variable_
- ‚Å†Figure out how to do customs clearance ourselves to save on the USD561.03 by removing SeaCoast Logistics from the equation. _Doesn‚Äôt feel like Grazie is actually doing much for us but still charging us stuff_.

The ledger of records for the shipment could be found here
https://edgar.truesight.me/agl2

Time taken to perform cost analysis 30 minutes

[2/7/24, 9:23:34 AM] Patrick - Davos: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.
[2/7/24, 9:24:24 AM] Patrick - Davos: here is a snapshot of this framework, which can be transferred to out movements as well. Many others started out with same methodology, but only the URI survived 2008 and beyond to make a proof of point

_Requirements_
- QR code on package that links back to Agroverse.shop

- ‚Å†we are right now exploring organic cacao nibs sources from Africa. If it works out (_identified as good quality and no slavery_) we might need another version of our package design sourced from Africa.

Personally I haven‚Äôt really used the pitch deck. I mainly just walk up to them at their stores present the cacao nibs samples and have them taste it

And ask if they would be keen to place an order now or if not get their contact information to follow up again when they are at a time when they are ready to place an order

[2/10/24, 8:21:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: well first is to be in direct contact with consumers then you can drop them whatever we want
[2/10/24, 8:22:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: i was thinking from the perspective of QR code on the bought bag.

what you saay is also doable. mint your nft and receive your bag
[2/10/24, 8:25:02 AM] Gary Teh: The minting NfT route would only appeal to a smaller audience. Very effortful for none web3 folks 

I think the QR code on the cacao nibs bag approach will be more useful initially 

I am trying to minimize the effort that person has to spend comprehending the product ‚Äé<This message was edited>
[2/10/24, 8:25:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: the premier case is being used largely now by brands like L‚Äôoreal and others . brands that have no direct connection with their consumers as most of their products are sold via 3rd parties.

which can be our case when sold viia 3rd parties. but if we are anyways selling directly then NFT has no real use as we anyways have their direct contact database
[2/10/24, 8:26:45 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Let‚Äôs hold off on the NFts for now üôÇüôè
[2/10/24, 8:29:05 AM] Suheil - Europe: but now i re raise the attention, how come you say there is no direct linkage if we are talking about direct sales? if bag got sold directly via amazon or manually with your hands, we don;t have customers contact ?
[2/10/24, 8:35:53 AM] Gary Teh: If someone else sees the bag that is left on the table or the display, how do they even know there is a website associated with it??

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTu_eLpnjCT_rVvTPn0UrchxHGOpEeqYc3iemfEsgrw/edit

[2/14/24, 2:16:19 PM] Val Lapidus: Brazil in general does not have a good LCL corridor, they just don‚Äôt manufacture enough goods that are alike to be able to fill containers worth over and over etc. unlike China or Tiawan and so on.
[2/14/24, 2:16:29 PM] Gary Teh: Does it include cacao nibs price or is it just freighting cost?

[2/14/24, 2:17:01 PM] Val Lapidus: LCL:  less than container load
[2/14/24, 2:17:29 PM] Val Lapidus: This is just the shipping cost. It does not include the nibs or the customs fees.  Nor the customs broker
[2/14/24, 2:17:38 PM] Val Lapidus: I will do all the calculations when I come back from vacation
[2/14/24, 2:18:14 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm looking forward to finding out about cost from South Africa because we might get better rates there. Hopefully they have more exports that are similar to cacao nibs
[2/14/24, 2:18:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Which will allow for more options
[2/14/24, 2:19:51 PM] Gary Teh: @41764184108 still awaiting for you to propose your action plan for the next 90 days. It is also ok, if you would like to just hang out in the common areas while you figure out how exactly you want to contribute to this guild. Just let me know

- how to setup affiliate marketing on Wix using GoAffPro 3rd party app

[2/19/24, 7:38:37 PM] Gary Teh: How does this align with your personal OKR over the next 90 days? 

Or if your personal OKR has changed, do let us know what is it? 

Also how does this align with the goals of our guild for this year? üôÇüôè
[2/19/24, 9:21:42 PM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363044028036610@g.us* 

Exploitative middlemen diminish earnings for cacao and commodity farmers. Meanwhile, in developing nations, land is sold cheaply to Chinese corporations, transforming it into soybean and cattle farms, contributing to deforestation and climate change. How do we break this vicious cycle?
[2/19/24, 9:22:12 PM] Gary Teh: And this seems to be the set of hypotheses that @120363044028036610@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to crowdsource the setup and operations of a supply chain

- ‚Å†crowdsourcing can yield produces that restore communities and regenerates environment 

- ‚Å†integrity can be crowdsourced to tackle existing fraud in shipping industry which has caused banks to stop issuing Letter of Credits
[2/19/24, 9:30:43 PM] Gary Teh: Personal OKR for next 90 days 

*Objective*
- enable direct to consumer strategy 

*Key results*
- setup affiliate marketing program for USA territory via Wix 

- ‚Å†setup outreach script to use on influencers 

- ‚Å†test script on at least 25 influencers with at least 1000 followers and attempt to onboard them
[2/19/24, 9:49:41 PM] Gary Teh: _PS: upon closer examination of my personal OKRs, I am taking a step back from the direct to chocolatier objective_

_That objective is something that @16468233438 decided he wanted to undertake because that aligns well with his profile strength._

_I just realized I got distracted from my core focus when @12245781775, @41799155602 and @19209806391 reached out late last year regarding @16468233438 objective üò±_

[2/20/24, 5:53:04 PM] Gary Teh: This one would be what we would go for
[2/20/24, 5:56:15 PM] Val Lapidus: We have 1,000 bags printed and ready to go in the US.  Let's be cognizant of that fact
[2/20/24, 5:58:53 PM] Gary Teh: The cost of packing the cacao nibs into bags in USA is too high

What we could do is bring those 1000 bags over to Brazil in a hand luggage before the next shipment is prepared. That way, packing is done in Brazil instead
[2/20/24, 5:59:21 PM] Gary Teh: By the way has the Brazilian cooperative received what you shipped over?
[2/20/24, 6:00:41 PM] Val Lapidus: Let's make sure we work through the supply available in the Americas of The packed bags before we direct any packaging to happen in Brazil.  The only reason we would do a order right now for additional nibs in the US is to fulfill orders that are for large-scale bulk orders. We have no need for consumer product unless suddenly that channel starts making sales.
[2/20/24, 6:01:35 PM] Gary Teh: How is the status of the freighting cost?
[2/20/24, 6:02:00 PM] Val Lapidus: I will tabulate this information on the 23rd when I return home
[2/20/24, 6:03:56 PM] Gary Teh: It is important to lock down the business development task and make sure our package printing supplier based in Brazil have what they need to immediately start operating when we press the START button 

Otherwise that will hamper sales and marketing activities once that side ramps up

*Marketing 4Ps of our cacao nibs re-examined*

_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality because of care and deliberate attention during processing 
- ‚Å†the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ‚Å†fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ‚Å†leads to way more crunch 
- ‚Å†leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ‚Å†farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ‚Å†we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

Barter Faire is largest Van Life event in the whole USA. 40 acres of van lifers with 20 acres of vendors, a weekend of very intense partying and tripping out 

Will pop by at Elinor and Levi‚Äôs camp tomorrow to onboard Elinor on to our affiliate program as well as experiment making magic mushroom infused chocolate with honey

_PS: Chocolate mask the scent of magic nushrooms perfectly. Levi was just traumatized the last time he had to drive Lana bus from slab city now and pass through the border patrol check point_ ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[2/26/24, 9:25:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: so to make sure my lately dumb braiin gets it , just to update the bullet points mentioned iin the meessage of before?
[2/26/24, 10:00:32 AM] Gary Teh: Here are the bullet points:

‚Ä¢ Larger sized chunks for better quality and more crunch
‚Ä¢ Balanced taste due to careful processing
‚Ä¢ Fresher product with less time on shelf
‚Ä¢ More flavorful with a satisfying crunch
‚Ä¢ Sustainable farming technique that restores rainforests
‚Ä¢ Competitive pricing without sacrificing quality

These points highlight the unique selling points of our cacao nibs
[2/27/24, 9:02:24 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 How much lag time do you think you will need to pack the rest of the 300 bags of cacao nibs from our existing stock pile in California?

Some of the influencers have a very sizable following. In a home run scenario, we will be out of stock while demand still surges in. That will lead to bad reputation on our side and discourage these influencers from collaborating with us due to poor supply chain management. 

Let me know. What are you thoughts on calibrating demand to the supply that we have right now?

_PS: we have lost Neil for his influencer posting opportunity as he had to wait a month before receiving his shipment. And he is apprehensive that his followers end up experiencing the same wait time_ ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[2/28/24, 8:08:13 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like a well defined protocol at this point. 

Just need to populate the top of the funnel with leads gathered using GetData.IO and then manually work them through the pipeline

[3/2/24, 8:10:03 AM] Val Lapidus: seems like a grammatical mistake to me.
[3/2/24, 8:14:44 AM] Val Lapidus: also I believe our nutritional info is incorrect:
https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1890432/nutrients

at a quick glance this product has 6g of carb for 3 tbsp, which is not keto friendly at all.  
calculated by using: Total Carb (11g) - Dietary Fiber (5g) = 6g net carb
according to US FDA document that I linked above, it should be:
Total Carb(10g) - Dietary Fiber (8.99g) = 1.01 net carb which is much more Keto friendly

[3/6/24, 12:45:59 PM] Gary Teh: This feature has been very helpful in finding more similar influencers on tiktok to reach out to who are squarely situated in our primary target market - people trying to loss weigh
[3/6/24, 4:34:50 PM] Gary Teh: Before I left Switzerland Karin gave me a movie of her visit to investigate the cacao industry in Brazil 

I am going to start breaking down into smaller bitsized chunks and publish them on TikTok

[3/6/24, 8:25:57 PM] Gary Teh: Could you do an inventory check on how much loss cacao nibs we have and how many 8 ounce bags we have left
[3/6/24, 8:31:12 PM] Gary Teh: Will need to figure out the proper accounting treatment for this sale that does not cause an infarction into the agreement listed in shipment contract AGL2.

Basically if we are selling the 25kg right at the new price we will be selling it at a loss 

This doesn‚Äôt reflect well to future investors when we surface the financial performance history to them when we want to bring in the 1 ton cacao nibs‚Ä¶ aka USD21K++

_PS: I am short of liquidity on my side. I won‚Äôt be financing the next shipment. So if we can‚Äôt find any financiers to come up with the necessary capital to finance the USD21K, there is be no future Agroverse cacao nibs shipment into USA_

_hope it is becoming apparent why I am taking the profitability of this AGL2 shipment so seriously_

_I am using the performance of AGL2 as evidence that we have a working viable model for future fundraising purposes üôÇüôè_ ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[3/7/24, 3:48:51 AM] Gary Teh: After further consideration, there is No reason to justify offloading AGL2 inventory at a lost now

Direct to consumer Sales and marketing has just started revving up. 

If we start depleting our inventory at a loss before the effects of our sales and marketing efforts start manifesting, we will just end up shooting ourselves in the foot 

This will just reflect very badly to future investors in AGL contracts who can conclude the AGL contracts are managed by a bunch of incompetent imbeciles who don‚Äôt know what they are doing ‚Äé<This message was edited>

The registration number entry for importer was missing. I noticed TikTok listed it in our product listing product and updated it into our document.

It is the number we get when registering our company with FDA as an importer

[3/7/24, 1:35:55 PM] Gary Teh: TikTok‚Äôs free shipping policy is making our cacao nibs very competitive against Amazon free shipping policy 

The main difference is we don‚Äôt pay extra for customers to have the same benefits of free shipping
[3/7/24, 7:13:49 PM] Gary Teh: Actually before we place the order for that I will need to fly down to Ilheus to certify that facility that processes the 1 ton per month cacao otherwise we will get into problem with FdA during the audit
[3/8/24, 9:30:11 AM] Gary Teh: Discussion had with @16468233438 

Once we hit the 50 bags sold or 50% inventory depletion mark, I will pay a visit to our suppliers in Brazil to achieve two objectives 

- certify cooperative facility which processes 1ton of cacao nibs per month for export into USA

[3/8/24, 12:29:19 PM] Gary Teh: On cultural differences‚Ä¶

People from first world countries like Singapore, western Europe and America have very different expectations than people from 3rd world countries have very different expectations on how the world is supposed to work. 

Reminds me of my first time backpacking through Cambodia, a 3rd world country, when I was still in colleague 

It was a very frustrating experience but very insightful üôÇüôè

PS: once I got it in my head that time is very very flexible in 3rd world countries, the level of frustration drop to almost non-existence.

This approach is not going to be cost effective, time conserving and capital efficient 

*_Proposed alternative*_
Once minimal
Viable growth model is proven for chocolatier distribution route , we should start redirecting parts of the profits to retain the service of a call center to work through the sales lead list using a call script which have been tested to work. 

*_Advantages to this approach*_
- doesn‚Äôt rely on self-motivation

- ‚Å†doesn‚Äôt rely on whether contributor has time and availability to get stuff done 

- ‚Å†it becomes the employees full time job with a fixed weekly quota of calls he needs to hit. That will be defined in the SLA agreement we set in place with the call center
