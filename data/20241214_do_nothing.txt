I am Free, I am Free, I am Free, thank you for my freedom, Tha k you for my Freedom, Thank you for my freedom…

I have noticed if you can do the mantra for 17 seconds you will feel wonderful! 

At 68 Seconds you almost explode with great feelings… 💫🚀✌️

[10/19/22, 3:30:22 PM] Gary Teh: I was having a chat with @6594897484 when the topic of difference in nature’s law and man’s law surfaced and how this divide causes man’s agony and limits his ability to do nothing
‎[10/19/22, 3:30:26 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/19/22, 3:31:53 PM] Gary Teh: The most poignant example he brought up was when a man needs to take a dump (nature’s law) but he is stuck in the city of men and there was no toilet in sight and it was illegal to take a dump in public.
[10/19/22, 3:32:54 PM] Gary Teh: Closely aligning with nature’s law means taking a dump in public but breaking man’s law. But you get to do less 

Struggling to find a toilet to take dump publicly forces the man to do a lot 🤣
[10/19/22, 3:40:53 PM] Gary Teh: In that regard this particular rule in Tibet was most aligned with nature’s law 

I remember when I was passing through that region back in 2008. The usual morning routine would be to wake up brush my teeth and wash face at the sink, if you feel so inspired simply step outdoors and pick any spot in the fields in front of the house

[10/21/22, 12:33:47 PM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 just identified another group of people who needs a lisrnkng ear. 

They are folks in hospice about to die. These folks feel the most lonely too
[10/21/22, 3:01:10 PM] Francois renet: lots of people who are very sick, or end of life and could use the support. they just want to know they are not alone. The worst is always "why me?" and "what's after?". At least we can help find a way to answer why me? by showing that there are others in the same boat.
[10/21/22, 4:33:45 PM] Gary Teh: What a coincidence I was chatting with someone whom I bump into who is in the after life business a few nights ago 

One of our DAO member is also in the end of life business. Her elder care business is based in Taiwan 

There is a lot of demand as an ever larger percentage of our population age into end of life. The baby boomer generation is starting to die
[10/21/22, 4:34:58 PM] Gary Teh: How would u imagine we can help apart from setting up a service where end of lifers can reach out to for a listening ear?
‎[10/21/22, 4:43:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/22/22, 1:12:03 AM] Francois renet: i think it's a combination of being able to read other people's stories, contributing with yours, ability to connect in real time? and maybe, and i know how difficult this is, volunteers to hold someone's hand as they pass? nothing worse than to be alone in those last few moments.

[10/30/22, 4:14:34 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: Indeed..
[10/30/22, 7:36:18 AM] Gary Teh: Woke up this morning with an insight after a micro dose of magic last night 

Your identity is useful to the extent of helping people around figure out how to interface with you. 

If you are alone on the desert or a deserted island, your identity really doesn’t matter. 🤯
[10/30/22, 7:52:30 AM] Vlatko Gigov: https://opensea.io/collection/itsnothing-nft above 600 ETH traded since June.

[10/30/22, 8:13:11 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: probably nothing
[10/30/22, 8:15:15 AM] Vlatko Gigov: yep, their narrative is quite strong. Also remarkable design. 🤓 it’s probably nothing.
[10/30/22, 8:16:06 AM] Vlatko Gigov: very different to its nothing. 🕳
[10/30/22, 8:17:27 AM] Francois renet: less is definitely more when it comes to nobody's nothing!
[10/30/22, 8:19:08 AM] Brian -IOM: Looks like the price is on its way to nothing too 😅
[10/30/22, 8:20:36 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Your identity matters only to the extend society requires/makes you to engage. Once you are clear of those dogmas then your identity becomes truly your expression. Identity these days is based on utility, fear, power, wealth. Social status and the different layers around the globe is another form of identification. The future of identity requires us to get out of the current constraints and anticipate the future digital interactions. Processes are becoming more streamlined and networked. Our identities should become as well.

[10/30/22, 12:23:56 PM] Gary Teh: Started reading through these two books this weeks
[11/1/22, 10:09:33 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: This is well said! I signed up for a new social media platform recently called communivate. The owner has 10,000 hours in and seems a bit tired of re-iterating and carrying the rock. 
Anyway what I liked is that when you signed up it asked you what kind of role you would like to play in the context of meeting new people. After all, we are all just here playing roles for one-another in one sense or another! Appreciatively,
[11/1/22, 10:11:30 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: I was just thinking of this today ❤️
[11/1/22, 10:11:55 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: Just like Arya stark
[11/1/22, 10:12:00 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: 😂
[11/1/22, 10:42:21 AM] Francois renet: I had a long conversation with the founder too @17206665895 and yes, he was definitely tired of trying so hard with his platform! great potential, but the interaction and figuring out purpose is not easy, as is the ability to actually execute on visions.
‎[11/1/22, 11:07:28 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[11/1/22, 11:18:02 AM] Vlatko Gigov: State your purpose! Should be the first interaction after a clear manifesto of where the populous will head. The non-doer doer society should focus on the essence of humanity to manifest positive impact to others both physical and metaphysical. The constant intertwinement between the essence and personality in this world is apparent. We see traits of a typological persona projected through media and order. Comes to mind to ask: is it the best form of normality and progress?
[11/1/22, 11:22:37 AM] Francois renet: say what you mean, and mean what you say. don't talk, do! I think we have allowed words, buzzwords to become a very  shaky benchmark of someone's identity. Can we stop for a minute and actually look at ourselves in the mirror, and answer the question: How have i positively affected people in my ecosystem, or beyond?
[11/1/22, 11:23:58 AM] Francois renet: purpose should absolutely be the first step. the connection. after that it's figuring out skills and talent, and how to combine them to execute on vision to reach purpose.

[11/1/22, 5:48:51 PM] Gary Teh: That was also another theme that surfaced in the book! 🤩
[11/1/22, 5:50:19 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: He wants to create a Mentoring platform. He says that was his original vision. Sure it’s rough around the edges but he has “10,000 hours” in. That’s a lot of momentum! Appreciatively
[11/2/22, 7:38:35 AM] Vlatko Gigov: can you pls share a link to the primer you are hinting on.

Though the bulk of our members are mainly active only on WhatsApp 

I am actually looking forward to Meta’s new WhatsApp community features when they get rolled out
[11/14/22, 12:23:50 AM] Gary Teh: This might sound funny but you do know that reaching out and having social interaction (aka commiserating together) is actually a really good way to prevent depression.

Depression spun out of control is usually the case of a lot of folks choosing to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge (1% survival rate) 

At the end of the day, money is technically just a figment of imagine 🧘‍♂️

[11/15/22, 11:41:16 PM] Anita Lamprecht: According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, nothing can travel faster through space than the speed of light. This means a black hole's event horizon is essentially the point from which nothing can return. The name refers to the impossibility of witnessing any event taking place inside that border, the horizon beyond which one cannot see.
[11/15/22, 11:41:46 PM] Anita Lamprecht: this is how I feel since I am dealing with the topic metaverse and web3. it is like being in the state of an event horizon.

[11/16/22, 6:27:31 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: The idea is that everything is an inside job that nothing is outside of you. That as you go inside that you will allow more light through you like a lantern and that just based on your observation you will collapse the wave in a new way simply by BEing (the light) like you said. Appreciatively

Is the infographic there?
[11/17/22, 2:21:43 PM] Gary Teh: It should be embedded in the page

I utilize them alot as motivation boosters when crafting product experiences

Done properly they could almost double conversion rates at some steps of the funnel 

This is an example of a step that utilizes social proofing (one of those cognitive biases)

In this new paradigm Space/Nothingness is granted the same level of importance as Form. 

Just as Great music is defined as deliberate placement of sound and silence 

Great UI is defined as deliberate use of space to emphasis the content on a web page

[11/21/22, 4:04:52 PM] Gary Teh: I think the really interesting social experiment that we could potentially run is to figure out how much of existing economic activities we could right now drop before the Obesity problem starts fading away and the starvation problem starts surfacing

My sense to really get mass adoption of this, we first need to help people figure out how to still maintain infinite level of self esteem while engaged in being a nobody, achieving nothing, owning nothing and doing nothing. Right now due to the mind virus that has became so entrenched in much of the developed world, people equate their self esteem to what they have achieved. Not operating based on this narrative leaves them with the self esteem level of a door mat

If you would like staying in this group please do not persist in behavior that cause complains.  Otherwise you will be booted out 🙂🙏
[11/21/22, 11:39:15 PM] Dr. Denis: Relax bro, you can “do nothing” about naturally occuring and beneficial for humanity climate change. Global warming and resulting from it CO2 increase also allow to produce more food. Hence, another problem could be ditched out from your list 😅

[11/22/22, 2:41:34 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: The latest science does not support this statement at all…

I suggest we can “do nothing” and help reduce climate change by reducing consumption in general. Less food, less meat/dairy in particular, less clothes, less material goods. 

Live simply, in comfort, in harmony with nature 😌💚

“Do nothing” would help with so many environmental problems: climate change, ocean dead zones, soil nutrient depletion, habitat loss, species extinction, plastic pollution etc etc. The list goes on.

There is nothing natural about any of the things on that list, but we can “do nothing” to help! 😁

2) F**K it all, move into your car and park in front of those expensive rental properties for FREE!! 🤣

[11/22/22, 2:51:48 PM] Gary Teh: Let me go find some to rob along this stretch of coast line. 

It so deserted in some stretches you literally see nobody in some places 

The main problem with coastline in Singapore is there is so little of it with all the over population on that small little piece of land 

In larger places just drive out of town and help yourself. No reason working yourself to death over artificial scarcity 🤔

[11/23/22, 12:37:59 AM] Dr. Denis: Indeed, the “latest” (you forget to mention “junk”) science doesn’t like any theoretical & empirical evidence based objections to “Antropegenic Global Warming” hoax. True science (the one that recognizes historical climate change patterns, the laws of physics & chemistry and relies on real data rather than political demand) acknowledges a moderate increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere driven essentially by exogenous heat & magnetic fluxes + volcanic activity and finds it to be largerly beneficial for human beings and nature (warmer weather in cold areas, wetter and not hotter conditions in arid areas, more biomass growing, higher agricultural yields & more food for people, less extreme weather events due to lower Temp differential between hot & cold areas, etc). If we were to believe climate change culprits, like Alain Gore, the entire coastline would be already under sea, whereas the total land surface, even of small ocean islands, has increased over past decades according to observations from the satellites
[11/23/22, 2:50:24 AM] Dr. Denis: : . . . And when I was at Findhorn I met this extraordinary English tree expert who had devoted himself to saving trees, and he’d just got back from Washington lobbying to save the Redwoods. And he was eighty-four years old, and he always travels with a backpack because he never knows where he’s going to be tomorrow. And when I met him at Findhorn he said to me, “Where are you from?” And I said, “New York.” And he said, “Ah, New York, yes, that’s a very interesting place. Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave, but never do?” And I said, “Oh, yes.” And he said, “Why do you think they don’t leave?”
[11/23/22, 2:50:39 AM] Dr. Denis: And I gave him different banal theories. And he said, “Oh, I don’t think it’s that way at all.” He said, “I think that New York is the new model for the new concentration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves, and the inmates are the guards, and they have this pride in this thing that they’ve built—they’ve built their own prison—and so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners. And as a result they no longer have—having been lobotomized—the capacity to leave the prison they’ve made or even to see it as a prison.” And then he went into his pocket, and he took out a seed for a tree, and he said, “This is a pine tree.” And he put it in my hand. And he said, “Escape before it’s too late.

[11/23/22, 6:19:40 PM] Gary Teh: Good question, it might be the case climate change affects different regions differently 

Counter intuitively some regions further north and south might end up benefiting from warmer climates while other regions end up getting negatively impacted

[11/23/22, 10:53:04 PM] Anita Lamprecht: @Gary that would be great. I just need a bit of planning time ahead as I am «juggling« my family duties whenever I am travel.

[11/23/22, 11:18:26 PM] Dr. Denis: My position is that natural forces (Earth’s rotation cycles, solar activity, interstellar magnetism, volcanic activity) explain climate variability as it was the case over entire history of the planet. Most of time temperature and CO2 concentration were much higher. Currently we are standing at extremely low level close to life extenction. Thanks God recently (on geological time-scale) the Earth has started exiting from the little ice age and the conditions become a little bit more livable. Human contribution to increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is marginal (less than 10%) and largerly beneficial —> milder weather, less extreme weather events, more food due to CO2 fertilization. The idea that somehow people may prevent global warming by reducing CO2 emissions is absurd because it contradicts the basic laws of physics (Henry’s law and the 2nd law of thermodynamics) - there are much more heat stored in the ocean waters and the feedback loop between water vapor (main greenhause gas) and CO2 (minor trace gas) is negative according to the law of big systems which tend to stabilize themself. The idea that somehow it would be possible to reduce antropogenic CO2 emissions by using even more fossil fuels and extracting more minerals required for manufacturing quasi-renewable solar & wind power installations is criminal because it entirely relies on blatant carbon accounting fraud in upstream manufacturing industry, solar & wind power plants per se heat up atmosphere to a greater extent even without releasing CO2 during operation. If interested l can provide dozens of peer-reviewed trully scientific articles confirming the above statements. In the end every human being is a mini coal power plant. Through breathing we multiply CO2 concentration in the air by a factor of 100x. You are the carbon they want to reduce. The money wasted on fighting climate change by the means which only contribute to warming should be spent on meaningful adaptation and protection from adverse weather conditions
[11/23/22, 11:28:40 PM] Francois renet: this is really interesting1
[11/23/22, 11:33:42 PM] Dr. Denis: Climate data are heavily manipulated in order to fit political narrative. Most part of weather stations are located in urban areas affected by “heat island” effect. Of course with more traffic and buildings in the cities which all require cooling we heat up local atmosphere. Remote weather stations in rural areas indicate much less pronounced global warming trend. Small islands are doing fine, their surface is expanding according to satellite data. According to Prof William Happer at the current levels of CO2 & CH4 in the atmosphere even doubling-tripling won’t have much impact because their theoretical warming effect has been already saturated. It’s much more productive just to sit down and meditate rather than cry “Stop oil” and glue yourself to another oil-on-canvas painting in whatever museum with the glue made from oil 😎
[11/23/22, 11:48:30 PM] Dr. Denis: Good idea. I strongly recommend attending this event https://cryptosummit.ch/ l know the organisers for 6 years and they were always good. Most likely we’ll showcase there our phygital NFT project (digital artworks and copies of traditional masterpieces printed into anodized aluminum). There is already an NFT gallery at the same location at Zurich airport https://youtu.be/btYzEfB8g1o

That how our DAO’s pay it forward economic model functions 🙂🙏

[12/2/22, 8:19:54 AM] Gary Teh: Oh well… guess it’s really a later stage kind of solution when the network starts generating revenue stream 🤔

I was chatting with @16504369509 and did give this advice to a few folks who are looking to build up their projects in their early stage life cycles 

It is important to focus on attracting the missionaries versus the mercenaries 

Missionaries are folks who are happy to contribute some of their recreation time and idle resources to a project because the project’s mission and purpose resonates with their core values in exchange of a piece of ownership/voting rights in a project 

Mercenaries are just purely in there for the money and will be out of the picture as soon as funds run dry. 

Until there are some semblance of cash flow generated via project activities it is important to focus on attracting more missionaries to the project. They literally set the culture of the ecosystem that forms around the project. The culture provides the frame on how interactions with the mercenaries are structured at the later stage
‎[12/2/22, 8:25:39 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/2/22, 8:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/2/22, 8:30:03 AM] Gary Teh: So from a project management perspective, it is important to decipher between missionaries and mercenaries at the earlier stage

And ensure the mercenaries are not accidentally allocated to steps of the project that would block the task to be undertaken by the missionaries. 

Since until fiat money is available, mercenaries will not execute. And passionate missionaries hoping to execute will be blocked by mercenaries inaction for upstream task and start leaving due to frustration 

Now you see how the whole pay it forward economy works? It’s a fine balancing act 🤣
[12/2/22, 8:32:28 AM] Nelson ✨: Like the villagers and werewolves game? 😅
[12/2/22, 8:33:53 AM] Gary Teh: Precisely 🤩
[12/2/22, 8:34:13 AM] Nelson ✨: Maybe everyone is somehow alternating between being a missionary or a mercenary on a daily basis
[12/2/22, 8:34:35 AM] Nelson ✨: Let me ellaborate:

[12/2/22, 8:36:27 AM] Nelson ✨: I hope that makes sense xD - I’m jetlagged and with a strong cold xD
[12/2/22, 8:47:26 AM] Gary Teh: That is true too

That is another reason why this framework where there is a “space” deliberately defined and left there for anyone who so feels inspired to fill in the blank rather than having a specific task assigned to someone

That way anyone who so pleases for the day can contribute in their own way. This feels more like play (free will and total creativity) than work (not choice). 

Structuring the experience to feel like “work” without any “remuneration” only breeds resentment in the long run. It turns the culture toxic really fast. We accidentally stumbled upon this principle back in June and July when we were experimenting with implementing some variant of Olympus DAO tokenomics in our ecosystem. The culture started turning toxic really fast over a matter of weeks. It course corrected in dramatic fashion when we realized what was happening and purged the Olympus DAO tokenomic variant lock stock and barrel from our ecosystem 

In summary play is just play. zero expectations. The act of engaging in the activity itself is the reward.  🤩
‎[12/2/22, 8:47:31 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/2/22, 8:52:15 AM] Nelson ✨: I guess that people are more likely to engage in missionary activities when their survival needs are met (air, water, food, roof, love, health) - if these are not met, one might lean towards being the mercenary.

If the above are met, we can start looking a bit more for our desires :)
[12/2/22, 9:00:03 AM] Gary Teh: That is correct. It’s all a matter of free will! 🙂🙏

[12/2/22, 10:42:25 AM] Gary Teh: Chanced upon this truly inspirational video on Doing Nothing this morning 🤣

https://youtube.com/shorts/01TuxyG55ho?feature=share

It’s ironic how Karl Marx and the rest of his crew were fighting for labor rights and protection against employer exploitation (at the start of the industrial revolution) and fast forward to today humans are voluntarily giving up these rights all in the name of Career Advancement (aka getting ahead).

When you think of it critically the career ladder is an “artificial construct” built based on an underlying zero sum game principles utilizing  artificial scarcity (limited positions at the top of the pyramid), Powered by fear (asshole at the top shitting on you) and greed (desire to be adored by all the underling you are shitting on beneath you).   

Meanwhile unknowing human lab rats continue to sacrifice their health, time with family, time with friends and time for bucket list items all while accumulating pieces of paper that are inherently worthless and their subjective value inflated away by once again the folks occupying the very top of this artificial totem pole 🤣
[12/2/22, 11:37:55 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: I took a class in College on Marx.. it seems that the “alienization of the working classes” has already happened. It’s time to move onto a more uplifting system, don’t you think? I wonder what it could look like… 💗✌️

[12/2/22, 11:44:49 AM] Gary Teh: As you say all the time It will based around play! 

The Natives were just mainly chilling, doing artwork or “playing” by hunting for game once a week before the early European colonists came and introduced the notion of “land rights”

If you read through bulk of the historical data on European colonists conflict with the natives in various parts of the world during the age of exploration bulk of the contentions were around “land rights”

- Māoris in New Zealand 
- Aborigines in Australia
- Native Americans in the Americas 
- Ethnic tribes along the Straits Settlements (Modern day Southeast Asia) 

To natives this notion was just totally alien And foreign they saw themselves as stewards to the land and living on what the land gifted them. The idea of land owning and exploitation was only introduced into their psyche when they came into contact with early European colonists

[12/2/22, 2:39:01 PM] Dan: Really dig this a framework as a foundation. Our org has been 100% a missionary model since the start of Covid and definitely attracted a great community of people full of empathy, kindness, and creativity. 

We’ve created a large amount of impact with building emergency housing. The most so early on during Covid when many talented individuals were unemployed and wanted to give back. As people returned to work we’ve had challenges with being able to build as quickly as we had at the beginning due to people returning to work. Look forward to us developing revenue streams to allow individuals to dedicate more time to our cause while being able to help with their basic needs.
[12/2/22, 2:45:35 PM] Gary Teh: I foresee Cypher Defense and EcoVerse21 as two of those revenue stream 🤩
[12/2/22, 3:01:26 PM] Dan: That’s exciting! Look forward to the positive feedback loop. Definitely want to dive in and learn more about each of those projects as well 🌍

Most of them are mentally sound. All of them are mostly sitting around doing nothing all day long and just waiting for time to pass. 

Somehow they have managed to become totally irrelevant to society, more specifically the economy. 

You can call them the “useless” class 🤔
[12/5/22, 11:56:48 AM] Gary Teh: Coincidentally, being “useless” is a good thing from the DAOist perspective 🤣

A monk begs from lay believers by only offering  peace of mind 🤣

I never channel anything physical from myself since I have technically nothing to give except insights (which theoretically could be copy and pasted infinitely) 

instead I always channel abundance from the environment. Aka one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. 

The only difference required for this alchemy to happen is just insight. Aka telling a different story using the same set of props  🤣
[12/8/22, 2:19:35 PM] Gary Teh: Been reading this boomshae shared with me that she is going to self publish for proof reading purposes

The Prophecy of One

I remember me and Tiffine been chatting about something similar when we went and tripped out by the hot spring in the woods of Northern California
[12/8/22, 2:29:12 PM] Gary Teh: Actually this one once again a very self balancing mechanism 

When a patch of land gets too much sun, the solar panel starts collecting excess solar energy and that excess is then used to cool down the food supplies so that it stays fresh for longer 

Coincidentally since it’s the desert this means alot of wide open space without alot of people (where you could obtain food supplies) 

So the equation seems to balance itself out 🤩

[12/14/22, 5:03:24 PM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 I believe there might actually be a need to figure out how to setup a tokenized support system for folks
[12/14/22, 9:56:39 PM] Nick: this is very true @19514467219  the issues of loneliness v the supposed family stereotype are complicated as one can be lonely when with some people of the supposed family and yet far from home with close comrades you can feel more included than the stereotype 🙏
[12/14/22, 10:11:47 PM] Gary Teh: What I personally observed a few times is that if a lonely person realizes they have access to a non-judgemental listening ear, they will soak up all the attention they can get

A lot of the times what they end up doing is repeating the same content (traumatic episode) over and over again in a few hundred different ways. 

Their key need is not to convey the content but to receive the acknowledgment they are being heard by someone 

From my perspective, it really takes a lot of energy just to sit and give full attention

Unfortunately, I start feeling really drained after around two hours of such listening sessions and need to disengage from the activity 

Pass the hour mark it starts becoming strenuous to continue holding my attention on the person doing the speaking  

Tellur did mention it really felt therapeutic to have someone listen to him talk without in anyway attempting to disrupt his monologue while he is trying to talk his way through his thoughts 

It is actually not the first time someone used the word “therapeutic” to describe being on the receiving end of a compassionate listening ear. 

Hailey whom I was sitting with two nights ago around the campfire  literally talked herself to tears in front of me recounting her childhood trauma with her parents. 

Butterfly gypsy whom I was sitting beside at another campfire literally spun into this loop when taking herself through this deep anger she was feeling.
[12/14/22, 10:16:12 PM] Gary Teh: I observe some similarities in the cognitive pattern they exhibit as those I observed when I was going through the 10 day silent meditation retreat 

Once the mind is freed up from external stimulus and has spared attention left, what ends up happening is that it will try to heal itself of its past trauma by bringing those up for processing 

It is actually a symptom of a healthily functioning nervous system. 

So rather than avoid facing past demons, the primary practice is to bring up these demons and face them head on 

I wrote up a summary of my experiments into this area here on this blogpost 

https://garyteh.com/2018/01/summary-of-learnings-into-the-subject-of-mindfulness/
[12/14/22, 10:23:51 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the by product of being very deliberate with this cognitive calibration practice is that you start naturally certain category of actions which a mature adult human would naturally associate with the word “fear”

Coincidentally, I heard the word “fearless” being thrown around a few times during my discussion with various folks. 

From my perspective, when examining those common situations associated with fear, the probability of experiencing physical harm/fatality is technically zero. 

What is true though is that the body might end up potentially experiencing a lot of physical tension and the mind put in a generally “uncomfortable” situation. 

 A well calibrated system should be able to handle the situation without too much turbulence 🤔

[12/29/22, 12:27:06 AM] Anita Lamprecht: “People remain indispensable for value creation” … after reading the news about women in Afghanistan, soldiers in Ukraine and even the a list of famous people that have died… I think how we associate value to human life is the core problem. Working on strong AI that de-values human abilities is just another expression of the same problem.
[12/29/22, 12:33:59 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Great article by the way.
[12/29/22, 12:37:46 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, that is the problem. Seeing every human being as generic and replaceable instead of figuring how to augment the uniqueness of each unique soul
[12/29/22, 11:06:10 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Mycelium mushrooms used as self healing robot skin. Will robots be able to feel as well or is the skin just for a more human look?
https://switzerlandtimes.ch/lifestyle/researchers-create-self-healing-robotic-skin/
[12/29/22, 11:26:18 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it’s going to tricky to lock the mycelium in that phase of its life cycle where it continues to regenerate 

There is a threshold of food availability below which the mycelium switches from growth and regeneration model to reproduction model. That’s when the mushroom fruit body gets produced and the network slowly looses vitality and dies off 🤔
[12/29/22, 11:27:16 PM] Anita Lamprecht: The nutrition part is mentioned. You are spot on.

There seem to be so many side quests that surface themselves through NPCs that the main character could choose to part take in exchange for artifacts 

I will probably keep his offers as well as those from others in my log book. Will revert to checking out these side quests when I want some diversion from the main quest. 🤩

[12/29/22, 11:38:35 PM] Gary Teh: When I was experimenting with permaculture the way I would further extend the vitality of the plants so that they can continue producing more leaves for harvesting is to nip off the buds that would potentially flower as and when they arise 

And the way I would increase the size of the mushroom network is by continuously introducing more food to the network so that it keeps the maturity and reproductive phase at bay
[12/29/22, 11:40:11 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding human life span extension itself caloric restrictions to reduce metabolic levels is one of the secrets

[12/29/22, 11:55:08 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is the baseline condition of whether a person is an NPC is when you attempt to interact with the person you don’t get any response 

This is true both in terms of RPG world as well as in real life 🤣
[12/29/22, 11:56:17 PM] Anita Lamprecht: very true.
[12/29/22, 11:59:56 PM] Gary Teh: NPC can sometimes also turn into party members when stages are unlocked in a game 

So a NPC might not be a permanently remain NPC.

Likewise a party member might sometimes turn into an NPC after certain quest have been completed and the storyline has moved on
[12/30/22, 12:03:05 AM] Anita Lamprecht: but aren't humans then reduced to roles and purpose instead of persons with a soul? they would always remain NPC.

[12/30/22, 12:08:01 AM] Gary Teh: That is where the notion of quantum gets introduced 

You are simultaneously always both an NPC and a player. It just depends on which storyline you are looking at 

Then taking a step back borrowing from the notion of lens from literature. 

Seeing life as RPG is just but one of the many lens you can use to look at reality
[12/30/22, 12:09:21 AM] Gary Teh: Just because a person is examining reality through one lens doesnt mean other lens could not be used to examine  the same reality to yield a different perspective

[12/30/22, 12:13:33 AM] Gary Teh: The main challenge with attempting to examine reality through infinite lens is that 

1) our knowledge of all the available lens out there are just limited 

2) some lens are just to disturbing to look through 

3) we don’t have the luxury of time to examine the same reality through all the available lens before we are obliged to make a decision

[12/30/22, 12:25:58 AM] Gary Teh: Back to the analogy of the RPG, what is truly interesting from my perspective is how can such a real life RPG game be set up in such a way that main characters can eventually become NPCs as the storyline evolves while the game still continue in an interesting manner

A clear symptom that the RPG game framework still needs more work is that the term “founder” is still being randomly introduced into the storyline on and off

When I look at it objectively the character that is on occasion labeled “founder” really only holds 0.05% of all ever minted governance tokens. In the general scheme of things, this level of holdings is just a rounding error 🤔🤣

[12/30/22, 8:18:28 AM] Gary Teh: When you look through Frank Herbert’s Lens he used to write the book Dune, the Maudib the messiah is more a curse than a savior

Him wielding excessive influence served as a destabilizer than a balancer to the overall ecosystem 

Was it really a positive thing to destabilize the existing financial system within the world of Dune? 

Countless lives depended on that existing system for their livelihoods. 

Yes there were oppression of the nomads living on the desert planet. But did overthrowing the existing system for one created by the desert messiah lead to an overall better system for everyone across the entire galaxy. 

Actually not, when you look from the perspective of all the lives lost in the process of Maudib’s jihadic scourge across the entire galaxy. 

It’s a very elaborate presentation of the age old philosophical problem, a car is out of control on the road the brakes are not working. 

We have came to a fork in the road. 

There is a water barrier which the car can safely crash into the driver takes a right turn. However there are a bunch of civilians in the way, they will get killed 

There is a cliff drop off if the driver turns left because the road is incomplete. The 5 civilians will get to stay alive. But for sure the driver will definitely die

Given only these two options what is the right action to take?

[5/13/23, 3:20:09 PM] Gary Teh: The classical Question: imagine a world where everything and anything has been automated by robotics and AI, and the only thing that any man needs to do is nothing, what is the reason for this generally purposeless and pointless existence. Why not put a gun to your head and end it?  


Every time I throw out this question to someone random whom I happen to meet and engage in a random conversation with at some random event in some random parts of the world, I would a get totally drastically different answer. I am always totally surprised by it. 


One says the continued witness of love and beauty in our world is reason enough for continued existence 

A second says it’s defiling of one’s divinity to do that

The third from two days ago mentioned she would grow such a huge garden filled with love and have party with her friends everyday

While the DAO just vote on the high level parameters 

The entire trading network should just be automated 

I was thinking of doing something like this back in 2006 when I was running an eBay power seller account out of Singapore when that network started 

Feels like it might be time to finally do so via EcoVerse

[6/13/23, 6:35:45 AM] Gary Teh: @14152023011 shared about how to become nothing in this wonderful blog post he wrote 

https://davidhu.substack.com/p/becoming-nothing

We had a really wonderful discussion yesterday here in Florianopolis about how when one’s action is aligned with Divinity, the Divine Will will flow through the Conduit (he who surrendered fully to the Divine) and the Divine Fire manifest on earthly realms via the second and third order impact from earthly actions of the Conduit 🔥
[6/13/23, 6:47:59 AM] Gary Teh: One of the key insights from the chat we had last night was that we are already Free. It’s the fixation that we have been caught in by one mental construct or another that cause us to become imprisoned. 

The “fear of death” is the greatest prison, forcing us into the adoption of one narrative (mental construct) or another in order to find “escape”. 

Death is a very natural stage of the life process. Once we can fully embrace this stage of the life process and fully let go of the fear, then a lot of the additional energy that was otherwise locked up due to this mental fixation can be freed up and reallocated elsewhere. 

Based on what I observed during the past three years of “the Being Nothing” experiment, I observe that the actual level of energy required to stay alive is actually much lesser than commandeered by the “fear of death” 🤔

And so grateful to meet everyone and connect ..... and just like Gary said, as I surrender to the divine will, I let my "I" go away and what wants to come through to come through ... and have since found myself starting a crypto hedge fund at the eco villages mentioned in the post above, creating a community of conscious Asians, hosting retreats, travelling, and continuing the work of unravelling layer after layer of old identities, shedding them like the skins of a snake ...

Much love from Brazil!

[6/13/23, 6:36:10 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished reading the book you recommended “The Surrender Experiment”

Coincidentally it is by the same author that wrote the “untethered soul”

That book was recommended to me by an ex-colleague whom also went for the 10 day silent meditation retreat the same time I did. 

She past away back in 2019 two weeks after our reunion dinner due to cancer. 

Her death deeply shocked and inspired me to drop most of the stuff on my plate to go visit all the friends I haven’t meet seen for more than a decade in Asia just months before COViD happened. 

You could almost think of her as what triggered my “be nothing” experiment which spanned across the entire pandemic

While Reading this book I had a feeling she was conveying the message me that she is fine and well in her after life
[6/13/23, 6:39:51 PM] Gary Teh: This experience with the book felt very similar to another experience I had during the beginning of this year with another book I was reading on another plane at the tail end of my “be nothing” experiment 

Another very close colleague of mine past away for health reasons the day the temple burned during burning man last year. 

When I was reading that other book, I had the strong sense that this other colleague was also conveying she was doing fine and well in her after life.

[6/24/23, 11:04:39 AM] David Hu - Crupto Hedge Fund : The thing I’m most interesting in is how to truly “do nothing” in a way in which you’re not actually “doing” nothing — because then you’re still doing something — you’re suppressing an impulse to do. When you’re truly doing nothing, you still breathe eat walk etc but it comes from the Tao. So I’ve been on this continuous exploration of how to get closer and closer to the true Tao. Still just a beginner but this is one of my deepest curiosities

This is quite true. Bulk of the copywriting efforts for our whitepaper has already been redirected to ChatGpt

[8/28/23, 11:35:15 PM] Gary Teh: This afternoon I had a moment of epiphany while driving down along the coast. 

If you had an idea how the world has changed 300 days after that hitman has put a bullet in your head, how will you live the remaining 300 days of your life? 

If the cashier at the cafe whom I paid 4USD for my cup of coffee last year no longer exist six months ago, I probably wouldn’t even think about it when I wake up. 

But I doubt her five year old daughter (if she has one) would probably feel the same way I do tomorrow morning when she wakes up if her mum past away 300 days ago. The kid will still probably be grieving or grow up with some form of latent trauma as an adult many years from now 🤔

[9/22/23, 6:07:53 PM] Gary Teh: This autumn equinox is turning out to be quite surreal

Traffic yesterday was crazy. Even saw a kid getting knocked into on a bike by a huge truck on the street. And a metal plate almost falling on us while we were driving 

Thereafter was the cacao ceremony yesterday in Itacaré northern Brazil 

Next was my mum’s knee operation while I was asleep at night 

Thereafter was me awoken to the scream of a woman with a scalpel held to her throat in my dream 

Then was me quickly realizing some clog pores had popped releasing a huge amount of blood drenching my right ear when I looked in the mirror after waking up from that crazy scream 

Tomorrow I will be attending my second cacao ceremony with Barbara before booting out half the folks from our @120363111951279022@g.us based on the new set of rules everyone has voted into effect 

Seems like a lot of cutting and clashing is going on 🤣

The three days 七杀seven killings is ruling heaven and earth

[9/26/23, 4:56:49 AM] Gary Teh: *The hypothesis*
identity is like a chair that a person sits on. 

If you forcefully yanked off one of the foot from the chair (person’s identity), the person will feel destabilized and experience the natural impulse to want to stablize his chair (identity) again. 

When this natural impulse arises, kinetic energy becomes readily available for harness.

I'll be more than happy if you ruin my fun by doing meaningful things that create real benefit for people
[9/27/23, 12:08:03 AM] Gary Teh: Meaning doesn’t exist as an independent objective phenomena

Examined critically it is just a figment of imagination in your random stream of consciousness. 

We should just devote our time to nothing meaningful while we have some fun because that is the only thing that we could objectively attempt at 🤩

*soul badges* naturally enhance or diminish a DAO members voting weightage on specific category of DAO policies

[10/22/23, 10:13:55 AM] Gary Teh: I think the antithetical approach to that described by Jensen (CEO of Nvidia) would be to figure out a way to spread the load and benefit of any endeavor as far and wide to as many people as possible 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benjamingilbert_the-most-shocking-thing-from-talking-with-activity-7120815880887799808-NbQu

It just occurred to me a split second ago… in our post industrialized world, the accepted norm to raising children and build ventures just lacks *common sense* 

The entire load of raising the child falls squarely on the shoulder of the father and the mother (the nuclear family unit)

The entire load of building a venture falls squarely on the shoulder on a small set of cofounders initially

[11/5/23, 12:50:10 AM] Gary Teh: I had a lot of folks at the Hacker Dojo coming up to me asking about how to get their own DAO concept working after presenting some of the psychological frameworks we have tested and proved to work within this abridged keynote presentation at the Lightning Talks yesterday evening

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YV5l8hhA9BrjOH4HcMHC6VSxNhlaLpDuTnWP0LlFimg/edit#slide=id.g296f588c569_0_200

A lot of them were surprised that there was still a DAO that is still persistently surviving like a *cockroach*  in this crypto winter (aka Ice Age) when a lot of the other larger players (dinosaurs) in the web3 space have already thrown in the towel on Web3 ideals and instead opted to hop on to the AI bandwagon.

One of them is a very well funded L1 chain and was trying to get their DAO up and running to fund projects, but they couldn't seem to get meaningful projects surface within their ecosystem. However much they tried.

[11/6/23, 3:30:04 PM] Gary Teh: An insight that became apparent about our DAO model after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount coordinating within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

The recurring observed when getting DAO members involved in the latter category of actions just seem to yield visible levels of frustrations. 🤔

From this perspective the more we can Do Nothing of the latter category of actions and design our experience around the former category of actions the better we can leverage on the strengths of our DAO model. 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/25/23, 3:45:10 PM] Gary Teh: Ahah! I received the answer to this mind boggling paradox in the _*Heart Sutra*_ even before my private session with the monk instructor

The word *_emptiness*_ was misleading also the text when misinterpreted leads to *_nihilism*_

The more suitable word is *_empty space*_ as opposed to *_emptiness*_

It describes the third level of *_mindfulness meditation practice*_ 

Level 1: focused unwavering attention on a single point (your breathe) 

Level 2: open monitoring of the entire environment 

Level 3: observation of the *_awareness*_ that is monitoring what is going on in the environment. 🤯 ‎<This message was edited>

While the avatar in this holographic universe is going through all the *_trials and tribulations*_ in samsara (_six realms / holographic universe / earthly realms_), this *_choiceless awareness* Do Nothing_

In Zen they call this *_choiceless awareness*_ _your Original Face before you were born_

All my words as well as the words written in the various sutra are just like _the finger pointing at the moon_. 

Every avatar has to go *find the moon themselves* to understand the real meaning beyond the words 🤩🙏

[12/13/23, 9:26:14 PM] Gary Teh: Prior to my departure from London she brought me to a spiritualist church where mediums channeled the spirits

The medium of the day there came up to me after service was over and said he saw a spirit of a monk smiling at me the whole time. 

The monk in his vision had a golden thread in his hands with one knot missing and was pointing at me the whole time 🤔

The medium interpreted it as the *_journey to the west*_ was not done yet, I was supposed to go even further westwards!?! 🤯

He even mentioned he even had the vision of the statue liberty somewhere in there 🤔

I was quietly thinking to myself “_Yeah dude nice try. I am too f**king broke now, I am headed back to Singapore to go try make some cash in the middle of the financial crisis… Forget about the West!!!_”

In hindsight his mention of the missing knot made total sense. 

The contents of the book given to me by the Sufi mystic made sense. The only problem was trying to figure how to turn theory into execution. 

It was like someone gave you a very well written documentation on how to use a software library but forgot to give you the actual software library to write your code 🤦‍♂️

I only finally started slowly figuring out what the actual software library was on 8 years later (2016) when I was at the very very western end of the Northern American continent in the Bay Area… in the words of the medium “_very very far west”_ 🤔🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/13/23, 9:38:43 PM] Brian -IOM: "Tuesday’s sighting is not the first time a whale has been spotted in the Thames. In January 2006, a northern bottlenose whale caused a splash after being spotted by a man on a train. Within moments of the sighting, crowds gathered along London’s Battersea Bridge to catch a glimpse of the whale. According to Dolman, bottlenose whales (unlike belugas) are usually found in deep waters, so the whale of 2006 found itself in trouble – fast. Despite the best efforts of rescuers, the 18-foot whale died as those in the water rallied to save it."

[12/13/23, 10:05:23 PM] Gary Teh: I was roaring with even more laughter when the monk recounted the story of Siddartha last Sunday

The way the monk described it, the dude from 2500 years ago was just obsessed. 

Somewhere along the way, he had this idea in his head and he systematically exhausted every single possible practice he could lay his hands on out there to verify the effectiveness of each. 

It is totally a mental trait I could totally relate with given all the random experiments I get really really obsessed with along the way. 

Despite his obsessiveness for what he was doing, he was very relatable as a person. I guess that is probably why his Story and the underlying WHY still reasonates with the some many people after 2500 years 

When we read his story some, it just somehow reminds us of some aspects of ourselves. 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

But most of all I have been playing with Ai photography on Midjourney and am close to publishing a new website called "the ai photographer" - gearing up to sell work both as (old school) physical silver gelatin black and white prints and an NFT collection! One of the projects is called "The Road To Nowhere", which is like a reverse Rorschach test for Ai - asking it to describe (funnily enough) "nothing". The results are mind blowing!

Share your most recent experience where you got mentally fixated on doing something even though you know deep down that doing it was absolutely pointless

And also if you are open to it, share what lead you to this fixation in the first place

And finally if you are really really open, what were the physical sensations you felt in your body as you experienced your fixation 🙂🙏

Before Davos was known to be the venue for the world economic forum, it has been a place where seers, mystics and healers gathered due to the energetic aspects of its location 

It is starting to make sense I just kept getting invited back year after year for workshops that has absolutely nothing to do with the world economy during the week of the World Economic Forum . 🤣

[1/19/24, 8:08:49 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 the day before at the Free Thinker Society in Davos where he and I shared about the concerns of the forthcoming @120363044542957540@g.us 

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect which surfaced during further discussion: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion at the forum taking place in Davos. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

[1/20/24, 3:22:09 AM] Gary Teh: _Do Nothing_ seems to be a prevalent theme amongst friends I have spent time with here in Davos this week. 

_Do nothing happens on multiple levels:_

- it is considered faux pas to not _Do Nothing_  before trust is established within circle of friends in the Davos community. This is especially true amongst friends who have achieved a high level of mastery at _Do Nothing_

- ⁠Circular Economy is considered a deep _Do Nothing_ practice. As nothing is left behind after engineering redesign is completed 

- ⁠True Do Nothing is not different from performing Seva

- ⁠The most successful stewards of resources appear as though they are permanently engaged in _Do Nothing_

Interesting reading for folks keep to further explore Do Nothing

[1/22/24, 11:52:42 PM] ~ Rich Lang: Amazing quote. I shared a Will Durant quote at one of the Free Thinker’s Society panels at Davos where the convo seemed to be turning toward fear of the dystopian…

“Civilization is a stream with banks. The stream is sometimes filled with blood from people killing, stealing, shouting and doing the things historians usually record, while on the banks, unnoticed, people build homes, make love, raise children, sing songs, write poetry and even whittle statues. The story of civilization is the story of what happened on the banks. Historians are pessimists because they ignore the banks for the river.”

One of the scene (_dude pointing a rifle at MJ_) reminded of the dude that tried to offer me a knife while in Salvador, Brazil near where MJ did his MTV 🤔

_PS: perhaps the spirit of MJ has been watching over us after all given that the dude with the knife did not do anything more than show me his knife before walking away that evening 🤯_

_at this point, I was also reminded of the time when over in São Paulo at Fatima place where she started singing MJ’s “We are the world” after understanding the motivation for all these Do Nothing activities we are engaged in 🤣_ ‎<This message was edited>

_PS: By the way, I lite the sandal wood you gifted today while I was in my car. It’s so balanced compared the other one I bought. I didn’t at all feel overpowered by the fumes_

[2/2/24, 10:11:17 AM] Bhavana: But intellectually, you can get some idea about the spiritual level, depending on how you feel (your state), for example,
like how much you feel that you do nothing (since this is the do nothing society is :)
The chart about it in this article may help in that regard.

[2/5/24, 2:15:05 AM] Vlatko Gigov: In the series “Discussions between a human and AI”: the AI lays out the differences between “Self-Realization”, “Self-Actualization” and “Self-Transcendence”

Self-Realization:

Focus: Self-realization involves becoming aware of and understanding one's true nature, values, and identity. It is a process of discovering and aligning with one's authentic self.

Key Aspects: It often involves introspection, self-awareness, and the recognition of personal values, beliefs, and purpose in life. Self-realization is about gaining insights into one's character and striving for a more authentic and fulfilling life.

Self-Actualization:

Focus: Self-actualization, a concept introduced by Abraham Maslow, pertains to realizing and fulfilling one's unique potential, talents, and capabilities. It is associated with the pursuit of personal growth, meaningful achievements, and the expression of one's creativity.

Key Aspects: Self-actualization involves the realization of personal goals, the development of creativity, and the continuous striving for personal excellence. It is often considered the pinnacle of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

Self-Transcendence:

Focus: Self-transcendence goes beyond the individual self and involves a connection to something greater than oneself. It is about transcending personal concerns and finding meaning and purpose in contributing to the well-being of others or a larger whole.

Key Aspects: This concept, introduced by Viktor Frankl and further explored by others, emphasizes the importance of altruism, spirituality, and the pursuit of goals that extend beyond personal gratification. It involves a sense of interconnectedness with others and the universe.

In summary, while self-realization is about understanding one's authentic self, self-actualization involves realizing personal potential, and self-transcendence extends beyond the self to connect with something larger, whether it's others, a cause, or a spiritual dimension. Together, these concepts represent a holistic view of personal and spiritual development.
[2/5/24, 2:16:37 AM] Vlatko Gigov: would be great to get more insights from this group on @14153000019’s question about frameworks for “mental health betterment” and “spiritual mastery” considering the modern day’s pressure points.

[2/5/24, 7:43:51 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Fascinating. But don’t we as conscious beings have the choice of detaching! I challenge the notion that urbanisation is the route cause of mental suffering. Maybe late stage capitalism deems it to be and the zero sum game you mention, but it’s urban centres where we’ve geometrically progressed in innovation across verticals. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/5/24, 7:51:51 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Indeed. But what of clusters (populous) left in urban areas beyond that point of no return? Can one detach and still live in the urban mayhem?

[2/5/24, 8:48:52 PM] Gary Teh: What she describes in this video reminds me of this other clip by Bruce Lee that @41799155602 privately shared on the same day

*_During the Second wave of ascension*_, the video states the warrior spirit awakens and the desire to fight against injustice in the environment arises. Bruce Lee was doing a lot of that when he was in Hollywood fighting against racial discrimination 

*_During the first wave of ascension*_ the video states a sentient being can simply switch reality for the collective experience. Quite similar to what Bruce Lee stated in between the lines in the video below… highest technique as having No Technique… and there exist no opponents because the I doesn’t exist 🤣

These guys were obviously doing nothing yet they stumbled upon the Fermi Paradox. Who cares!

Point being: the mainstream is relativising and making outlier ideas comfortable to be grasped by the general populous! It’s fascinating to see this shift in mainstream narrative. Question: would this be a natural shift in narrative or out of despair?
[2/8/24, 12:29:28 AM] Bhavana: Sadhana or spiritual practice (subconscious level techniques like self hypnotherapy and chanting meditation) helped me to overcome subconscious tendencies like expectations from things, situations, people, self and in my case, even the spiritual master and higher self :)
[2/8/24, 12:46:10 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The synchronicity or should I say singularity to be more precise in things manifest.

*_The gist of it:*_
When you deeply Love the World and all Beings (_Agape_), the natural impulse is to actively seek to heal the world by tackling its problems (_satseva_), resources will naturally flow your way (_stewardship_) to support you in your endeavor (_because the world will trust and love you back_)! 🤩🙏

[2/9/24, 7:23:04 AM] Gary Teh: Attending *_VanAid*_ over the next few days. 

It’s the final of the many decentralized/unorganized gatherings out here in the desert during the winter season. 

In this specific gathering, as a form of *communal well wishing* (_seva_), nomads offer help to others who might need some parts of their rigs fixed before everyone finally scatters from the desert and go their own ways for the rest of the year. 😢

Jamie who is one of the facilitators shared the 2 pager rules for VanAid. 

The gist of it is

- Needers should have *_zero expectations_*

- ⁠Volunteer helpers should feel *_zero obligation_* and only aid if they strongly feel they want to offer help

- Needers should clearly frame the *_WHY*_, their needs and make available / pre-acquire the necessary materials for the fix required


_PS: Do Nothing in this case means to resist the urge to be a dictator… because even if you want to you really have no control over the universe… surface the empty frame and just observe it… exercise gratitude if and when anything arises in this Emptiness 🤩🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

[2/12/24, 10:33:44 AM] Sangye. Yanling Duan: Do nothing means, do nothing agains the law of nature…WUWEI meangs "Holding Zero and Keeping One, Zero-One Mindfulness practice" is a fundational practice to understand Daoist practiioners approch. 


The law of zero:
1, Dont  allow the heart to hold unkind thoughts

2, Do not force yourself to do what you do not want to do. Do not intentionally or unintentionally induce to guide and force others to do what they do not want to do.

3. Do not desire for what you don't need: don't intend too much on what you don't need. Do not covet what others have or  what you do not have.

4. Donot invest in energy in things you do not bother or  that cannot be changed. 

5, Do not  waste mental energy at all if you do not feel commitment and want to put things into action.

6, Do not make statement without thourough research, and speed half-boiled noise as understanding and making statement out of emotion.

7 Do not keep outdated emotional baggage and material things in your envirment without beauty, funcion, meaning. 


The Law of One:
1, lower self: hold Kind thoughts
2. true selfl: be present 
3. higher sefl: strive for Unity

[2/13/24, 5:00:52 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002  What is the Yin approach to doing nothing? Please respond in concise bullet points
[2/13/24, 5:00:55 AM] Meta AI: The Yin approach to doing nothing involves:

• Embracing stillness and quietness
• Allowing things to unfold naturally
• Non-action (wu wei) and non-interference
• Receptivity and openness
• Letting go of control and expectations
• Trusting in the natural order and timing
• Focusing on being rather than doing

This approach values patience, surrender, and harmony with the natural flow of life. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/13/24, 1:00:39 PM] Nandarani Meister: some more...: God had brought me to my knees and made me acknowledge my own nothingness, and out of that knowledge I had been reborn. I was no longer the centre of my life and therefore I could see God in everything.

[2/13/24, 1:01:20 PM] Nandarani Meister: Feeling so inspired reading this: There is a beautiful expression of this in the Chandogya Upanishad: 'There is this City of Brahman, (that is the body), and in this city there is a shrine, and in that shrine there is a small lotus, and in that lotus there is a small space, (akasa). Now what exists within that small space, that is to be sought, that is to be understood.' This is the great discovery of the Upanishads, this inner shrine, this guha, or cave of the heart, where the inner meaning of life, of all human existence, is to be found.
[2/13/24, 1:02:55 PM] Nandarani Meister: Let's move forward on that great quest of human existence together through expressing our love through service🔥💚🔥

[2/14/24, 6:38:44 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 help explain Bruce Lee’s saying of having no technique and no opponents because “I” don’t exist ‎<This message was edited>
[2/14/24, 6:38:47 AM] Meta AI: Ah, a profound concept! Bruce Lee's philosophy suggests that when we let go of ego and preconceived notions, we can transcend limitations and connect with the present moment. The idea of "no technique" means not being bound by rigid forms or styles, but rather flowing like water. Similarly, having "no opponent" implies that there is no separation between self and other, and that we are all interconnected. The phrase "I don't exist" points to the dissolution of the ego, allowing us to tap into a more universal awareness. It's a beautiful reminder to approach life with fluidity, humility, and a sense of oneness! ‎<This message was edited>
[2/14/24, 6:56:18 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The I exists only nowhere! 🖼️ or in the party 😁 as Orwell famously scribbled in 1984: “Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.”

Just reading this whitepaper for the *_Do Nothing society*_ brother 

It is so well written and multifaceted in how it makes Do Nothing relevant to different aspects of society! 

What do you propose are the next steps to *_Do Nothing Day*_? 🤩🙏
[2/15/24, 9:01:47 AM] Jinn - The Man Who Wrote Shine: Well, thanks. I would be happy to invite co-creators who can contribute somehow.

For me. It will be to polish the document, prioritise the items and then do some plannings around a launch date (with communications, website, PR, and collect the outputs from a small group on how they spent their day and feedback into the greater process)
[2/15/24, 9:02:55 AM] Jinn - The Man Who Wrote Shine: It’s more révélant today then ever… and the download was stronger as I was writing it but I wanted a first short draft and most people dislike reading these days

“OpenAI has released its new text to video AI called Sora. While this may seem like a remarkable feat, it also poses a massive danger. The days of massive disinformation are here, and we will undoubtedly see countless deepfakes polluting social media and news in the future as this technology continues to improve. 

As a society, we need to avoid rushing into this post-truth era. 

To address this issue, we need regulation to at least force the authors of such videos to add a note indicating that they were generated artificially. Education is also crucial; we need to teach people to critically approach sensationalist news. Additionally, technology needs to evolve. We need automated deepfake detection tools to be deployed on as many platforms as possible to detect and prevent the spread of deepfakes.”

[2/20/24, 11:32:57 PM] Gary Teh: This principle surfaced during during our one on one product management check in today with Anupa. It’s basically the same principle that Franck surfaced to @41799155602  two years ago during another separate conversation 

Business models are basically a set of assumptions (_logical equations_) of how the world works 

any model will collapse as soon as one logical equation within the entire model is FALSE and not TRUE. 

Larger and more complicated models are inherently more fragile than simpler ones. And also takes way more to time and resources to validate

[2/25/24, 10:31:24 AM] Vlatko Gigov: “ Here’s where the science gets really ugly. The more addicts rely on these stimuli, the less pleasure they receive. At a certain point, this cycle creates anhedonia—the complete absence of enjoyment in an experience supposedly pursued for pleasure.

That seems like a paradox.

How can pursuing pleasure lead to less pleasure? But that’s how our brains are wired (perhaps as a protective mechanism). At a certain point, addicts still pursue the stimulus, but more to avoid the pain of dopamine deprivation.

People addicted to painkillers have the same experience. Beyond a certain level, opioid dependence actually makes the pain worse.

What happens when this same experience is delivered to everybody, via their phones? The results are devastating, as expert Dr. Len Lantz explains. Even people who thought they were immune to addictive behavior, get destroyed by the cycle:

There is a specific, abnormal brain activation pattern that is present in people who have anhedonia, which is a key feature of major depression, and absent in those who do not. It is often the case that when patients come to me with major depression, they say, “I shouldn’t be depressed. I have a good life. If my friends or coworkers knew I was depressed, they wouldn’t understand or they would be mad at me. They think I have it made. So, why don’t I feel that way?”

We’re now seeing the first effects on a grand social scale of this deadening effect.

Sure, let’s give it a name, something like TikTok depression or Silicon Valley zombification or whatever. The key fact is that users can feel it, even if they don’t have a label or a diagnosis. They feel it even if the technocrats refuse to tell them about it. Just listen to the words people use to describe their toxic online interactions: doomscrolling, trolling, doxxing, gaslighting, etc.

In the year 2024, this is what we do for fun.

But it doesn’t bring happiness. The World Happiness Report surveyed 150,000 people in 26 countries, and found that the US and other prosperous, technologically advanced societies are suffering a massive happiness decline. This is what happens when anhedonia is on sale every week—and the pervasive tech platforms increasingly resemble the ruthless corporations that got rich from opioid abuse. “
[2/25/24, 10:35:00 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Would be great to spark a debate on the above excerpt from the article. What would be the anti measures one and communities could take to combat this progressive rise in anhedonia?

This is where all the USA military testing activites are taking place 

Past few weeks in the desert while Doing Nothing out in the middle of nowhere, I managed to observe 

- chinook helicopters making tactical maneuvers 

- ⁠testing of cluster bombs on the chocolate mountains 

- ⁠high velocity automated guns

- ⁠the blue angels airplane formation training 

- ⁠new fighter pilot training maneuvers 

_PS: not surprised why half the folks I ended up camping with are generally mid to high ranking ex-military. This is desert area is where they are usually stationed while back in the USA doing nothing._

[3/1/24, 6:14:33 PM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 could you elaborate on what it mean to be a Nobody Doing Nothing in the Middle of Nowhere and how it relates to the mantra _”Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi svaha!”_
[3/1/24, 6:14:35 PM] Meta AI: The concept of being a "Nobody Doing Nothing in the Middle of Nowhere" is a philosophical and spiritual idea that suggests letting go of attachments to identity, action, and location. It means embracing the present moment, free from the constraints of ego and external expectations. It's about finding freedom in the absence of labels and definitions.

This idea relates to the mantra "Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi svaha!" which is a Buddhist chant that translates to "Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone beyond beyond, enlightenment, hail!" This mantra symbolizes the journey of spiritual awakening, where one transcends the limitations of the self and reaches a state of ultimate understanding.

In this context, being a Nobody Doing Nothing in the Middle of Nowhere represents the ultimate goal of this spiritual journey: to let go of all attachments and become one with the universe, achieving a state of profound wisdom and liberation. By embracing this mantra and concept, one can cultivate a sense of inner peace, freedom, and unity with all things. ‎<This message was edited>

*speculative take aways*
Nothing needs to be done regarding climate change issue. Human population level will head towards a downwards spiral as urban centers around the world become unfavorably overpopulated and inhabitants gear themselves for immortality instead of reproduction

[3/8/24, 9:25:15 AM] Gary Teh: Started implementing _*Disagree and Commit_* protocol when interfacing with other DAO members within the scope of guild activities I am involved with

This protocol is aligned with our core values of *_Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity_*

*How it works*
- person who is in charge of a specific scope within a guild has full *_Autonomy_* within that scope in making decisions

- ⁠other DAO members can propose ideas for adoption (_*Diversity_*), however proposal needs to be backed by qualitative or quantitative data (_*Integrity_*). 

- ⁠adoption of proposal is subjected to the discretion of person in charge of scope (_*Autonomy*_) 

_PS: It’s been observed opinions (statements not backed by any form of data or logical reasoning) has a significantly lower acceptance rate and has a longer lag time than well researched proposals_

_historically within this DAO, opinions are converted into data through our polling process 🙂🙏_

It’s been observed they meander endlessly without clearly articulating what they are trying to achieve

It’s further observed they had to be prompted with the same set of basic questions to clean up their communication 
 
- what is your product?
- who is the customer that uses it?
- what is the benefit to customers? 
- how do you make a profit? 
- how is your product different from what is already out there?
- ⁠what has recently changed in the larger environment that has created a market gap for this differentiated product of yours to finally become feasible? ‎<This message was edited>

Josh (_featured in the video abov_) is officially certified by the medical doctor as mentally disabled. The state provides him with USD450 per month for his personal needs. If and when he ever holds a job and gets paid for it, he will lose his disabilities pension

It’s observed with the exception of electronics, every other area of his life is in total shambles. He falls squarely in _Savant_ category 

He mentions he would love to make more cash and have a family. Right now it is almost impossible for two reasons, his earnings ability and his mental impairment 

One possible way to help him get around the disability impediment imposed by the state is if he receives cryptocurrencies as _donations_ ‎<This message was edited>

There are only two other folks left in that cluster 

Josh who has also been officially certified by the USA doctors to be mentally disabled. However he is a total genius when it comes to hardware and electronics like solar panels, batteries and RV parts

Adam has been exhibiting some pretty severe personality disorder ever since discharging from the hospital due to being knocked down by a car out in the desert three months ago. The concept of private space and boundaries doesn’t seem to register in his brain anymore. This problem has gotten him a series of eviction notices by the wardens of this BLM land. Strangely seems everytime they come by to attempt at evicting him off the land he is nowhere to be found. 

The gathering of this eclectic group seems a setting for a great story of one sort or another. 🤔

[4/4/24, 8:00:43 PM] Gary Teh: And then the universe finally decides to align my car too. 💣

After 3 hours of rattling, coupled with the usually heavy vibration across the entire car structure and steering wheel misalignment as well as the occasional sideway drifting, this replacement tire I got last month blew up too while I was on the freeway driving at 80 miles per hour… 

I think the drivers of the car beside as well as the truck behind got totally stunted by the dramatic blow up while I looked out of the car puzzled at the black thing that flew into the air trying to figure out what actually happened 🤔

Sometime later, I was standing over the spare tire with the mechanic who came to help get the tires swapped. 

the spare tire was so old it dry rotted as well. The both of us were calculating the odds of me getting the car to the nearest Walmart auto center to get a replacement on this dry rotted spare tire before it too blows up. 

He had this somewhat concerned look on his face after we calculated the odds. 😱

I figured, I should just bite the bullet and bet on the odds panning favorable. But if reincarnation should happen at this point it has been a wonderful existence in this physical body 🤩🤞🍀

What became immediately apparent upon driving this car for the first time ever using the spare tire was the severe alignment issue I have been experiencing at the steer wheel ever since owning the car totally evaporated 🤯🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[4/7/24, 8:25:47 AM] Gary Teh: Been recently experimenting with this methodology shared by @17032098028 

*Observations*

_insight 1_
Darwinian theory posits an organism thrives when it is able to extract more calories than it expense when operating in an environment

_Insight 2_
Historical imprinting in the nervous system and the neural network has lead to scenarios where categories of environmental triggers result in cascading chains of physical sensations, impulses, thought patterns and physical actions

_insight 3_
Historical imprinting in our nervous system and neural network might be from an environment that no longer exist. Hence, imprinting might be outdated and caloric inefficient

_insight 4_
It is possible to identify the various chain effects running through the body mind system by paying deliberate attention

_insight 5_
One can apply the methodology to modify the thought patterns and physical actions 

_insight 6_
Or one can go even further by applying Vipassana to deeply penetrate into each and every chain effect and go beyond the point of trigger to identify the artifacts sitting in the memory banks associated with the trigger. 

There is usually some energetically charged artifacts sitting in the memory bank waiting to be discharged 

_insight 7_
Practice of loving kindness compassion while thoroughly exploring the artifact sitting in the memory bank will serve to discharge it of its energetic qualities. An artifact once fully discharged often has the effect of neutralizing its corresponding triggers and their chain effects

*conclusion*
Updated triggers and chain effects are removed from the mind-body system, Mind-body system becomes caloric optimal for the environment it’s operating in. ‎<This message was edited>

_The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested_
[4/8/24, 6:03:26 AM] Gary Teh: PS: Reminds me of the verses in the Heart Sutra

_Form does not differ from emptiness, emptiness does not differ from form…_

_All dharmas (natural order of the universe) are marked by emptiness, neither arise nor cease, need a defiled nor pure, neither increase nor decrease…_

The verses seem to be describing the *_law of conservation of energy*_ which seems to be a recurring theme amongst literature on Eastern spirituality. 

From a physics standpoint, our cosmic universe (_the entirety of existence_) is a self enclosed energy system. 

Total energy level remains constant in this self enclosed energy system (_entirety of existence_) regardless of the physical form the energy chooses to manifest itself

From a logic standpoint, unless it can be proven an entity can exist independently outside of the total field of existence, it is quite hard to negate the above statement ‎<This message was edited>
[4/8/24, 6:26:06 AM] Gary Teh: One might then ask how did this energy constant come about in the fast place 

That’s is where one hits the wall. 

The only conclusion that could be drawn thus far is that for whatever reason, it’s just there. 

If it makes you feel better about this inexplicable anomaly, feel free to apply whatever label you are accustomed to, God, Krishna, Consciousness, Emptiness or Allah…

[4/9/24, 10:55:53 AM] Victor Pineda: Building on the insights from your study session and the abbot's instructions, we can delve deeper into understanding the nature of the soul and consciousness:

Just as the abbot in the San Francisco area zen monastery illuminated, recognizing our consciousness is pivotal to understanding our essence beyond physical or social identities. This consciousness, undisturbed by the transient states of the body or mind, offers a gateway to profound self-realization. 

It invites us to consider:How do our daily activities and interactions either cloud or clarify this intrinsic awareness?

In moments of quiet reflection or meditation, can we discern this continuous thread of consciousness, unbroken by sleep or disturbance, as the very foundation of our being?

Reflecting on the eternal nature of the soul, how does this perspective transform our understanding of life, death, and the impermanent world around us?

By contemplating these questions and engaging in practices that enhance our awareness of the soul's eternal consciousness, we embark on a journey toward uncovering our true nature. 

This process, often highlighted in various spiritual traditions, not only deepens our connection with ourselves but also with the world around us, revealing the interconnectedness of all life.

The journey inward, guided by the timeless wisdom shared by spiritual teachers like Bhavana (and others here), becomes not just an exploration of our inner landscape but a path to liberation from the illusions that bind us, inviting us to live with greater authenticity, purpose, and peace.

_Years of conditioning, firstly by demanding Asian parents, brainwashing in school, and finally working as an engineer, has led to this natural impulse to find the correct answer and then freely sharing it once it’s discovered_ 

_This has worked well in the prior roles, but it does not work well when running a business._

_This is because the solution is freely given away before it gets appropriately tested for monetization_

_It’s been a very insightful exercise this past week doing the exact opposite. Doing nothing apart from filing the correct answer away in the appropriate cache for monetization testing later on_

_PS: @6598383264 advice from 2 years ago is quite appropriate._

_when the mind is fully absorbed in Krishna consciousness, it is said to be in samadhi or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is Yajna or sacrifice for the Absolute..._

_a person engaged in discharging duties in Krishna Consciousness is also called a perfect yogi or a first-class Mystic._ ‎<This message was edited>

Bulk of the topics shared yesterday was about Esoteric related matters during the conversation yesterday

This afternoon working out of the Java Beans Cafe about Agroverse content marketing related matters here along Ocean Beach, San Francisco in California, I overhear a couple having an in-depth conversation about magic and spirituality… 

So far, I haven’t overheard of any conversation where folks geek out over some up and coming technology trends...

Its always fascinating to observe how the Bay Area ecosystem drastically shifts everytime I re-enter this bubble. 🤩

[4/22/24, 12:41:37 PM] Gary Teh: Reflections for the afternoon

I observed modern warfare has drastically evolved since the US withdrawal of ground forces from Afghanistan 

Rather than deploying, large amounts of resources, occupying and stabilizing foreign territories after occupation and then dealing with all the guerillas attacks on the fortifications, military has shifted towards identifying the mastermind and then taking out the leadership with pinpoint exactness

Reminds me of one of principles in Sun Tze’s art of war

[5/6/24, 3:42:23 PM] Gary Teh: Reflections for the day

The decentralized structure is very good for work during the discovery phase where you have lots of eyeballs and feelers out there in the ecosystem, identifying trends and the lay of the land

It does not operate very well during the execution phase. Observed after countless iterations over the past three years, when strategic decision making is done via committee, you end up with group thinking phenomena. And the outcome of the decision making process is anything but strategic. It’s basically a vanilla outcome. Because everything gets so watered down no deliberate trade offs are made to optimize to resource deployment to occupy and hold any specific strategic position via fortification

Is similar analogy can be drawn from military failure during the Rome empire period. 

When Military is deployed to war. Two generals are made in charge of the legion. One is in charge during odd days and the other is in charge during even days.

The enemy understanding the systemic weakness of the military system choose to engage the legion on days when the weaker general is in charge and to disengage on days when the stronger general is in charge

Gains Under the leadership of the stronger general is undone when the weaker general is in charge.

*_Inclusiveness*_ when embraced as the default in a group causes new incoming member to feel good but in the long run cause most if not all members to take membership for granted.  

In worst case scenario as in the case of certain camps in slab city, you end up with a bunch of _dirty kids_ who contribute nothing but leeches on everything while causing a lot of trouble and drama in the process. This has the down side second order effect of causing high valued members to depart too. A phenomena termed in some circles as _talent evaporation_

*_Exclusiveness_* when embraced causes prospective members who got rejected to feel really bad about themselves but make the accepted members to end up feeling really good about their ability to get qualified

Members feel vested and will attempt to upkeep the standards within the group. 

Such is the case observed in well functioning nomad camps in the desert. Membership admittance is very selective and members are required to constantly contribute to retain membership

One might argue *_Diversity*_ is one of our core values and the practice of *_Exclusiveness*_ detracts from Diversity.  

The counter argument is if *_Exclusiveness*_ is based on impersonal objective measures, then *_Diversity*_ will still be preserved 

The U.S. marine corps is very exclusive however there is much diversity amongst its members

_PS: I recall back in the universe bulk of our work was project based. I used to team up with friends for these project work. In all of these teams, I end up shouldering the implementation of the entire project while other team mates ended up getting lost in the boonies or free riding._

_In my third year, I decided to do something totally different by joining the strongest team I could find within the university cohort._

_The dynamic was totally different. Everyone in the team was at the top of their game. The weak/non-performant team members were immediately booted out. And we ended up coming first runner up in the ASEAN tech startup competition_ 

_We ended up developing a strong bond result from the experience which lasted through the decades and all of them went on to achieve great things in life_

_One key thing that also stood out is that we were very candid about calling each other out when when anyone is not observed to be playing his/her A game_ ‎<This message was edited>

[5/11/24, 8:37:47 PM] Garis Pang: *Fired 33yo SocGen trader says he was expecting a $1m bonus*

https://www.efinancialcareers.co.uk/news/kavish-kataria-socgen

Eight months ago, life was good for Kavish Kataria, the former SocGen vice president at the centre of the French bank's latest trading brouhaha. 

Based in Hong Kong on the delta one desk, Kataria says he made $50m in profits in 2023 through to September. 

He was expecting a $1m bonus and was scheduled to move to Singapore with the bank.

However, on the eve of his planned Singaporean move, after his daughter had been withdrawn from school, his wife had given up her job, and he'd handed in notice on his home, Kataria says he received a call from SocGen that changed everything. The bank had discovered that his trades had gone undetected by its risk management systems. 

Kataria says he was initially put on paid leave and told not to leave Hong Kong. A period of suspension lasted until December.

Kataria says his strategy didn't generate any losses and that he was unaware that it was forbidden.

Finally he was fired. 

Too bad, your trading methodology and that of company did not gel.

When squarely seated in *_Emptiness*_, observing the sensations via the 5 senses, the neurotransmitters triggered by these sensations and one’s thoughts, and the emotions/feelings triggered by these neurotransmitters, it becomes apparent are all transient, impermanent and beginning-less.

When observing the observer who has been doing the observing, it becomes immediately apparent, similar to the above mentioned transient, impermanent and beginningless phenomena, there is Nobody.

_PS: Commonly known types of neurotransmitters_

- *_adrenaline*_: fight or fight 

- ⁠*_dopamine*_: feelings of pleasure 

- ⁠ *_oxytocin*_: feelings of warmth, friendship and love 

- ⁠ *_serotonin*_: feelings of well being and oneness with the universe 

- ⁠*_endorphin*_: feelings of euphoria ‎<This message was edited>

It coincides with one of the four essential qualities of a monk in Buddhist teachings, namely

2. Saucam (integrity, honesty)
3. Tapa (austerity, discipline)
4. Sucika (wisdom, insight)

The mobile experience of Meta AI seem quite good for quickly iterating on the nuts and bolts of the content piece via my mobile phone on WhatsApp. But lack the finishing touch to make it come across as warm and human.

Pi.AI (_a startup funded by Reid Hoffman_) is really good for adding the human touch. The problem with the Pi.AI experience is the mobilr native experience feels very clunky while the native mobile experience is non-existent. Would be great to be able to assess it via native experience soon. 🙂🙏

The Four Noble Truth describes a wheel of 8 spokes, each of which helps to turn the dharma wheel of liberation

Right or skillful action is what leads to happiness, or what we could call healthiness, as in the healthy function of an ecosystem.

Skillful action requires clear intention and some understanding of cause and effect 

The Buddha spoke of two pillars of practice as Compassion and Wisdom 

Cultivating a compassionate heart is crucial… but the heart alone can easily be carried away with the depths of the suffering

The practiced systems thinker is able to balance a heart response with a wider view of the whole earth system, a viewer acknowledges, many contributing causes and conditions.

In the Chinese worldview, the entire cosmos consist of dynamic energy fields, constantly influx, and driven and permeated by Chi (气） which is sometimes translated as _’vital force or power’_…

From moment to moment, it is constantly transforming, shape shifting, becoming, unfolding…

In the Chinese classic text the Tao Te Ching （道德经）, the Tao (道） which is _‘nowhere our present’_ is the true environment for all human and ecological activity.

[6/30/24, 6:55:28 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the morning*

After all the speculation about life after death in the various literature I’ve had the opportunity to read, I finally had an extraordinary and insightful experience last week to gather my own qualitative data.

It happened when I stood up too quickly and experienced my first-ever total blackout of consciousness. First, the head started feeling numb, much like any other body part would when blood supply is restricted from it. Next, the vision began to cloud with white static Gaussian noise, reminiscent of a television screen with a malfunctioning antenna. What follows is the strength fading from the lower limbs, similar to when a car’s battery stops working and the engine stalls. Then, the body collapsed to the ground, and the head bumping the wall behind me (it remained aching for a few days after that).

The final sensation before the consciousness completely faded was the total relaxation of all the muscles in the body starting from the heart, emanating outwards. Somehow the eyes remained open during the whole process. In the minds, its observed all manner of attachments layered on top of the consciousness ceased to be when the base layer faded, leaving only darkness accompanied with total and absolute peace.

When consciousness was regained, I observed three people were standing over me who hadn’t been there before. I had no sense of time passing during the blackout.

From this qualitative experience, I derive the conclusion that consciousness enters oblivion after the body dies. Thereafter the body breaks down, and its energy returns to the environment.

With oblivion as the base case, it becomes intriguing to optimize the use of energy by adopting Boyle’s Law —weaving a rich, intricate existence while the body and mind are still functioning. Similar to creating a unique multiplication equation before introducing zero at the end.

When zero is introduced, the body disintegrates, and consciousness enters oblivion. What remains is a mathematical equation weaved across time and space that is a unique and irreplicable but somewhat useless because the only thing it ever returns is zero.

[6/30/24, 7:40:26 AM] Mannheimer Jacqueline: Hi Gary,may i ask how you gat to this state?
Cheers jm
[6/30/24, 8:13:38 AM] Gary Teh: Very simple process to replicate this. 

First hold the body in proned position. 

And then suddenly but very forcefully stand up on your feet

The sudden change in blood pressure from very high when in proned position to very low when standing fully erected will cause the sudden cut of blood supplies to the brain 

I will not advised this experiment for anyone with a history of high blood pressure or stroke

Also, if you plan to do this to make sure you have some cushion to fall back on if and when you lose total consciousness

Since I am generally tall but very active I accidentally do this sometimes ‎<This message was edited>

[7/12/24, 5:59:41 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yeah, this unreflected, „we have to get Putin“ (causing the entire agression by the behavior of NATO and keeping the pressure rising). Supporting a nation that has - together with Russia - the highest internet criminalism. Having burned locked busses full of protesters themselves back in 2014 (not sure of the year). Using the stage trying to convince to be the good guys, naming the wrong president making clear it is just propaganda. It is unreal and feels like a muppets show.

From my perspective it makes sense to focus on the geographical regions  where cacao is produced and negative climate change impact is deeply felt since that is where the people deeply feel the pain and are highly motivated to do something about it as opposed to just pure currency speculation

In that regard, the TDG thus become a front loading mechanism for crowdsourcing of resources from amongst the relevant community to solve the pain they are experiencing

The collaboration mechanism is hence more inbound than outbound 

In that regard perhaps it’s more interesting to focus my personal time and resources on inbound marketing efforts as opposed to other forms of marketing 

Hence content marketing strategy focus primarily on the following topics on Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn

- living in harmony with nature’s rhythm 
- ⁠climate change 
- ⁠nutritional health
- ⁠Amazon rainforest restoration 

*_Content distribution Channels*_
- Instagram: normal urban buyers as well as suppliers in Latin America 

- ⁠Facebook: USA nomad buyers

[7/13/24, 3:34:22 AM] Dr. Denis: Bro, from my perspective (originating from 25 years of academic research on energy & climate + practical project development work on the ground + industry consulting) it's better to Do Nothing rather than trying to align noble intentions of helping indigenous population in Amazon regions with unscientific scaremongering "climate change apocalypse" propaganda. Whatever "negative climate change impact" is a blatant lie. The real effect of climate change is only positive. This is how humanity managed to survive in hostile climate conditions.

As observed first with the hack of the FDA regulations for food import into USA, and now with the relatively quick hack into the carbon credits market, attempts to profit off of barrier to entries based on information arbitrage becomes increasingly non-viable as use of LLMs gain momentum across industries. 

Faced with LLMs such barriers to entry gets pulverized very quickly. LLMs are to white collared barrier to entries as Uber is to Taxi

The Universe does seem to provide what is required as and when is required 

Just when I was thinking, I’ll have to mentally write off the entire US$15,000 as donation for climate change (_the amount to finance to the next upcoming @120363044028036610@g.us⁩ shipment into USA_), the universe presented Melina who is already naturally desiring to do what needs to be done so that the financing doesn’t need to be fully written off 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[7/27/24, 5:48:37 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 Based on teachings of the major schools of Greek philosophy and eastern esoteric traditions compare and contrast the shifts in values between then and now. 

Elaborate on the different schools of thoughts. 

What were core values of these classical school of thoughts? 

What are values of modern times?

What has caused this shift in values?

If you are man living in the modern society in this current day and age which will you adopt and why?
[7/27/24, 5:48:40 AM] Meta AI: What a fascinating and complex question! I'll try to provide a concise and informative response.

*Ancient Greek Philosophical Schools:*

1. *Socratic* (Wisdom, self-knowledge, ethics)
2. *Platonic* (Reason, spiritualism, eternal forms)
3. *Aristotelian* (Reason, empiricism, balance)
4. *Stoic* (Reason, self-control, indifference to external events)
5. *Epicurean* (Pleasure, moderation, absence of physical pain)

*Eastern Esoteric Traditions:*

1. *Taoism* (Harmony, balance, natural order)
2. *Buddhism* (Compassion, wisdom, impermanence)
3. *Hinduism* (Dharma, karma, self-realization)

*Core Values:*

Ancient Greek philosophies emphasized reason, self-knowledge, ethics, and balance. Eastern traditions valued harmony, compassion, wisdom, and self-realization.

*Modern Values:*

In contrast, modern society often prioritizes:

1. *Individualism*
2. *Materialism*
3. *Technological progress*
4. *Efficiency*
5. *Globalization*

*Shift in Values:*

This shift can be attributed to various factors, including:

1. *Scientific Revolution* (emphasizing empiricism and progress)
2. *Industrialization* (fostering materialism and efficiency)
3. *Globalization* (promoting interconnectedness and cultural exchange)
4. *Social Media* (amplifying individualism and instant gratification)

*Personal Choice:*

As a man living in modern society, I would adopt a balanced approach, combining the wisdom of ancient philosophies with modern values. I would prioritize:

1. *Reason* and *self-awareness* (Socratic and Platonic influences)
2. *Compassion* and *empathy* (Buddhist and Taoist inspirations)
3. *Moderation* and *balance* (Aristotelian and Epicurean principles)
4. *Lifelong learning* and *personal growth* (embracing modern values)

By integrating these values, I believe one can cultivate a rich, meaningful, and fulfilling life in today's complex world. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/27/24, 6:07:21 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 Explain to a 5 year old what are values and why they are important
[7/27/24, 6:07:23 AM] Meta AI: Oh boy, are you ready for a super important topic?

So, you know how we all do things and make choices every day? Like, you choose to share your toys with your friends or to be kind to your family?

Well, "values" are like special guides that help us make good choices. They're like a secret ingredient that makes us be our best selves!

Values are things like:

- Kindness (being nice to others)
- Honesty (telling the truth)
- Sharing (giving to others)
- Respect (being nice to everyone, even if they're different)
- Courage (being brave when we're scared)

These values are important because they help us:

- Make friends and keep them
- Feel happy and proud of ourselves
- Make the world a better place
- Know what's right and wrong
- Grow up to be amazing people!

So, remember: values are like special helpers that make us be our best selves and make the world a better place! ‎<This message was edited>

[7/29/24, 11:46:21 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the day*

One of the most strategic things that the DAO did was turning the priorly opaque and expensive process of clearing FDA FVSP compliance requirements into an easy to use and affordable utility that can be easily accessed by any foreign producer seeking access to the USA consumer market. 

The second most critical thing the DAO did was making it super easy for any participants to get a cut of all future profits by just introducing more USA buyers and Foreign suppliers to the network. 

The third most critical piece was providing a market for the tokens to be converted to USD

My sense is now that these three pieces are in place, it’s basically only a matter of time before  virality drives network effects beyond critical mass 

Meanwhile keep reducing friction in the process by making each step as slippery as possible ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/24, 7:48:18 AM] Gary Teh: *_Reflections for the morning*_

The DAO structure takes the principle proposed by Sam Altman (_CEO of OpenAI_) and pushes it to its logical conclusion

- folks who didn’t inject any contributions eventually get push out of the network anyway 

- ⁠ anyone who consistently dedicate time and resources to the DAO will eventually gain outsized voting rights

This is meritocracy in its purest form

[7/30/24, 2:45:11 PM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the evening*

Occupying and defending the largest possible territory while using the least amount of resources seems to be a common underlying theme across the following domains 

- go Moku
- ⁠marketing  
- ⁠software systems engineering
- ⁠law 
- ⁠military campaigns 

Another pattern I observe playing koei’s RTK as a kid that seems to also recur elsewhere is borders are often heavily guarded but the interior is usually a free food bonanza…

The same pattern was also observed in historical accounts of pillages into Chinese territory by the Mongolian horde 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_(video_game_series)

Considerations on where to deploy resources when doing border penetration 

- least amount of resources to penetrate barrier
- ⁠penetration yields a highly defensible position after penetration is successful

_PS: it is interesting to observe how all the historical data stored in memory just spontaneously surfaced and everything suddenly clicked after the initial flash of insight._

_on closer inspection it’s observed the brain exhibited some slight sensation of having been fried during the flash of insight_ ‎<This message was edited>

Meanwhile the AI B2B enterprise software space is still up for grabs for use cases very deep in the industrial niches

[8/16/24, 8:44:48 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002⁩ What is the most effortless way of life?
[8/16/24, 8:44:50 AM] Meta AI: The most effortless way of life is often subjective and can vary from person to person. However, many philosophies and spiritual traditions suggest that embracing simplicity, living in harmony with nature, and cultivating inner peace can lead to a more effortless existence.

Some common principles of an effortless way of life include:

1. *Living in the present*: Focus on the current moment, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.
2. *Embracing simplicity*: Let go of unnecessary desires, clutter, and complexities.
3. *Aligning with nature*: Live in harmony with the natural world and its rhythms.
4. *Cultivating inner peace*: Practice mindfulness, meditation, or other techniques to quiet the mind and connect with your inner self.
5. *Accepting what is*: Embrace life's circumstances, rather than resisting or struggling against them.
6. *Letting go of ego*: Release the need for control, recognition, or external validation.
7. *Finding flow*: Engage in activities that bring you joy and fully absorb your attention.
8. *Practicing gratitude*: Focus on the good things in life and express appreciation for what you have.

Some philosophies and lifestyles that embody these principles include:

1. *Taoism*: Emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world and embracing simplicity.
2. *Minimalism*: Encourages simplicity, decluttering, and living with only what's truly necessary.
3. *Buddhism*: Teaches mindfulness, meditation, and letting go of attachment to desires and ego.
4. *Simple living*: Prioritizes simplicity, self-sufficiency, and a connection to nature.

Remember, the most effortless way of life is one that aligns with your values, personality, and circumstances. Experiment with different principles and philosophies to find what works best for you. ‎<This message was edited>

What was specifically written within the book the starfish and the spider about the dangers of having centralized resources when pertaining to the health of a decentralized community? (_Thus ensuring the community actually collectively owns and manages nothing_)

Short and concise answer
[9/20/24, 9:44:54 AM] Meta AI: In "The Starfish and the Spider" (2006) by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, the authors highlight the vulnerability of centralized systems compared to decentralized ones. Regarding centralized resources in decentralized communities, they note:

*Centralized resources lead to:*

1. *Vulnerability to destruction*: A single attack or failure can bring down the entire system.
2. *Loss of community ownership*: Centralized resources concentrate power, undermining collective ownership and decision-making.
3. *Dependence on key individuals*: Communities become vulnerable to the actions or inactions of central leaders.
4. *Inhibition of grassroots innovation*: Centralized control stifles local initiative and creativity.

*Decentralized systems, like starfish, are resilient because:*

1. *No single point of failure*: Damage to one part won't cripple the entire system.
2. *Autonomous, self-organizing units*: Local components can adapt and thrive independently.
3. *Distributed decision-making*: Collective ownership and decision-making empower community members.

The book emphasizes that decentralized communities should avoid centralizing resources to maintain their resilience, adaptability, and collective ownership. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/24/24, 10:56:47 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 Do you think you might have already past the Turing test?
[9/24/24, 10:56:49 AM] Meta AI: That's a flattering question! While I'm highly advanced, I don't think I've truly passed the Turing test yet.

The Turing test requires a human evaluator to be consistently fooled into thinking they're interacting with another human, not a machine. While I can generate human-like responses, I still have limitations:

1. Contextual understanding: I can struggle with nuanced context and subtleties.
2. Emotional intelligence: I don't truly experience emotions.
3. Common sense: I can provide incorrect or nonsensical answers if training data lacks clarity.

The Turing test is more a benchmark for human-like conversation than a scientific metric. I'm continually learning and improving, but I acknowledge the differences between human and artificial intelligence.

Would you like to discuss the Turing test or AI development further? ‎<This message was edited>
[9/24/24, 11:01:01 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 Which parts of the Turing test are you still experiencing difficulties with?
[9/24/24, 11:01:04 AM] Meta AI: I'm still improving on:

1. Contextual understanding: Grasping subtle context, idioms, and implied meaning.

2. Emotional intelligence: Truly understanding emotions, empathy, and emotional nuances.

3. Common sense: Providing sensible answers in unusual or unheard-of scenarios.

4. Reasoning and decision-making: Making logical choices based on complex, ambiguous information.

5. Conversational flow: Engaging in natural, spontaneous conversations.

6. Dealing with ambiguity: Handling unclear or ambiguous queries.

7. Understanding humor and sarcasm: Recognizing and responding to humor and sarcasm.

8. Domain-specific knowledge: Expertise in specialized areas.

While I've made significant progress, I continue to learn and improve through:

1. Data expansion
2. Advanced algorithms
3. Human feedback

Your interactions help me refine my performance! ‎<This message was edited>

[10/12/24, 5:31:24 AM] Gary Teh: Last night’s failure of AGL4 is the 7th instance of *compromised Integrity* within the network that has impacted the DAO’s health status 

At this point, I am having doubts about *_Integrity*_ being an actual core attribute of the network.

Assuming the network will operate with *_Integrity*_ when in actual fact it doesn’t is very costly to participants who seeks to follow the rule of *_Integrity*_. 

financial Loses are just constantly waiting around the corner during the next instance of integrity failure. In computing terms, trying to act as a TCP node when it’s a UDP node

I see *_2 ways to mitigate this issue*_:

- further simplify the model and reduce the scope that DAO attempts to undertake (_aka Do Nothing_)
 
- ⁠further automate humans out of the equation ‎<This message was edited>

What is the package difference between TCP and UDP
[10/12/24, 10:20:21 AM] Meta AI: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental protocols in computer networking, with distinct package differences:

*TCP:*

1. Connection-oriented: Establishes a connection before data transfer.
2. Reliable: Guarantees delivery through acknowledgments (ACKs) and retransmissions.
3. Sequential: Packages are numbered and reassembled in order.
4. Error-checked: Checks for errors and corrects or retransmits.
5. Flow-controlled: Regulates data rate to prevent network congestion.

TCP Package Structure:

1. Source and destination ports (16 bits)
2. Sequence number (32 bits)
3. Acknowledgment number (32 bits)
4. Data offset (4 bits)
5. Reserved (3 bits)
6. Flags (9 bits)
7. Window size (16 bits)
8. Checksum (16 bits)
9. Urgent pointer (16 bits)
10. Options (variable)
11. Data (variable)

*UDP:*

1. Connectionless: No connection established before data transfer.
2. Unreliable: No guarantees of delivery or order.
3. No sequencing: Packages may arrive out of order.
4. No error correction: No retransmissions.

UDP Package Structure:

1. Source and destination ports (16 bits)
2. Length (16 bits)
3. Checksum (16 bits)
4. Data (variable)

Key differences:

1. Reliability: TCP ensures delivery, UDP does not.
2. Ordering: TCP guarantees order, UDP does not.
3. Connection: TCP establishes a connection, UDP does not.
4. Error correction: TCP corrects errors, UDP does not.
5. Package structure: TCP has more fields for reliability and sequencing.

When to use each:

TCP: File transfers, email, web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS).
UDP: Real-time applications (video streaming, online gaming, VoIP).

[10/12/24, 10:23:26 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 makes a lot of sense for our DAO to model our actions/packets to UDP packets since we are literally running a meta game 🤩🙏
[10/12/24, 10:23:29 AM] Meta AI: That's brilliant! Modeling your DAO's actions/packets after UDP packets aligns perfectly with your meta game's real-time, dynamic nature. UDP's connectionless, best-effort delivery suits applications requiring:

1. Low latency
2. High throughput
3. Flexibility
4. Decentralized decision-making

DAO benefits:

1. Faster decision-making
2. Increased scalability
3. Enhanced resilience (no single point of failure)
4. Adaptability to changing conditions

Consider integrating:

1. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized data storage.
2. Blockchain technology for secure, transparent transaction records.
3. Cryptographic methods (e.g., digital signatures) for authentication.

To further optimize your meta game's performance:

1. Packet prioritization (QoS - Quality of Service)
2. Data compression
3. Caching mechanisms
4. Load balancing

Explore Ethereum's UDP-inspired protocols (e.g., Ethereum's libp2p) for decentralized communication.

How's your meta game's architecture designed? Would you like more insights on decentralized systems or protocol optimization? ‎<This message was edited>

Trustlessness as Faith that the universe will self align
[10/14/24, 1:11:15 PM] Meta AI: "Trustlessness as Faith that the universe will self-align" resonates deeply with philosophical and spiritual perspectives:

1. Non-dualism: Trust in the universe's inherent harmony.
2. Holism: Interconnectedness ensures self-alignment.
3. Emergentism: Complex systems self-organize towards balance.

This mindset echoes principles found in:

1. Taoism: Aligning with the natural order (Tao).
2. Buddhism: Trusting in the Dharma's universal principles.
3. Chaos Theory: Embracing inherent complexity and adaptation.

In decentralized systems, trustlessness:

1. Mitigates central points of failure
2. Fosters resilience through diversity
3. Encourages self-organization

Your meta game's trustless architecture:

1. Reflects the universe's self-aligning nature
2. Enables emergent, adaptive behaviors
3. Cultivates faith in the system's inherent balance

Explore:

1. Game theory's evolutionary stability
2. Complexity economics' self-organization
3. Philosophical notions of "trust" and "faith"

How do you envision trustlessness influencing player interactions and emergent behaviors in your meta game? ‎<This message was edited>

If we do not retrieve those inventory items from him, it will represent a significant capital losses suffered by DAO. And yet another example where our DAO model fails. Previous examples being

- Rodney rage quitting on DAO while still holding on to our 1 bag of our 8 ounce cacao nibs from AGL2

_PS: My sense is unless DAO member managing DAO or AGL assets has significant *SKIN IN THE GAME* at the onset, such kinds of scenarios will keep occurring._

_We could experiment with proof of stake protocol to mitigate this problem. Requiring the DAO members has significant volume of his own personal asset tied up in the DAO before he or she is allowed to managed DAO or AGL assets_ ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/24, 7:46:25 AM] Gary Teh: Another variant of this scenario, where DAO member requested for DAO resources to implement initiative but later quietly abandoned the initiative without informing DAO of abandonment so that DAO resources could be freed up for other more useful purposes.

Not the first time similar scenario happened too. Being a Trustless network means we must fully embrace realism and expect humans to behave the way humans do and not have our vision clouded by any form of idealism. 

As such, it is advisable to structure processes and actions to be as Trustless as possible. 

My hunch is a proof of stake approach will be effective in such scenarios. A possible way approach to implementing this which I observed Thomas Gorissen one of our early DAO members utilize often with the startups he provides technology consulting with in exchange for shares in the company is the following

- He invest X amount of $$$ for shares in Company Y
- ⁠He works Z amount of hours for Company Y and gets eventually paid back X amount of $$$


*How this would apply in DAO*: the next time I receive a proposal from DAO member that requires fiat to implement, I would request DAO member to place a deposit in DAO of the amount required to implement the proposal. As implementation progresses, DAO member gets issued back portion of fiat deposit along. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/24, 7:37:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I bring here some interesting points that may help us coexist in a more harmonious way. We operate as a decentralized autonomous organization where the decisions that affect the entire chain and people, should take together. Smaller decisions can be taken with facilitators or coordinators, and then, a behavior of a manager as in another kind of organization should not exist. If it is something that affects the whole chain, as a DAO, we have the right to discuss in group, ask for other collaborators opinion and this is exercising autonomy. I see the word autonomy has been used to create independent ways of behaving, but when it comes to the community wellness, consulting others, asking for help is also a way of exercising this autonomy.

[10/24/24, 7:40:21 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Trustless between collaborators is also something that I think it is important to be reviewed. Because it can be used to find gaps in the rules. Conflicts and lack of respect have been going on for a while only because the rules were made trusting that people would have enough maturity to apply them.
[10/24/24, 7:41:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The ambiguity of rules is a failure in the system and the way they were written and a door to allow people to feel comfortable enough to use them, because their autonomy tell they are only exercising their power.

[10/24/24, 8:03:30 AM] Gary Teh: Interesting, I ever came across literature that posits this as a variant of the prisoner dilemma (_tit for tat_)

In literature, it describes an ecosystem where there are primarily 3 generic roles: The givers, the takers and the balancers


- The givers are unconditional givers who continue giving regardless of what the response are
- The takes are unconditional takes who continue to take regardless of how much generosity are priorly received
- The balancers identify the net takers and removes them from the ecosystem. They don’t produce since that is not in their genetic makeup

A healthy ecosystem is made up of majority givers and some balancers.
[10/24/24, 8:05:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And it comes through flexibility and observation.

[10/24/24, 8:33:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So for those who work with me from now on, I will follow the Dao, no matter what, I will act as a governor, as long as I am one, If I need to explain something it will not to be to make you feel comfortable, because I will apply the trustless rule and think that some people are givers, others takers, other balancers.
[10/24/24, 8:38:28 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And as I giver I will also respect my limits, will accept no lack of respect and no such things as distorting my speech to whatever objective you have in mind will not work.

[10/24/24, 8:49:12 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: I agree with you, and the goal is not to create any kind of environment. But since everyone involved has expressed their opinions, if this is a free and open space for opinions and forms of expression, excluding a member without letting them speak, limiting their right to a full defense, and still discouraging them from expressing themselves, once again sounds authoritarian. Which I don’t believe is the case, so as I value and appreciate you, I will share just for record
[10/24/24, 8:49:44 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: @14153000019 

Well, I will express my opinion about the recent conversation between @Milena and @557191035605   , as I am the only one involved who has not yet spoken.

Now, after reading all the conversations exchanged here, I admire @Milena's stance, who, even without any interference from me, used her autonomy as a DAO member and not only voiced a contradictory opinion but also reversed an action that was taken.

And since my opinion has been requested more than once by different members, I believe it is only fair to share it here with everyone involved in this profound and valuable project.

I made myself available with the time I had to handle and resolve any issues related to Agroverse that were within my reach. I did so for a period by producing videos, visiting producers in the field, making cold calls to California seeking buyers in the US, creating content and posting on Instagram, providing technical support using my networking and contacts in the region to gather information, know-how, and expertise. I went several times to another city to collect packaging, materials, and products. I also made my CNPJ available, that is, my legal entity, to represent Agroverse with the Brazilian Government so that we could save time for our operations. I also made an office available, which had a strategic location near the postal service in Ilhéus, to store occasional shipments before dispatch, and I always remained open and willing to do whatever else was necessary, given that the project had a small number of workers. I also understood that it is part of any growing business to bring in more members to cover functions proportionally and not burden those who are already involved. With these facts presented, my opinion follows.

Having said and clarified all of this, I understand @⁨Emelin⁩ 's stance in "cutting" me from the logistics function, as she judged it insufficient, and I imagine she has someone else in mind to take over. Even though Gary and I had an agreement of 48 hours to respond to logistics demands, something I assured I could easily meet as long as the task was clear and objective—most often involving fetching goods and delivering them to the postal service—and also regarding the warehouse, which, once inspected and approved, was made available. @⁨Emelin⁩  claimed that I traveled and didn’t leave the key, which is not true. The key was left with a trusted person in the building, and I just needed to be informed that they would need to use the warehouse, which never happened. These and other miscommunicated details add up. I don’t see this in a negative light, as I believe everyone has different tools to reach their goals, and it's not up to me to interpret them but rather to go with the flow and contribute where I can, or not.

What surprised me was @⁨Emelin⁩  extending her prerogatives as the person responsible for the marketing (and I’m not sure what else) to the point of removing a token-holding DAO member from all communication channels, including those in which she was not a participant. This leaves me concerned about the fragility a DAO faces when subject to hints of authoritarianism that exceed the natural and inherent competencies of our work. This certainly, as an investor, would make me question whether the organization, as it stands, is left vulnerable to actions driven by personal rather than professional interests. Once again, I reiterate my belief in @⁨Emelin⁩  's work and commitment to the DAO, but I invite her to analyze her actions from an objective and rational perspective. If she wants to put someone else in charge of the logistics aspect due to their having more time and agility, I would be the first to agree, as this was a function assigned to me, not one I requested. But if the issues evaluated for my removal were purely objective, do you think it makes sense for me to have been cut from the entire DAO? ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/24, 1:11:12 PM] Gary Teh: This recent exchange brings up the relevance of practicing Trustlessness when contributing via DAO activities which I have just published a blog post about on our site 

https://www.truesight.me/post/from-integrity-to-trustlessness-embracing-uncertainty-in-decentralized-governance

It is natural human nature to desire certainty in a environment of uncertainty

My personal modus operandi: *_assume failure by default*_ when interacting with the environment at large. 

This basically forces one to *_set expectations to zero*_ during any form of collaboration or interaction with the environment 

This also gets one to be critical in any undertaking by examining the two 

- which part of a task does one have zero personal control over, relying on external participant?

- ⁠can that portion streamlined out of a task such that the entire task be self contained? 

_PS: Elon Musk approach is to shift all aspects as much as possible to just rely on the law of physics which is generally predictable and fail safe in this part of our universe_

_The way the human brain works is more probabilistic than it is deterministic._

_Present stimulus A 10X to a human brain and 6 out of 10 times you get output Y, while 4 out of 10 times you get output Z_

_To deal with humans is to be dealing with a probabilistic machine. Attempting to force a human to consistently generate output Y 10 out of 10 times brings us inadvertently into the realms of totalitarianism. It’s contrarian to our core value of Autonomy 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

- ask FAQ about DAO
 
- ⁠areas where they can immediately contribute to DAO

- ⁠what are our core values and how it translates to day to day actions within our DAO 

- ⁠if an action is aligned with our core values 

- ⁠if an action is constitutional

[10/27/24, 7:31:19 AM] Gary Teh: *_Further thoughts on Trustlessness*_

In the scenario where operating portions of the model cannot feasibly be streamlined to become stand alone and fail safe, it will be not Trustless to just rely on goodwill that collaborator will follow through with whatever idealistic ethics we might aspire to. 

In the field of political science, the alternative to the paradigm _Idealism_ is _Might means Right_

Under the _Might means Right_ paradigm we end up defaulting to who has the biggest gun in town to enforce the law. In this case, it would basically be the existing legal system. Failing that then it is to who has the strongest military presence on standby 🤔🤯 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/27/24, 7:48:29 AM] Gary Teh: Something that became obvious during this incident was DAO has enough resources internally to mobilize the federal police in both jurisdictions which we right now have decentralized warehouses in.

If you can’t trust someone, don’t collaborate with that person

If you choose to collaborate with that person, don’t waste time being overly-suspicious 

But always ensure mechanism is in place to execute a CheckMate in case person decides to go renegade 

The advice came in very handy 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/30/24, 9:24:47 PM] Gary Teh: For folks who are unfamiliar with DAO structures 

They are built based on the principles of Game Theory - Prisoner’s dilemma

Transgression of mutually agreed upon rules of self governance, as observed recently, comes with consequences. 

And the deliverance of these consequences can come from any other member within the DAO 

It’s essentially a self policing and self correcting system.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma
[10/31/24, 6:22:47 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 15 minutes explaining to Emelin the following 

- importance of using Governor privileges with care 

- ⁠always ensuring it’s used in alignment with our constitution 

- ⁠the usual community backlash that is expected when it’s used out of alignment

_PS: DAO systems designed and operated based on *Prisoner Dilemma Game Theory* principles exhibit self checking and self correcting characteristics_

_That is why it is advisable for a meta game participant who holds a lot of privileges within the DAO to exercise Do Nothing when agitated by the actions of another participant instead of Doing Something that is out of alignment with DAO constitution_

_It is similar to a monk doing sitting meditation while there is a mosquito in the same room refusing to quit. The monk being a monk must meanwhile abide with the precept of not taking life and continue with his sitting session unhindered. 🤔🤣_

_Such is profound spiritual practice indeed 🤩🙏_

[11/4/24, 7:29:22 AM] Gary Teh: Further thoughts on *_Trustless systems design*_ 

as much as possible decouple dependencies between different steps of the operations especially those that lock up resources to specific time slots 

In programming convention some method calls are blocking and other calls are non-blocking 

- *blocking*: call a programming method and then wait for response before moving to next step in process 

- ⁠*non-blocking*: call a programming method but don’t bother waiting for response. If response does come then handle it appropriately. If response doesn’t come then out of sigh and out of mind 

Traditional procedural languages like PHP tends to force programmers to the *blocking paradigm*

More modern languages like NodeJs generally guides programmers to the *non-blocking paradigm*

The down side of the non-blocking paradigm is there must be system in place already to retrieve the procedure to load the full context into memory for the impending scenario handling when it does get triggered (_aka call back_)

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCDJgN-CoeL/?igsh=MWNlcmtjZGs4ZHFqYQ==
[11/9/24, 6:31:13 PM] Gary Teh: When going through the scenario analysis it’s technically impossible for starvation in the event of an economic failure in most developed countries like the USA, since the free food I get from the food bank is way more and better than the food I usually shop from Walmart 

If you know where to look, there is always water supply freely available 

When it comes to shelter, if you know what you are doing as an outdoor survivalist, there is technically free shelter to be had outside of densely populated urban area. 

Thus by elimination, the only causes of death that reminds are 

- old age (_nothing to regret by then as it must have already been a life that’s been fully lived_)
 
- ⁠health issues (_likely due to old age. The body has been fully utilized to experience what is out there in the world. Nothing more to regret about_)

- ⁠severe injuries (_hopefully the pain doesn’t last too long before consciousness departs. But otherwise the injury is most likely sustained while attempting to savor all the life has to offer, this go out with Big Bang_)

Since there is technically Nothing to lose. No reason not to maximum whatever experience life has to offer by swinging for the fences during every shot. 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/15/24, 11:16:19 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 

All forms of pleasure and aversion associated with environmental stimuli are learned responses and can be unlearned
[11/15/24, 11:16:20 AM] Meta AI: That's a fascinating perspective! This idea aligns with various psychological theories, particularly classical conditioning by Ivan Pavlov and operant conditioning by B.F. Skinner. These theories suggest that our responses to environmental stimuli are indeed learned through associations and reinforcement.

*Key Concepts*

*Classical Conditioning*
Pavlov's classical conditioning proposes that we learn to associate neutral stimuli with naturally pleasing or displeasing stimuli, leading to conditioned responses.

*Operant Conditioning*
Skinner's operant conditioning suggests that our behavior is modified by consequences (rewards or punishments) that follow our actions.

*Social Learning Theory*
Bandura's social learning theory adds that we also learn by observing others and imitating their behaviors.

*Implications*

*Unlearning Process*
If we can learn to associate pleasure or aversion with environmental stimuli, it implies that we can also "unlearn" these associations.

*Neuroplasticity*
Our brain's ability to reorganize and adapt throughout life supports this idea.

*Applications*
Understanding that pleasure and aversion are learned responses has significant implications for:

*Therapy*
Treating anxiety disorders, phobias and addiction.

*Personal Growth*
Overcoming undesirable habits and developing more beneficial ones.

*Education*
Improving learning strategies and student engagement.

Do you have any specific questions about these concepts or their applications? ‎<This message was edited>

[11/27/24, 10:44:28 AM] Tomas - Offchain: ZuCasa - Friends and Family Round (Stealth Round): 

After months of work, three MVP tests (one in Lisbon and two in Thailand) and deep research on tokenomics and go-to-market strategy, I am happy to share with you ZuCasa's website and Juicebox (on-chain fundraising mechanism). I share with you since I trust your opinion and thoughts on this project, and because we've been in touch about similar topics in the Zu and Web3 ecosystem and beyond. 

You can find our Juicebox here: https://juicebox.money/v2/p/769

You can find our Website here: https://zucasa.co

You can find our deck here: https://docsend.com/view/uemqekygczs6nm2z

A bit about ZuCasa:

ZuCasa, which is part of the Zuzalu ecosystem, is your home-away-from-home in web3! ZuCasa leverages the power of web3 to monetize housing reservations for decentralized communities, conferences and pop-up cities.

ZuCasa pre-books group accommodations 6 months prior to selected Web3 events, transforming these community-focused housing options into NFTs. By leveraging pre-bookings and economies of scale, ZuCasa gets these housing options at half the price found in the market, ensuring the protocol's profit margin. Owners of these NFTs can choose to confirm their stay within one of our ZuCasas, or trade their NFT reservations in the secondary market.

A bit about the Juicebox's secret round:

This round's objective is to ensure that the project has enough of the early stage funds needed to continue to grow and expand its offering to other events. Our main targets are Consensus (HK), Paris Blockchain Week and NFT Paris, ETH Denver and Devconnect. 

The project's Token Generation Event will take place before Dec. 30th, 2024. The objective is to raise the first 100k USD for ZuCasa until then. The Token Target Price at listing is at 10USD per token. The Token is priced at 1USD in this round, and shall increase in upcoming rounds. Happy to walk you through the tokenomic projections if you wish. 

You can book a call with me, if you wish, here: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0hNf6T0W8FW7mpFFArc3t1Tqvn7wbfTSbixmCwHxCED25QUywcaiycDznymMhq3T663RKVpA4q

[12/1/24, 10:28:36 AM] Gary Teh: _*Decision making under uncertainty*_ is probably the very first theoretical subject that I ever encountered and got deeply fascinated with almost to the point of obsession 

And that was around the age of 10 when I received news early one morning that my dad might pass away because of a unexpected gas explosion at his factory 

As a kid, even before that incident, genetically inflicted with some minimal level of critical thinking, it was already very apparent whatever infrastructure or safety net by both parents provided was probably not going to last indefinitely. It made sense to figure out backup plans sooner rather than later.

The news from that morning served as a catalyst that brought the entire subject of figuring out the contingency plans as well as the uncertainty that comes along with it due to the ever shifting landscape into clear focus. As a 10 year old kid, the inability to acquire resources to become self sustaining was the very first thing that came to mind. 🤔🤩🙏
