[6/20/23, 4:11:59 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true for crypto

Gas fees for transactions are actually charges that was why I was asking @31641075825 about which chain the governance token for the other project he was talking about will be on. 

If a chain provider can convince a project to go on to their chain they technically become the toll gate

[10/25/23, 1:35:19 AM] Suheil - Europe: i saw the possibility iin their back office. we can do that once we have multiple products…yet meanwhile i prefer to risk on building direct front….
[6/20/23, 4:13:57 PM] Gary Teh: Will do the full 5 year financial modeling tomorrow to get a sense of the growth rate of our DAO’s cash position via this project tomorrow
[10/25/23, 12:00:37 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I understand that you and Kevin will be working on the brochure that we will be circulating to the retailers / franchisers we will be reaching out to.

I will just go ahead and compile a contact list of the small shop retailers we should be reaching out to here in the Bay Area
[6/20/23, 4:13:58 PM] Suheil - Europe: We will need to build it up on DAO'a private chain ...actually semi off on chain mix.

What i meant by that 

The registered association legally speaking will have it'd own private tokenized environment using the decentralized
[10/25/23, 12:01:30 PM] Anupa/diya: Is there a buyers wholesale brochure
[6/20/23, 4:14:23 PM] Suheil - Europe: So its like if I tell you how the dictator of China did but without being bad people just utilizing the tech for ngo in-house purposes

[6/20/23, 4:23:23 PM] Gary Teh: And this statement you made is correct

I know the technology full stack from end to end as well as how each layer makes money that is why I am so anal who owns which layer of the stack

If done wrongly it’s like the bunch of us spent all out money to go around the world to build a successful business and once the business is built we hand off the passive income to 1Inch network on a silver platter while we own nothing of it

That to me is just stupid

I might as well go sit by the beach, drink my margarita and do nothing. Save myself all the hassle and my cash too 🤣

It will never be economically viable if when each start up will pay different agencies or designers to just make designs and then choose whichever .... this sounds more like mentality of royal families how they waste their money on projects 🤣🤣🤣

[10/26/23, 8:02:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Things that might help: use our own brand illustration as possible, avoid using dynamic texts too much, texts must come aligned to the left or centered, and give some space between the Insta name and the pictures/videos.

We are just riding on their marketing efforts by presenting our CTA at their events ‎<This message was edited>
[6/21/23, 9:16:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: Lol I didn't understand this cost no I change my opinion as an experienced business entrepreneur with many proven track records this cost is not justifiable at this level at all!
[10/26/23, 8:33:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I added the Halloween event on the page, added the Instagram adress in two sections (still think we need to rethink the experience with the tracking your package and share with us your story - because it requires some attention of a social media schedule to show people how to do it and why to do it (a 3 posts slide would work) and sent Suheil two templates that can help with the posting, reminding to use our own identity. The time was 23:20 to 00:29.
[6/21/23, 9:16:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: Which starting level business or project makes it viable to spend 7-10k on only design !
[10/26/23, 8:33:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I saw it.
[6/21/23, 9:17:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: U need licensing u need to start selling u need to pilot
[10/26/23, 8:33:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanls
[6/21/23, 9:17:05 AM] Suheil - Europe: Then u can spend as a corporate lol
[10/26/23, 8:33:29 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanks
[6/21/23, 9:18:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: @14153000019 you are 100000x smarter than me in math how u think is that viable by numbers ?

[6/21/23, 9:42:20 AM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: Thats value equal to what we spend on out product.
[10/26/23, 8:38:08 PM] Gary Teh: That is wonderful!

Will follow up with @16468233438 when I meet him tomorrow to get more details about the night market

Also we are going to be partnering up with Edge and Node for their anniversary celebration event on the 9th of Nov
[6/21/23, 9:44:10 AM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: We have a single goal. Sell nibs on Amazon. Make profit.   Move forward slow and steady.
[10/26/23, 8:39:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Obs: we should have a section with pictures from the events that redirects to the Instagram as well. As it is done in the shop part. Any opportunity we can use to make people curious about Agroverse, we should use.
[6/21/23, 9:45:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: Agree
[10/26/23, 8:39:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I wrote some "what I get in return if I go to your event?"
[6/21/23, 9:45:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: We are bootstrapping its about advancing not spending :)
[10/26/23, 8:42:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: "You will taste our fine cocoa drink and benefit your diet by having the opportunity to talk to our collaborators and learn more about the world of cocoa."

[6/21/23, 9:47:55 AM] ‪+57 313 6732781‬: But bootstrapped
[10/26/23, 8:43:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This should follow as well to social media.
[6/21/23, 10:16:23 AM] Anupa/diya: The fact that work has been already done has to be taken  into account . What we can do is the work done till now gets tokenized. 

We can look into the second option and see which one is opted by the DAO  

However going forward. We should have a bid for any  given work and the dao should choose.
[10/26/23, 8:43:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Always tell the benefits of being there and not saying "you can taste". Just "you will taste"
[6/21/23, 10:16:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Mid way selections are counter productive
[10/26/23, 8:44:04 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok, now going to sleep
[6/21/23, 10:18:13 AM] Suheil - Europe: Rephrase the voting and let's vote :)

The voting should say:
Should we spend 7k to re do another set

Such make huge difference.... according to my personal opinion :)
[10/26/23, 8:45:53 PM] Val Lapidus: As far as I know no tickets necessary
[6/21/23, 10:19:58 AM] Anupa/diya: We can see which direction with both the options but let this just be for now.
[10/26/23, 8:47:55 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is a wix thing. If it is paid or free they generate a ticket but there says it is free just right away, I added to the title. I will look again tomorrow how to drift this feature they have. They generate a ticket even if it is free.
[6/21/23, 10:28:30 AM] Gary Teh: Please update your vote
[10/26/23, 8:48:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will go further tomorrow.

[6/21/23, 10:42:11 AM] Gary Teh: You can choose to abstain as well.
[10/26/23, 9:00:26 PM] Val Lapidus: Our event was great everyone loved the hot chocolate and our CTA felt like it resonated.  I covered three major points in my convos:
1.  Cabruca farming
2. 36% vs 6%
3.  Blockchain to document supply chain

And closed with give us a follow on insta

We met a reporter Rachel Wolfson who reports on web 3 projects and hopefully we can nurture that relationship.
[6/21/23, 10:42:32 AM] Suheil - Europe: The question is wrongly formulate
[10/26/23, 9:28:04 PM] Val Lapidus: Spent 1.5 hours just now. Cleaning up after our cacao making exercise

[6/21/23, 10:45:45 AM] Suheil - Europe: Simply doesn't represent the reality 🤷‍♂️
[10/27/23, 9:34:39 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm about to send this to designer for a menu mockup:  please provide feedback if you have some: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OT7Gn1k1GvPIpb4vUlC1CRtiygxvXpP6Nuznc2oSHsk/edit
[6/21/23, 10:47:10 AM] Anupa/diya: We have to see which part of the process we can do this kind of intervention.

We can somewhat still do it but from the way forward We have to project management better 

If we have multiple people wanting to do the same thing.. which is fine.  We need to have the selection process before the work starts 

On the website .. we should add potential roles for execution . Please can submit their proposals and the DAO works
[10/27/23, 9:53:57 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What designer are you hiring? I have a recommendation of someone from here.
[6/21/23, 10:47:12 AM] Gary Teh: If Alessandro and his wife wants to spend GBP 7K of their own free will to advance the DAO, then it is their choice to do so.

What is within our scope is to clearly identify what they are trying to contribute and then determine if it will be of use to us.
[10/27/23, 9:54:36 AM] Val Lapidus: i have a personal friend that does all the work for me
[6/21/23, 10:48:18 AM] Anupa/diya: The Finance is one thing but it's also acknowledging the time and effort that is put in.
[10/27/23, 9:54:59 AM] Val Lapidus: he is a contributor to the DAO
[6/21/23, 10:51:25 AM] Gary Teh: The reality that second set of designs are still up in the air. Who knows they might just change their mind after my email response to them. 

The universe will take care of itself. I spend my time on items on the critical path.
[10/27/23, 9:55:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok. In case he can't help, I have someone close to me as well.
[6/21/23, 11:04:44 AM] Gary Teh: Please just submit your vote and let's move it. I will base my follow up actions with Alessandro and Maria according to the outcome of the vote.

Also once they provide the itemized breakdown of the items they would like to contribute, we can discuss here and then pick and choose what we need regarding items from the list.

I would be curious about how the logo and packaging rendition would look like based on their interpretation of the brand positioning and mood board that Fatima crafted. 

The recent portfolio they submitted as reference seems really well done

https://www.goldenleafoflondon.org/

Also if what they say is true, they will be putting a full time employee on the tasks. So timeline wise, it is likely execution speed via that route might end faster than @972543523823 who only has weekends to work on this. So very likely both set of designs will become available at around the same time. So timeline wise, we should not be expecting much additional delay in the execution of our critical path.

The fact they will be able to throw in a website is a huge bonus. This is taking into account, other than Shadi who has been brought in to work on the website, no one else in the DAO has bandwidth for that. And Shadi is not able to execute at the pace expected had I the bandwidth to do the execution myself. 

My sense given his kind of pace, we will only expect a main website up by end of this year (if it happens) the earliest we will be expecting a dedicated site up for Agroverse via Shadi's route will be end of next year. 

So in conclusion, when I surface propose, I always have timelines and deadlines accounted for in the back of my mind.
[10/27/23, 9:55:16 AM] Val Lapidus: ty!
[6/21/23, 11:54:47 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a break now. 

Items 1,24 are completed. Will work on item 3 once I get back
[10/27/23, 10:11:52 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps a profit share model with each event organizer.

[10/27/23, 10:12:23 AM] Val Lapidus: No profit share these types of events. Usually just have a flat fee

[10/27/23, 10:12:35 AM] Val Lapidus: We don't want to profit share profit. Sharing is a worst case scenario for us

[10/27/23, 10:20:55 AM] Anupa/diya: Can't we use psd  mockups
[6/21/23, 2:57:30 PM] Gary Teh: And all my checklist items for the day are done
[10/27/23, 10:21:24 AM] Gary Teh: Whatever drives conversion and 💵💶💷💴💴💸🤑 🤩🙏

*Flat fee*
DAO bears the risk of both inventory and storefront 

*Profit share* 
risk shared between event organizer and DAO. 


*Profit share*
Seems more scalable since the only risk DAO bears is inventory risk which we are bearing at cost

Incentives are aligned

Otherwise event organizers organize a shitty event and DAO paid for shitty event ‎<This message was edited>

Would be great to get the quotation from your friend too
‎[10/27/23, 10:29:53 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[6/22/23, 7:57:13 PM] Gary Teh: Primarily the strategy around our initial distribution channel is keyword based growth hacking. There are keywords when used in the amazon listings will boost visibility and drive sales. So long as we know there is demand then its primarily about optimizing the use of these keywords when generating the product listings
[10/27/23, 10:34:11 AM] Val Lapidus: We should be targeting events that have decent venues that guarantee a certain number of attendees. I think there are ways to mitigate this risk by doing research on the event seeing past event participation, talking to vendors who were at the event previously, things like that can certainly mitigate the risk
[6/26/23, 6:47:51 AM] Gary Teh: Personal Focus for the day

[10/28/23, 11:46:02 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 this question came up last night about cabruca method 

How do we ensure we do not overpopulate the undergrowth of the canopy with so much cacao trees it crowds out other species and decreases biodiversity?

Can you help provide answer?

I am sure this question will come up again when we present in crowd who are knowledgeable about environment and sustainability 

Thank you 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/28/23, 8:57:34 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: As it is a shade-tolerant plant, it grows well in understories and thin forests, making it an extremely conservationist crop for soil, fauna and flora. Little mechanized, it is a culture that provides a high degree of employment generation. It found in the south of Bahia one of the best soils and climate for its expansion.

The State of Bahia is the largest producer in Brazil, but its production capacity was reduced by up to 60% with the advent of witches' broom, caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, currently Moniliophthora perniciosa.

The cocoa production system in Bahia is known as cabruca, an agroforestry system, where the fruit is grown under trees in the Atlantic Forest, having great importance for the preservation of the forest.

Items on the hot seat:
----
    - DApp to allow DAO members to vote on rake rate (Myself and @31641075825 )
    - Legal document to make corresponding NFT issue binding (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Legal document to enforce proper use of funds gathered from NFT issue (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Exclusive distribution rights agreement signed with Bahia Brazil (myself)
    - Content for product listing page (@918017107841 let us know if you are already done and @972543523823 can take over)
    - Create GS1 barcode number (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)
    - Figure out the exact warehousing location to ship our goods to in USA (Me)
    - Follow up to ensure DUNS number is finally issued (Me)
    - Define go to market strategy (I am aware that @31641075825 promised to do it. Ay this point, I doubt he has the bandwidth to undertake this. I am inclined to relief him of this)
    - Content for Amazon seller profile page (@918017107841  please let us know when the first draft will be available)
    - Get TradeMark registered (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)

    - create the google form to allow DAO members to vote on rake  rate. 

        - this will help determine the commission rates to charge for the loan proposal that @554792626338 is surfacing

        - this will also help determine the mark up rate for the cacao raw materials that @573136732781 is trying to buy from the DAO that we right now have in stock
[10/29/23, 9:24:00 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002  could you check through the document that @16203326626 shared to see how we can further lower lead content within cacao nibs imported for future shipments 

Current level is still 10X of FDA recommendations
[7/6/23, 11:00:20 AM] Gary Teh: - this will also inform the pricing markup which we will be presenting to the Brazilian buyer on the healthcare products  sourced from USA

I doubt it’s for Mailan’s facility 

What I am aware is that there are three processing facilities for roasting, cracking and winnowing 

Each farmer has their own fermentation and drying facility 

There are more than 600 plus farmers in the network. 

Seems like a great use case for using blockchain to track the supply chain network 

That way when a report is issued and the lead and cadmium is above threshold we will know which facility in the network is faulty and needs rectification

what are the disadvantages to using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product
ChatGPT
Using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product can raise ethical and practical concerns. Here are some of the disadvantages:

Exploitation: It can be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals for commercial gain. Homeless people may be desperate for money and may agree to participate in marketing campaigns under coercive or exploitative conditions.

Stigmatization: Involving homeless individuals in marketing and sales may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas associated with homelessness, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of this group.

Dignity and Privacy: It may compromise the dignity and privacy of homeless people. Marketing and sales activities often involve public exposure, which can infringe on their personal space and comfort.

Unintended Consequences: Using homeless people in marketing may draw negative attention or backlash, leading to unintended consequences for both the brand and the individuals involved.

Ethical Concerns: Ethical questions can arise about whether the compensation and support provided to homeless participants are fair and adequate. This includes concerns about fair wages, working conditions, and access to healthcare and social services.

Short-Term Solution: Using homeless individuals in marketing and sales does not address the root causes of homelessness, which are primarily related to housing, employment, mental health, and social safety nets. It may be seen as a short-term, superficial solution to a complex social issue.

Dependence on Exploitation: Relying on homeless people for marketing and sales may perpetuate a system where vulnerable individuals become dependent on such opportunities instead of receiving appropriate support and assistance.

Risk to Brand Reputation: Associating a brand with the use of homeless people in marketing can lead to backlash, harm brand reputation, and result in boycotts or negative public sentiment.

Legal and Regulatory Concerns: There may be legal and regulatory challenges, such as ensuring that all participants are adults who have provided informed consent. Employing homeless individuals without addressing labor and employment laws could lead to legal issues.

Lack of Expertise: Homeless individuals may not have the necessary expertise or training for marketing and sales roles, potentially affecting the effectiveness of the campaign and customer experience.

It is important for businesses and organizations to consider these disadvantages carefully and explore alternative ways to support homeless individuals that are more ethical and sustainable. These may include partnering with charities and organizations, providing job training and housing assistance, or actively participating in efforts to address homelessness in their communities.
[7/13/23, 8:18:35 AM] Suheil - Europe: written on it
[10/30/23, 10:58:51 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 that's not to say I am against hiring of homeless.  On the contrary, I'd be happy to hire them for package and back of house activities, and am happy to pay them more than minimum wage.
[7/13/23, 8:20:02 AM] Gary Teh: The associated brand also needs to be already registered in their brand registry.
[10/30/23, 10:59:53 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you use homeless in your marketing/sales you will jeopardize our brand and our marketing efforts for franchising
[7/13/23, 8:20:26 AM] Gary Teh: The trade mark needs to be registered with the US government before the brand can be accepted into their registry
[10/30/23, 11:01:07 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you are going to conduct experiments with homeless in sales/marketing than please do so using a different brand other than Agroverse, and only once the efforts are deemed successful you can attempt your experiments on Agroverse.
[7/13/23, 8:22:43 AM] Gary Teh: I will also be sourcing for a certified kitchen facility in Silicon Valley which I could utilize by the hour to pack the cacao nibs into. 

That way, the 22 bags of cacao nibs created from the 5KG of supply can be sold in the USA without too much concerns since the manufacturing facility used in the USA is already on the FDA registry

Mono (single) and gamy (exclusive) are not what I have in mind.

[10/30/23, 8:50:16 PM] Gary Teh: For example @5511982667030 has her ideas about how the products should just be about cacao nibs 

Since @16468233438 is doing the execution it’s his call how he wants to modify the products to become drinks instead 

While @16468233438 was busy I was messing around with the recipe. Since it was my execution, while @16468233438  has his opinion, since I was doing the execution, I did it my way 

I know Annia designed the T-Shirt but since @16468233438was placing the order with the printer he could decide which design he wants

But since I was paying for the shirts when I picked them up, it was my call to buy another t-shirt for the homeless whom I wanted to run a social experiment on 

All these diversity is by design ‎<This message was edited>

[10/31/23, 10:33:17 PM] Gary Teh: When I was at the Crypto Rockstar conference in Germany earlier in the year, I had the opportunity to speak to the company that Jakob hired to help line up the sponsors for him to close.

It sees there is one person in charge of building the database and another in charge of warming the lead to get to an appointment before Jakob comes in to close the sponsorship deal

It feels like a human supply chain ‎<This message was edited>
[7/17/23, 8:14:34 PM] Anupa/diya: That's why they can't send you samples due to shipping. It must be from the same place I got the stuff.
[11/1/23, 3:04:17 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Good morning guys! A had a conversation with Orlantildes yesterday night. I belive we had a misunderstanding here.  When u guys asked me about the lead on the Cocoa and I talked to Orlantildes about it he didn't notice that I was referring to your Nibs. He thought that it was about a general research that's why he sent me a test made by OFI relative a Cocoa that pass through a industrial method and it  and not a test made by CIC directed to our nibs. Nibs as u know it's about the bean dry toasted and broken and nothing more.

*Outputs*
    - all operations related communications between TrueTech Inc should be handled between @16468233438 and Orlantildes in the future. We should not be utilizing any one else in the guild as intermediaries. 

    - @16468233438 please compile as list of what you want to follow up on with Christino from CIC

    - the load placed on @16468233438 right now is too much. Proposed to reduce scope for @16468233438 

    - exit interview was performed on @5511982667030 who will be leaving the Agroverse project upon arrival of 100kg in USA

    - continued membership in this guild is determined on whether you have an active agenda you are actively pursuing within the scope of this guild 

*Guild member audit*

The following members have active agenda within the scope of the guild
    - @16468233438 ops

So some scope needs to be unloaded. Perhaps *business development* activities since you are trying to straddle both *business development* and *operations* 

interfacing with Christino falls under *business development* scope 🙂🙏

Interfacing with Orlantildes right now falls under *operations scope* ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/23, 3:55:37 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 The next model I'd like to experiment on is one that involves direct sale to chocolate makers
[7/26/23, 12:25:54 PM] Val Lapidus: I think that whatever the profile of the flavor is for each country we should lift that on the bag so that consumers know what they are getting
[11/2/23, 3:56:53 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! Give this current model you are working on a few more iterations. If it works great! We start populating people with it and scale it. If it does not, we drop it.

Let me know what are the different steps you have in mind for this new model that self compounds. Let's update our growth engine ‎<This message was edited>
[7/26/23, 12:27:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, my wife works in impact investing.  Something that they're recently making a change to is instead of having a farmer bee sustainable, they should be a regenerative farmer which means it's better for the environment and for their farmland.  Perhaps we should market ourselves as working with regenerative farmers rather than

[7/26/23, 12:59:08 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 🙂👍
[11/2/23, 6:04:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Our call to action at farmers markets in California should be an outright attack on Nestle
[7/26/23, 3:46:06 PM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 you totally knocked it out of the hall park with this one 🤩

[11/2/23, 6:05:27 PM] Val Lapidus: Something along the lines of :  help end nestlé drink Amazonian rainforest chocolate

[11/2/23, 6:05:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Or let's rid the world of Nestle
[7/27/23, 12:24:39 PM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 would it be possible for us to record the upcoming zoom session? 

That way we can go through it again later and start pulling out all the insights into a document 🙂👍
[11/2/23, 6:25:51 PM] Gary Teh: Test that CTA at the next event 

Can you try to shorten it to less than 7 worlds
[7/27/23, 12:51:48 PM] Iwona Fluda: The insights will be documented during the session, so no recording needed. Per principle to ensure trust and deep collaboration, I don’t record the session. 
P.S. just realized that I was too optimistic to run it next week, might move the date.

[7/27/23, 11:50:41 PM] Gary Teh: Just a random crazy idea, I wonder if it might actually be cheaper to just simply buy a cheap car and park it by the LAX parking lot for USD155 per month for storage purposes. 🤣

[7/28/23, 12:00:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: If that’s legal OK and the microclimate of the car won’t impact the quality of the product - why not?
[11/2/23, 6:30:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Hello there. I remember @16468233438 was against talking about other companies. I don't know what happened but you guys be sure you have good lawyers.

The girl basically created a buzz about the context and how it's used and then launched her own product.
[7/28/23, 6:03:10 AM] Tess walkowski: I personally love circles
[11/3/23, 12:58:05 AM] Anupa/diya: It might be a great way to adopt for social media and other marketing tactics
[7/28/23, 6:03:32 AM] Tess walkowski: Yellow like McDonald's knows makes you hungry

[7/28/23, 8:08:53 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus today
====

    - register our brand with Amazon 

    - setup meetup.com account

    - setup Eventbrite account
[11/3/23, 6:03:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: according to my knowledge that instagram algo differentiates between high-quality posts (specifically the ones that promote sales) and personal.

Your mini-documentary is good for attracting viral audience to build up the community around the philosophy/concept . but we would be very lucky if we can hit 2 birds one stone aka also a concept soldiier and a buyer/client
[7/28/23, 8:23:38 AM] Val Lapidus: That's a lot to manage.  I'd do it for governance tokens
[11/3/23, 6:04:20 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you need to follow up with Orlantildes to get any reference number that Omega services might have issued Coopercabruca for the cacao shipment that is being sent to them in Salvador 

That way, when you reach out to Omega services and attempt to follow up with our cargo to understand the arrangements they have setup with SeaCoastLogistics they will know what we are talking about 

You can get @5511982667030 to support you if you need. Feel free to exercise your autonomy. Critical point is make sure this shipment does not fall through the crack anywhere in the interfacing and disappear 

*Omega services*: outbound freighting company based in Salvador 

*SeaCoast Logistic*: customs broker based in USA

PS: I am making a huge assumption that there is in fact a reference number here. Perhaps there is none. That is for you to go figure out ‎<This message was edited>
[7/28/23, 8:24:47 AM] Val Lapidus: If it's just like 10 kilo it's not a big deal.  But 100 is a lot

[7/28/23, 8:30:14 AM] Tess walkowski: Detroit.  Rent a warehouse in my building.
[11/3/23, 6:07:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: i can’t advance the instagram under “corporate sales” push before it gets surrounded by the community concept/

as corporate sales can easily eliminate the community aspect thus showing us as just “bllablaer’s” and utilizing social as a pretext to just sell a product 🤷
[7/28/23, 8:30:25 AM] Tess walkowski: It's also the shipping
[11/3/23, 6:07:43 AM] Gary Teh: We are using Instagram to sell products
‎[7/28/23, 8:31:19 AM] Tess walkowski: ‎image omitted
[11/3/23, 6:08:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes but we are imitating this strategy… from ur personal story content we are infusing the product to sell .
[7/28/23, 8:32:12 AM] Tess walkowski: I made this.  My network will grow.  6-12 months I'll move cacao for you better than Amazon

[7/28/23, 8:34:19 AM] Tess walkowski: What do you think of doing a cook with nips event or ceremonial nibs
[11/3/23, 6:12:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: ok quiick anallysis of what u sent:

- instagram page with fiirst post 21/02/2020 = beginning of building his instagram community

- a pure product sales page = very clear set of target client and simple  call to actiion “ come buy”
VS our caase

we are telling all stories about farmers and sustainability and change and innovation and and and then oh  please buy to support thee mission
[7/28/23, 8:34:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I want to do a white chocolate with raspberry and could use nibs for that but need the cacao butter too and vanilla lol
[11/3/23, 6:14:55 AM] Gary Teh: 21/02/2020 was two years ago
[7/28/23, 8:35:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Or things for at home keto
[11/3/23, 6:17:09 AM] Suheil - Europe: exactly my point that iit took him that long to reach 3k which obviously they did organic and surrounded the right audience . 

As a designer you are heavily active offline which then get translated into “instagram” . I would be pretty astonished if designer tells me “ ii succeeded to generate my online ssales oonly from instagram”
[7/28/23, 9:37:19 AM] Gary Teh: something like this might us serve well

Tear out the four backseats and we are done. 

All 90kg can be stored in the space that are freed up. 

We can park it by ocean beach SF. The weather is generally chilly here anyways.

[11/3/23, 6:18:24 AM] Suheil - Europe: fashion and clothing iindustry is annia’s expertise. in fact, what made anniia loose her mind with us is that she iis not understanding why we are focusing on community and not just setting up a traditional business page 🤷 
her reaction was liitteraly like : “ i dont understand what you guyz are doiing filming yourself for an instagram page to sell cacao “ hhhh
[7/28/23, 10:24:25 AM] Val Lapidus: Sorry Gary, this is a bad idea. It will get broken into and everything inside of it will be stalled
[11/3/23, 6:20:46 AM] Suheil - Europe: i understand her as she is in pure business mode of how she got used to work and buiild up online shops
[7/28/23, 10:24:32 AM] Val Lapidus: Stolen
[11/3/23, 6:21:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: i cant put KPI’s on building a community 
I can put KPI’s in business language and it will require budgets because i never saw in my life a business succeeding to push onliine sales under a business mode without setting up a long term execution budget for online marketing (like even if its only 100$ /month budget for 12 months doesnt matteer whats the amount but the algo needs money to push sales prooduct
[7/28/23, 10:26:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Or most likely the car itself will get stolen

The rest of the 18 boxes we can keep them in the storage unit for USD17 a month
[11/3/23, 7:10:58 AM] Anupa/diya: @31641075825 please send me the Amazon details for tracking . @16468233438 do I let you know once the sale is made ?
[7/28/23, 11:05:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Honestly I'll charge you $15 a month and it doesn't have to be USD. It can be tokens
[11/3/23, 10:50:34 AM] Val Lapidus: Yes just send me the address and how much they ordered
[7/28/23, 11:05:46 AM] Val Lapidus: Or if you feel like that's too much, you name me a proce
[11/3/23, 10:50:53 AM] Val Lapidus: I was busy all morning and it looks like you already did this. Is there any further follow-up for me?
[7/28/23, 11:08:11 AM] Gary Teh: In tokens would be wonderful. Deal!! 🤩
boomz! 👊🏻

Just to clarify is it for storing of the 2 boxes and handling the fulfillment from Amazon as and when they come in?

   Step 3 - sign agreement with and pay FSVP agent USD3000

    Step 4 - get our FSVP agent to get talk to their QC department to get the paperwork we need from them

    Step 5 - finally ship it over to SFO

Basically guerilla marketing ‎<This message was edited>
[7/30/23, 12:58:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: As mentioned somewheer above, I might move the event as I was too optimistic to run in just in a week .

[7/30/23, 11:26:38 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 would you be keen to help create a draft of what you suggested in the townhall?
[11/3/23, 3:45:54 PM] Emelin - Bahia: You can also make the white part larger
[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: Like a PowerPoint presentation

[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: This is what I did for mine, ours would be different, it's part of marketing umbrella in a way
[11/3/23, 3:51:13 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, I think you're just going to have to design the shirt yourself. I don't think Kevin is going to conform to all these requirements
[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: Something I have on hand that I can send as an enticing email if I ever meet a client

[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: A 3-4 page visual summary of us to potential clients
[11/3/23, 3:51:34 PM] Gary Teh: Ok.
[7/30/23, 12:21:09 PM] Gary Teh: I think it’s also important to figure out how will the partners that you have in mind would benefit from supporting us since they already have their core business and would probably not want to get distract from that.

https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1FS9ran7OUuX6Y5y9hzh7hee1mUU9NNUj_0RYsSr2D20/edit

Once we are done with our focus group, I suggest that we arrange a Zoom session where we meet up to share the insights we have gathered. Thereafter we do a poll to figure out which components in each stage of the AAARR to prioritize since there are literally a whole bunch of options available at each stage.
‎[11/3/23, 5:13:12 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/30/23, 4:00:46 PM] Gary Teh: As @5511982667030 has suggested the other DAO members do not have enough of in-depth context on our project, so prioritization of options voting will be done within this guild

As and when we need help and support we could reach out to the larger DAO via the townhall or the beer hall

That way we could  reduced noise in our collaboration efforts, be more focused in our execution, be more selective in when we tap into the larger DAO thereby also reducing noise levels in the main channels 🙂👍

[11/3/23, 5:24:35 PM] Emelin - Bahia: There are many colors and features
[7/31/23, 10:12:39 AM] Gary Teh: For the few samples we are going to make either in my car or @16468233438 place

If the agricultural cooperatives we are getting our supplies from ends up failing to help us with the packaging and we have to assemble it ourselves and we figure there is demand for powder form too, we might end up assembling the cacao powder bags in a commercial kitchen here in SF
[11/3/23, 5:24:48 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If you aim in the Amazon that would do

@41796560010 and @918017107841 please review these questions and give comments 

Also reference them when figuring out the versions of focus group both of you are conducting

[11/3/23, 5:27:43 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I saw it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[7/31/23, 9:34:25 PM] Anupa/diya: Please add me . Will join if it's time appropriate

[7/31/23, 9:35:58 PM] Anupa/diya: Sure! I had a brief glance.. looks good. I think all of us are pretty much aligned with the same approach
[11/3/23, 5:28:32 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 👍🏾
[7/31/23, 9:36:38 PM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 @16468233438 if you guys could also photograph.  It's good for documentation

[7/31/23, 9:38:37 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 was suggesting once we are done with these three separate focus groups we regroup to start defining the customer personas in keto cacao nibs market segment
[11/3/23, 5:31:27 PM] Gary Teh: That is very true 🤣

I am sure we will need to print another version after this current version
[7/31/23, 10:42:08 PM] Anupa/diya: For sure !
[11/3/23, 5:35:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We can't print t-shirt for when you wake up more introvert or extrovert, you know that, right?
[7/31/23, 10:42:43 PM] Anupa/diya: I was going to suggest the same so the synthesis can feed into the main insights
[11/3/23, 5:35:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Don't be shy, let peple scan you from a reasonable distance. 🙏🏾
[8/1/23, 12:38:21 PM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus today
——

   - block @918017107841 and @41796560010 with the meetup and Eventbrite accounts by allowing them access to gmail account 

    - start recruiting participants for offline focus group
[11/3/23, 5:36:03 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I guess people would not scan just right in your face because that would be awkward
[8/1/23, 12:45:00 PM] Suheil - Europe: Sorry for being outdated.... where geographically u want to organize those focus group in California?

[8/2/23, 8:07:02 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus for today
——
    - recruit 6 participants for the 20th august offline focus group in San Francisco from the Facebook groups targeted
[11/4/23, 10:44:56 AM] Anupa/diya: I went to this lovely chocolate store today and they had a very nice experience of chocolate making process.  They tapped into the 5 senses
[8/2/23, 8:14:22 AM] Tess walkowski: Same issues on stickers and labels
[11/4/23, 10:45:56 AM] Anupa/diya: It got me thinking.... if you guys want... at your events... maybe along with the tasting.. you might want a virtual vr space to experience with cacao making.

I could set something up on spatial.
[8/2/23, 8:16:54 AM] Iwona Fluda: Does the packaging need to be sustainable?
[11/4/23, 10:46:16 AM] Gary Teh: That would be quite cool! How would that work??
[8/2/23, 8:18:21 AM] Anupa/diya: You should ask them what is the issue. The only issue I see couldn't be the dpi High print or they needed an open file. I feel you can just go to neighborhood printer
[11/4/23, 10:46:43 AM] Anupa/diya: Given your costing now. Let's do a prototype
[8/2/23, 8:20:33 AM] Gary Teh: What is the context behind this question?
[11/4/23, 10:47:15 AM] Gary Teh: Is it a website or needs a VR headset?
[8/2/23, 8:22:56 AM] Iwona Fluda: Positioning, etc. I run a social enterprise here in Switzerland, and my aim is to create a 360 degrees social enterprise. That means that all steps on the way need to be social and sustainable. This is also great for positioning, not just because part of my heart beats for it.
[11/4/23, 10:47:39 AM] Anupa/diya: I can use spatial to build a story telling and you guys can get an oculus on rent for people to experience the spatial
[8/2/23, 8:23:56 AM] Iwona Fluda: With the assumption that keto nerds might be also socially and environmentally aware, this could be a great differenciator
[11/4/23, 10:47:45 AM] Anupa/diya: Spatial is like a free metaverse
[8/2/23, 8:24:23 AM] Gary Teh: We will hopefully gain some insights on this during the focus groups
[11/4/23, 10:48:00 AM] Anupa/diya: You can use the laptop or you can use vr to access it
[8/2/23, 8:24:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: P.S. as a nerd myself, I would go for it :P
[11/4/23, 10:48:16 AM] Anupa/diya: We can add all the videos and footage
[8/2/23, 8:25:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is a medicine of the heart, so it makes sense, and the tree grows best like the heart wild and free
[11/4/23, 10:48:25 AM] Anupa/diya: Photos and set up a gallery
[8/2/23, 8:25:36 AM] Tess walkowski: I was thinking about cacao ceremonies for nerds as a fellow nerd
[11/4/23, 10:48:58 AM] Anupa/diya: You guys can play that on site while having the events with vr
[8/2/23, 8:26:17 AM] Iwona Fluda: Im in! Also: just stopped drinking coffee a few weeks ago and move to cacao and matcha.
[11/4/23, 10:49:14 AM] Gary Teh: That would be quite an interesting concept and aligns well with our theme of *Saving our Rainforest with Web3*
[8/2/23, 8:27:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Matcha would also be great to source and import and it's a great comparison
[11/4/23, 10:50:33 AM] Anupa/diya: If you guys can get a vr.. let's do it. I know last year it was huge at the web 3 events.
[8/2/23, 8:27:21 AM] Tess walkowski: Preparing matcha is a ritual
[11/4/23, 10:50:38 AM] Anupa/diya: And it's fun.

We could do a product launch event. have people on spatial .
‎[8/2/23, 9:26:51 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[11/4/23, 11:44:33 AM] Gary Teh: Sounds fun. Exercise your *Autonomy* and go for it! 

Always great to have some *Diversity* in the experience we offer to folks in the community 

*Autonomy* and *Diversity* are both core values of our DAO🤩🙏

[8/3/23, 11:22:45 AM] Gary Teh: While we await for participants, I was thinking through the following aspects of the go to market for our keto cacao nibs 

*The channel*
Which social media platforms to utilize Instagram, YouTube, TikTok…

*The method*
Paying for ads or getting influencers to do the promotion  

*The format*
Text, videos or photos as the primary format 

Once we figure out what the Unique value proposition (UVP) is, we will need to package the UVP and deliver it on the right channel, using the right method and the right format 

*paramters*
The parameters to consider are

    - cost: how much does it cost to. More competition more costly. More channels more costly.
 
    - reach: how many people naturally hang out at the channel 

    - uniqueness: how much can our messaging stand out. More competition using the same format less unique
[11/4/23, 10:48:06 PM] Gary Teh: Here you go
[8/3/23, 11:23:40 AM] Gary Teh: Would be great to get some new ideas on 

    - channel
    - method 
    - format

Once we figure out one that works, I propose we should just double down on it till we hit channel saturation

[11/4/23, 10:57:32 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 once Daniel from the night market responds with the sales revenue information please let us know 

That way I can compile the performance information and have it shared in the Townhall with the rest of the governance tokens holders 

This will help serve as the baseline benchmark for our next iteration

[11/4/23, 11:47:18 PM] Gary Teh: Would you like to follow up and deal with the issue now that you have access to Amazon sellers account as well

@16468233438 until now has not logged into the Amazon account yet

The only folks who have done so thus far are you (@918017107841 ), myself and @31641075825 

I am thinking since @31641075825 and Annia are working on Instagram, perhaps you should oversee Amazon

That way @557191035605 can oversee Wix

Which leaves @16468233438 to just focus on the farmer's market, events sponsorship and fulfilment stuff

I am streamlining the load on @16468233438 plate now as I did yours last month ‎<This message was edited>

[11/5/23, 1:42:56 AM] Anupa/diya: I feel we should find some sort of automated system that collates all sales info from various outputs into one. I am sure there is. Val can just look at that and not depend on the manual process by us

[11/5/23, 1:46:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I have no idea about sales ! I am service design😆 do we have any sales and marketing ?
[8/3/23, 6:02:56 PM] Gary Teh: I believe the package size needs to be just right that the entire package runs out after 30 days of consumption 

That way, customers will be compelled to want to buy another package from us to participate in the same game again next month and win. 

Every month is a new round

[8/5/23, 12:22:13 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 please reference these materials on how to setup an operate an NFT campaign

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXS7gfbjWg0DBlPbTZQig9O-mwhkTb8A/view

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20220329_anika_the_non_fungible_gauntlet.pdf

These were left by Anika who was active in our DAO last year when she was fanatical about NFTs. She has since became inactive, I believe she lost a whole bunch of life savings from her parents investing them in NFTs.

Nevertheless the education materials she acquired are still useful for the NFT campaign that you are working on

So if cash flow from this Amazon account doesn’t turn positive by then the account is going to shutdown of its own accord anyways due to subscription fees bouncing 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/6/23, 7:10:50 AM] Emelin - Bahia: XD
[8/7/23, 10:38:32 PM] Anupa/diya: I was thinking that if we sell this batch through Amazon and other methods we can start the initial run for product circulation and awareness building. We are not selling it as trade and utility tool. The dynamics of that is very different.
[11/6/23, 7:16:09 AM] Suheil - Europe: let me know when
[8/7/23, 10:40:32 PM] Anupa/diya: We should look at time stamping where we have the packet on the blockavhain for Traceability and transperancy. I think that's more valuable at this point
[11/6/23, 7:16:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will, thanks for the info.

[11/6/23, 1:54:49 PM] Gary Teh: If it’s selling hot choclate, you are correct

the bulk of the consensus is the guild just wants to stick to nibs 

Any processing beyond the nibs stage, it is independent of the dao 

The exception would be it is a product that was created in its final form on the farmer’s end and past through DAO network for distribution in USA

The model becomes cleaner in this regard

Rather than becoming a manufacturer we stick to being a distributor 

Otherwise a lot of the value captured along the supply chain needs to stay with us to pay for all these transformation expenses instead of passing directly to the farmers and the cooperatives where they should be ‎<This message was edited>

[8/9/23, 8:10:55 AM] Gary Teh: Too early for NFTs at this point.
[11/6/23, 2:14:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: You can highlight on whitepaper itself and I can work on it on saturday.
[8/10/23, 10:46:06 AM] Gary Teh: If we plan to utilize FoodLens for traceability, FoodLens will charge us 3% of our retail price to generate QR codes linking back to their site which showcases the entire supply chain 

Makes sense to incorporate this if traceability so important that it drives consumer purchasing behavior 

If not, I am not sure why we are introducing this cost component that will eat into our profit margins
[11/6/23, 2:48:37 PM] Gary Teh: Also an insight that became apparent about our DAO after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

I feel we should play to our strengths instead of our weakness

From this perspective, manufacturing is not going to be our strength. Instead distribution is. 

We are not leveraging enough of our strength in distribution and kind of got alittl distracted in the manufacturing side of things ‎<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 10:46:37 AM] Gary Teh: Could you further expand on this
[11/6/23, 3:58:19 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't necessarily agree with any of that.  But at the same time the only difference for me is that I can no longer tokenize the elements required to execute on the path that I'm currently on. I have full autonomy to execute whatever I want to. But now the guild will simply not share in the profit. If I happen to generate one instead, they will only see the benefit of me purchasing the nibs and potentially me reselling the nibs ‎<This message was edited>
[8/10/23, 10:50:47 AM] Gary Teh: *Key personal focus for today*

    - assemble actual package based on Brazil cooperative dimension

    - chat with @16468233438 about how to approach Dean on burning man 

    - figure out if we will use Shopify or a simple Wordpress shopping cart website for Agroverse consumer facing website 

    - reach out to one more financing professional (within John Tan’s network) to get a second opinion on the financing structure for the incoming shipments

About the money we owe to them, pls, check with Gary what is right amount. He is following the transaction more closely.
[8/10/23, 11:21:44 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya there are better ones but this is the most popular . However I feel we need to focus on teh strategy first and more so building the cacao nibs community

[8/10/23, 11:21:53 AM] Anupa/diya: Are we using social media marketing M
[11/6/23, 7:15:54 PM] Anupa/diya: I think the events is a great idea. The retail bussiness is huge and it is a great source for marketing. However There is a huge initial expense involved and more than that it is a lot of work. 

In India there is a huge percentage of small to large  scale entrepreneurs who just sell via markets bazaars to large expos. They extremely well during the holiday seasons. I had seen in London, during the Christmas markets, mulled wine and hot chocolate were high selling drinks 

The Charlie and chocolate factory is releasing maybe some sort of buzz can happen around the Golden ticket 

@16468233438 you can create your own brand called Val's chocolate drink. That can be sub brand for agroverse
[8/10/23, 11:24:27 AM] Iwona Fluda: Yes, but we will be definitely for more than a longer while on the market. 😂

[11/6/23, 10:10:22 PM] Gary Teh: When I think of a DAO and I think of a highly structured labor intensive operation, I just don’t see how these two models can resolve and if it does how. does it sustain itself. House of Balance has been trying to utilize this model to hold large scale events every year. The model doesn’t really facilitate that

When I think even more deeply of the organic behavior exhibited by DAO members over the past two years, I feel  it more readily lends itself to such kind of casual informal impromptu structures

He mentions it would be hard if we don’t know what is the actual material the printer will be printing on 

Would there be a way to ask Orlantildes to get a sample material from the printer and have it shipped over?

There is alot already going on on Orlantildes Bahia, Brazil side. Fatima has spoken with me to propose we have a clear strategy regarding how we interface with Brazil otherwise it will appear very haphazard from their perspective and it will not reflect well on us.

I believe we (TrueTech Inc) will need to maintain our own set of records of our auditing of our foreign suppliers 

If it is indeed true, then there might in fact be a use case for utilizing blockchain establish our track records of auditing our foreign suppliers to meet the FSVP program

    - @918017107841 who had been lobbying for the use of blockchain in our traceability might feel excited because we might now have a very valid use case

    - @16468233438 who mentioned he is keen to build out a tech stack specifically geared towards companies might find this uses case  for FSVP compliance record keeping interesting

Alternatively, you can grind them down like a coffee.  However, if you wanted to do your own chocolate processing, you can get a tumbler specifically made for processing cacao beads into raw chocolate

[11/9/23, 9:10:29 AM] Anupa/diya: Users switch off the moment it doesn't work .
[8/12/23, 7:17:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Also Gary with regards to a potential supplier of Peruvian nibs.  Would it be cost effective for us to do that?  Isn't the point that we are buying directly from the producer Farmer in Brazil or wherever and that is why we are getting a reduction in cost. Wouldn't the Peruvian supplier that has the product already in the US in his price include the cost of getting the product here. So what would be the point of buying from them unless we are handling the export? What are we adding to this? That makes it worthwhile?
[11/9/23, 9:11:47 AM] Anupa/diya: Patience 🤣

[8/12/23, 7:24:26 PM] Gary Teh: You are correct 

It totally negates the story we are telling if we got the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

My original random stupid idea was that if people in the keto community doesn’t really care where the supplies come from then why not just get the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

But a lot more facts has surfaced since that random stupid idea and now to make it obvious that was a random stupid idea.

It is like us buying some stuff from Walmart and then trying to sell you the stuff for a margin when you could just walk down the street yourself and then buy it yourself or just buy online. Totally zero value adding

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdFtZ8YoGMsE0RdQ4hGFINUO8CORap7smzbmQXy4Dj4/edit

Also as suggested by Andrey (former chairman of radical ventures) let’s hold off on tokenizing for now as it makes the legal aspects of the financing more complicated than necessary for this initial pilot test

[11/10/23, 9:56:02 AM] Gary Teh: Back last year during the prediction market project, I have already setup the initial working prototype type for our own EVM based chain 

The code can be found here 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

Didn’t bother to do any further development as that was not the critical action

The critical action was Discovering and Validating a *viable business case* for TrueSight DAO

But as a bootstrap we can have the entries notarized on Ethereum or one of the EVM compatible chains work

At some point it makes sense is to have our own chain and miners as opposed to constantly paying another tech company gas/transaction fees. 

That was what lead to the thinking of *Sunmint* off the grid data center clusters where Our miners will be housed there. 

When I was in Bahia Matheus and Marcel offered their place to run miners. 

Hence it might not even be necessary for us to own the land where SunMint operates on. We run the nodes on the property of the farmers and the gas/transaction fees are paid to them

[11/10/23, 11:27:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is the kind of info on "how it is prepared" and it deserves an "about us" section not directed to the homepage, same process as scrolling down, but to another section.

_Step 2: will get @557191035605 help with brochure design that utilizes the native artwork that she created in our brand guide_

_Step 3: once packaging of the 100KG incoming import is completed and I am done with my 3 week retreat, print the brochures and hit the stores and the manufacturers along the entire west coast of USA_

_PS: @⁨Val Lapidus⁩ perhaps leave some portions of the 100KG unpackaged as my sense is some manufacturer might just want to buy in bulk_ ‎<This message was edited>
[11/11/23, 12:05:28 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 thoughts on 16th arrangement?

*Option 1: 2 pronged operations*

Based on the inputs from Orlantildes, it seems having just one person at the airport will be more than sufficient to load the 100KG on to a rented uhaul van (approximately USD41)

That way you don’t need to be rushing over to the airport and then back to deal with preparing and making available the chocolate drinks for Edge and Node anniversary event

*Option 2: delay the pickup*

Have SeaCoast Logistics pick up the cargo from the airport and then we pick it up after the event. I am sure they will be charging something for that service. Not sure if it is going to be more expensive than USD41. Also judging by the dimensions of each box, I might need to get another transport before I could load the boxes in my car anyways. 

*Follow up*
Let me know your preference by Monday. So that I have enough lead time to arrange for logistics with U-haul services. 🤩

[11/12/23, 7:05:47 AM] Gary Teh: Namaskar! 🤩🙏
[11/12/23, 9:49:47 AM] Gary Teh: *Question 1*
Are you sure it’s exactly 24 hours and not before clock strikes midnight of crossing from 16th to 17th of Nov?

There are some ambiguities there that needs clarification 

*Question 2*
Also SFO is a very large place. 

Which exact terminal or gate should we be heading to to pick up our cargo or are we even supposed going to be heading to the passenger terminals at all? 
Perhaps there is a specific facility we are supposed to report to to claim our cargo when we arrive for the pickup 

*Proposed follow up*
These are two questions you should want to clarify with Graziela on Monday when she is in the office. 

Let me know if you want to do the follow up instead. I only have very little lead time (Tuesday and Wednesday) to respond if _questions 1 and 2_ requires specific arrangements to be made. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/13/23, 11:16:49 AM] Val Lapidus: so as a vendor, i wouldn’t put him for sales at events, he’s a cook not a seller, so that doesn’t make sense.  as for if the DAO is using him.  So now instead of a DAO member working and producing at 100 TDG per hour, we are now increasing the cost.  It doesn’t make sense
[11/13/23, 11:19:02 AM] Gary Teh: He is a cook suitable for the kitchen

He is not suitable for sales 

Vendor has autonomy to do what vendor wants to. 

Just think of vendor as a separate company

DAO does not control how vendor handles things internally. 

And neither can DAO control how individual DAO member executes on things 

The only thing that DAO does is surface what can be proposed to DAO members. 

It is up to individual members to decide if he/she wants to invest personal time/resource/money in what is being proposed by DAO ‎<This message was edited>

[11/14/23, 6:42:26 AM] Gary Teh: This is a list I have compiled for the bay area

[11/14/23, 6:59:12 AM] Gary Teh: For *packaged cacao nibs*

Retail price USD12
Discounted USd10
[11/14/23, 7:00:12 AM] Gary Teh: For *bulk unpackaged*

*USD30.66* per kg is the minimum that is our cost plus DAO and investor markup
[11/14/23, 7:00:23 AM] Gary Teh: Shipping cost is not included in both cases
[11/14/23, 11:47:42 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 when you get the chance could you help check how much we owe Graziela for customs brokerage work SeaCoastLogistics for handling our import 

Once we know that figure as well as how much we owe US customs we will be able to float our second syndicate financing agreement for fiat investors to come in to provide the liquidity to finance this shipment

*Figures we need to know* before we can float the next round of financing agreement 

- amount owing US customs 

- amount owing Customs broker

- amount owing kitchen ‎<This message was edited>

[11/14/23, 1:14:08 PM] Gary Teh: Very cool! 🤩👊

Perhaps I will pop by with Jason and pick up the cargo and drop it off over at your warehousing on Thursday 

That way on Friday morning we do not need to get bogged down by the complications of dealing with the customs and then rushing over to the kitchen ‎<This message was edited>
[11/14/23, 1:32:57 PM] Gary Teh: Analyzing the critical paths for our operations happening on 16th, the more buffer we can build into each step the less likely disruption at one step will cause disruption to another step

https://www.projectmanager.com/guides/pert-chart

When we go down this route, you will need to handle the route for Edge and Node as an independent thread

While me and Jason handle the independent thread of dealing with the customs and any complications that might arise ‎<This message was edited>
[11/14/23, 2:53:40 PM] Val Lapidus: I was thinking more along the lines of not having to load and unload multiple times.  We get it from the airport in the morning and then take it right away to the kitchen

He lives in San mateo 

It doesn’t make sense for him to drive to San Francisco and then drive back to the airport 

When I look at the size of boxes I doubt it is going to fit 2 cars

[11/15/23, 11:50:57 AM] Val Lapidus: we may need after we are done packaging to deliver it to my house
[11/15/23, 11:58:35 AM] Gary Teh: Ok. Worst case scenario if we can’t do it all in one shot at least someone to stand guard over our cargo while the rest are doing the transporting 🤣

My assumption is once we unload the cargo from the warehouse the airport staff don’t want us going in an out anymore

If required in the future, @5511982667030 can withdraw money from that card and then transfer it to Coopercabruca via Pix

[11/17/23, 6:34:29 PM] Gary Teh: *Spent 30 minutes* FaceTime with @5511982667030 clearing up the confusion

@5511982667030 has my Wells Fargo credit card 

@5511982667030 also has R$500 under her management 

For expected payments these three weeks, She can pay from the R$500 under management

If expenses goes beyond R$500 that she has with her right now, she can withdraw money using my credit card at one of their local banks’ ATM 

This way is much cheaper to pay for smaller amounts of expenses incurred in Brazil (less than USD1000) than paying via International Wire transfer

*This is just an interim solution*

I am not expecting any large payments to Brazil side till end of the year. 

If need does arise that we pay for items above USD1000 before year end, it is recommended we do wireless transfer via USA bank 

In the future, beyond the end of this year, if our sales and marketing efforts in USA and Europe is successful and we believe there is a foreseeable need to make constant payments to Brazil suppliers, I will personally fly into Brazil and setup for a dedicated digital bank account and hook it up with PIX.

that way we can make future payments to suppliers in Brazil directly via PIX. Via this route we will not have to incur international bank transfer cost ‎<This message was edited>

[11/20/23, 9:20:21 PM] Gary Teh: Feels I should probably infiltrate the kitchens of the *Vipassana meditation centers* after this as well as all the other meditation centers in California 

 https://www.dharma.org/

https://www.esalen.org/

https://ratnaling.org/

https://www.spiritrock.org/

With the exception of Vipassana which is donation based all the other meditation centers charge their clientele a crazy sum just to attend their retreats
[11/20/23, 9:20:22 PM] Gary Teh: This one based in India charges their clients a fortune

[11/20/23, 9:23:22 PM] Anupa/diya: Osho is huge in India and internationally. It's as big as the art of living. I don't think they are hugely on charity..osho is like more of a philosophy
[11/20/23, 9:24:09 PM] Anupa/diya: It's one of the most popular retreats as sathguru and art of living
[11/20/23, 9:25:06 PM] Anupa/diya: I have a friend who frequently does vipassanna in India.  I can put you in touch

[11/21/23, 10:48:46 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 thank you very much for your contribution helping us get pass our first critical milestone (100kg from Brazil to USA)

As discussed and agreed upon, inviting you out of our guild 

@16468233438 will be the primary interface between Brazil and USA moving forward 

We now focus on setting up our second trade route  (Brazil to Europe) @41799155602 will be the key person in charge on the European side 🙂🙏

[11/22/23, 3:25:43 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 This is the mailer I used 

https://www.dollartree.com/peel-seal-kraft-paper-envelopes-5-ct/361746



*_Key constrains*_
When combined with shipping labels from stamps.com, total shipping and material cost will be under *_USD6.50*_ which is what we are currently charging for shipping within USA. 

To stay under this cost each package shipped out must be under *_9 ounce*_ to stick to that shipping price 

Also packaging and mailer materials *must not contain plastic* otherwise our brand story of saving the rainforest totally falls apart, which means we will need to totally scrape the story that we are saving the rainforest and tell a totally different brand story for Agroverse. Right now I don’t even know what other compelling story to tell other than this one. 



*Worst case scenario analysis*
if our brand story doesn’t work and nothing sells, we will just donate our entire inventory to GoodWill during *Christmas 2024* and scrape the project. Since expiry date is within a year, we can’t sell it beyond *17th 2024* 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

Yes. 

There are a few of them left in the same box you found the USPS thick envelope you used today 

Dig through the box you will find them at the bottom

Plus they are very very light so doesn’t add to the shipping cost that we incur during fulfillment ‎<This message was edited>

We need to showcase the social and env impact while exhibiting our product: characteristics, packaging, etc…
[11/24/23, 5:37:48 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=241235

Write up by US government on the cabruca system and challenge farmers face due to low income/hectare.

increasing number of these land turning into pasture land (or chop down trees and grow soy beans) when farmers give up thereby adding to global warming ‎<This message was edited>
[11/24/23, 5:38:41 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.truesight.me/agroverse

There is the link to the white paper on this page which talks about how our model aims to help the farmers using the cabruca method

This is achieved through reconfiguration of supply chain so they get paid 34% instead of the original 6% from the revenue proceeds of choclate sale ‎<This message was edited>

[11/28/23, 12:36:14 PM] Gary Teh: Seems this _article_ as well as our _bag of cacao nibs_ sitting at the kitchen counter came in really handy for storytelling purposes 

Today is the off day for the entire community at the zen center

Randomly bumped into the manager in charge of procuring all the food supplies for the zen kitchen

She gave me an in-depth dive of the _user psychology_ when it comes to stocking their kitchen and how their supply chain works.

She loved the *_story of saving the rainforest*_  as well as the *_earthy design of the package*_ so much, she has offered to help setup an appointment with the *_procurement manager*_ of their Whole Foods supplier. Once we establish a relationship with the _*procurement manager_*, the hope is that they will start buying our cacao nibs in bulk

Also she has offered to drive me over to meet the _*procurement manager*_ once the Whole Foods retailer responses

She also mentioned that the zen center is geographically situated right at the heart of where our target demographic is located 

The universe is very visibly self aligning. 🤩🙏

https://veritablevegetable.com/grower/

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

[11/29/23, 4:43:35 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 what orders have there been?
[11/29/23, 4:44:15 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 did you know that we have to mark orders as shipped on Amazon? I got an email from Amazon for the item that I purchased that because it hasn't been shipped. My credit card wasn't charged
[11/29/23, 8:00:51 PM] Anupa/diya: Hi Val
[11/29/23, 8:01:13 PM] Anupa/diya: I had no idea that things had to be marked.
[11/29/23, 8:02:07 PM] Anupa/diya: I am not looking into orders anymore. I was looking into the Amazon issue which I believe is solved. I have way too much on my plate now to look into sales.

[12/1/23, 8:02:46 AM] Vlatko Gigov: heya Val, i’ve received only 3kg directly from Brazil. I dont have the actual agroverse product. and thats what I need.
[12/1/23, 8:03:18 AM] Vlatko Gigov: i need only the packaging with labels to then fill them in with what I have.
[12/1/23, 8:05:53 AM] Gary Teh: I was going to pass @41799155602 the packaging when I arrive in Switzerland 

But if he is able to get it before I arrive then less weigh in my backpack 🙂🙏

[12/1/23, 4:02:39 PM] Gary Teh: Which by service provider and package did you use for @41799155602?

There is one that just cost USD21 for worldwide for each 8 ounce bag 

Please use that one next time
[12/1/23, 4:03:55 PM] Gary Teh: Also which one did you use for @19209806391 

USPS provider should be charging maximum USd6.50 for each 8 ounce bag
[12/1/23, 4:04:26 PM] Val Lapidus: It turns out that both packages were supposed to go via UPS instead of USPS.  So I'm going to go home and figure out if there is a $21 option and canceled this 100 option
[12/1/23, 4:04:47 PM] Gary Teh: Yes please.

[12/1/23, 4:17:23 PM] Val Lapidus: ok, for some reason it didn’t give me the option to select USPS as a carrier when i tried originaly
[12/1/23, 4:18:48 PM] Val Lapidus: deleted message as it had vladko’s personal address
[12/1/23, 4:23:41 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 i’ve requested refunds for both items and am redoing the lables
[12/1/23, 8:43:10 PM] Gary Teh: What were the contents shipped to Vlatko? 

That way I can gauge what else to bring him when I arrive in Switzerland 

Also know how to update *_ledger for AGL2*_
[12/1/23, 8:43:46 PM] Val Lapidus: 8 empty 8oz labeled packs
[12/1/23, 8:47:12 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602

Are you planning to sell these 8 bags or giving out as samples to prospective distributors?

If distributing them out to prospective distributors, then cost of cacao nibs and freighting should be deducted from *_OffChain ledger and borne by DAO*_

If planning to sell to buyers than the total cost and DAO based standard markup will be charged via *_invoice issued*_

Let me know which is which ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/23, 8:47:36 PM] Val Lapidus: He said he was going to go show the packaging to the potential buyers. He's not selling it
[12/1/23, 9:00:53 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. Charge to DAO off chain balance
[12/1/23, 9:01:12 PM] Gary Teh: What did @19209806391 mentioned he would use the 18 ounces of cacao nibs for?
[12/1/23, 10:34:50 PM] Val Lapidus: He is bringing it as samples to sales meetings
[12/2/23, 4:28:00 AM] Gary Teh: Ok charge to DAO off chain balance then 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 6:33:13 AM] Vlatko Gigov: correct.
[12/2/23, 6:34:12 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 how is it going? When do you have time today or tomorrow to assist with the deck prep?
[12/2/23, 6:37:59 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Do we have any info what we have sold so far from the ~100 kg? In units and quantity? 

What are the next quantities envisaged to be ordered for the US market? 

Will price per kg drop if we increase quantities?
[12/2/23, 6:42:59 AM] Val Lapidus: 1x12.5 kg sold
And 2x8oz sold
[12/2/23, 6:43:35 AM] Val Lapidus: No order plans at the moment
[12/2/23, 6:44:13 AM] Val Lapidus: Yes price should drop with volume
[12/2/23, 6:44:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s maybe have these numbers so we can plan appropriately.
[12/2/23, 6:46:41 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @16468233438 I know you have opened the sales rep commissions discussions. I believe it’s a necessary carrot if we want to have a Herbalife style decentralized sales force. I’m opening up the discussions here first as it pertains to this current business model and the once we have flushed out few options we can put it up for voting in the town hall.
[12/2/23, 6:47:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Are u asking pricing for Switzerland?
[12/2/23, 6:48:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: It will be good to form prices based on quantities and geography. We must have this info in the deck for Monday.
[12/2/23, 6:49:57 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think has the full picture of the supply chain cists
[12/2/23, 7:18:14 AM] Gary Teh: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WPO0BwfRnDG-AKV3949Nqa8yWmgRzX3JtF-Sw3E49-0/edit
[12/2/23, 8:22:44 AM] Gary Teh: It’s all here for USA

Excluding DAO and financiers markup which is based on standard rate

[12/2/23, 8:25:32 AM] Gary Teh: For cost of Brazil to Switzerland supply chain

you can calculate based on receipts submitted by Orlantildes 

Exact exchange rate charged by bank and fees are not evident yet

Fatima has yet made withdrawal from the OffChain USD balance maintained in my personal bank account
[12/2/23, 8:40:24 AM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 I have asked our Brazilian supplier what type of price discounts there are when we order in larger quantities like 500 kilos or 1000 kilos I Will let you know when he responds
[12/2/23, 9:12:15 AM] Val Lapidus: @Val, we are going through a moment of high volatility in the price of almonds and you can follow this on the website investing.com. This year cocoa has already increased by approximately 70% and continues to increase.
Despite this, we can, yes, grant a discount for larger volumes.
Next week I will send our portfolio valid for the month of December here in the group. Every beginning of the month I will send you a new portfolio.
[12/2/23, 9:49:34 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Ok. Thanks. We need to be exact in forming prices and account for rising costs. The more current and anticipatory info the better.
[12/2/23, 9:50:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 let me know about tomorrow. It’s important we dial in the deck.
[12/2/23, 9:50:43 AM] Val Lapidus: I don't know if there's a futures market for accountants, but you could look at leaps if there are and see what they're prising. Pretend
[12/2/23, 9:51:07 AM] Val Lapidus: Accountants I mean cacao nibs
[12/2/23, 9:54:21 AM] Vlatko Gigov: There is, but that’s at bulk. We are not there yet :)
[12/2/23, 9:54:36 AM] Vlatko Gigov: We can do hedge the min quantity we commit to purchase ‎<This message was edited>

[12/2/23, 11:35:07 AM] Rodney Wieck: Yes, that is correct Val
[12/2/23, 12:21:09 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Of Course, otherwise why are we disintegrating the supply (value) chain. Please don’t think that the ppl in this org are only capitalists…
[12/2/23, 1:00:00 PM] Gary Teh: The most equitable approach would be for the commission pay out to be done fully in TDG only. 

People who wants to cash out their TDG for fiat needs to go exchange them at official venues 

Having a component in our comps that pays out Fiat directly to participants undertaking any DAO related activity also sends out a *_very negative signal*_ to people familiar with cryptocurrency tokenomics 

When I studied the tokenomics presented to me by Nio in Dubai (_*who does pump and dump professionally*_) that is usually the back door he uses to drain the fiat from any tokenomics system he comes up with

And that is exactly how Ethan did it for his project wonderhero, another mainland Chinese enabled *_pump and dump scheme*_ that took place in Singapore ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 1:02:17 PM] Gary Teh: I am open for the commission payout to be done in TDG 

And also for the commission payout formula that includes *_sales figure secured_* and *_DAO standard rate*_

Folks who are keen to crack their brains at it please feel free to surface some formula for consideration 

And then have the formula submitted in our @120363111951279022@g.us for voting 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 1:02:27 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Who is neo? Another Chinese induced capitalist scam.
[12/2/23, 1:02:54 PM] Val Lapidus: 1.  I agree tdg tokens as commission payment.
2.
[12/2/23, 1:03:00 PM] Vlatko Gigov: It’s not about what you are open
[12/2/23, 1:03:10 PM] Vlatko Gigov: It’s about what the value chain pertains
[12/2/23, 1:03:28 PM] Vlatko Gigov: We are not here to deal with your sentiment.
[12/2/23, 1:03:46 PM] Vlatko Gigov: WE ARE HERE TO DISINTEGRATE THE VALUE CHAIN
[12/2/23, 1:03:49 PM] Gary Teh: We are here to deal with everybody’s sentiment via voting 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 1:04:01 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Nope

[12/2/23, 1:04:30 PM] Gary Teh: When we have consensus about how we can operate together then there is disruption 

Otherwise don’t expect any action

[12/2/23, 1:07:09 PM] Vlatko Gigov: We are here only to disintegrate
[12/2/23, 1:07:49 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 👆
[12/2/23, 1:09:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: maybe I’m wrong
[12/2/23, 1:10:32 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to point out that the margins on the possible commissions are not all that high. Because our price is already high and compared to other vendors, we need to be able to stay competitive while also offering a feel good story.  And one more point, there's no reason that those of us that are in developing countries can't do sales in the US or for that matter. Any territory where we can import the product into and collect on those commissions.  I think with a decent internet connection, you can make phone calls into the US. Find vendors that you want to send the sample to communicate with those vendors, get their address where to send their sample and then ask me to send out the sample.
[12/2/23, 1:11:33 PM] Val Lapidus: Everyone in this DAO can become part of the go-to market, and sell the product
[12/2/23, 1:11:39 PM] Val Lapidus: And earn commission
[12/2/23, 1:25:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with you @16468233438
[12/2/23, 1:26:32 PM] Vlatko Gigov: So let’s map out the whole process in a nice % and value based timeline to get everyone accounted for
[12/2/23, 1:26:55 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Calling for an epistemological exercice in this inner circle
[12/2/23, 1:27:10 PM] Vlatko Gigov: D DAO is all about definitions.
[12/2/23, 1:28:43 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Maybe this is how we solve for inflation. Or maybe I am a communist
[12/2/23, 3:09:25 PM] Gary Teh: *Parts required*

1) verbal script that any DAO member can follow when telling Agroverse story 

2) a protocol which they can follow in DAO to work the script
[12/3/23, 4:49:07 AM] Gary Teh: For verbal script if someone want to come  up with an initial draft that has been tested to work, that would be great.

We can then modify this shared script as we use it to iterate with prospective buyers 🙂🙏
[12/3/23, 8:07:38 AM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply
