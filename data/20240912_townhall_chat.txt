[7/30/23, 1:21:46 PM] Francois renet: Hey guys. I know I keep on jumping in and out of convos. It’s been a tough year so far
[7/30/23, 1:23:19 PM] Francois renet: As far as selling the nibs, have you thought of selling through touch of modern? That have different products everyday and I’ve seen fair trade coffee for example before. They have a huge mailing list and because there is a variety of products the open rate is pretty high. Just a quick thought!
[7/30/23, 1:38:16 PM] Gary Teh: What is touch of modern? Is it a company? 🙂
[7/30/23, 2:08:44 PM] Francois renet: It’s a website. https://www.touchofmodern.com

[7/30/23, 2:50:08 PM] Gary Teh: Starting to feel like to power some aspects of our growth engine, we will need to incentivize the adoption of our tokens amongst the keto demographic. And the natural way to do so is to allow them the ability to exchange their tokens for packages of cacao nibs at cost price instead of the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price if they paid for them using Fiat money.
[7/30/23, 2:56:05 PM] Gary Teh: Once we have our inventory ready in the warehouse, it makes sense to start discussions with them. 

Do you know someone working in the company?
[7/30/23, 2:59:11 PM] Tess walkowski: The name of the market of the man I listen to is merchant of vino
[7/30/23, 2:59:42 PM] Tess walkowski: We need a wholesale PDF ready to mail....

[7/30/23, 3:13:49 PM] Francois renet: I don’t but I can try and find someone!
[7/30/23, 3:21:01 PM] Tess walkowski: PDF is the format to email or print

Too much information here for folks that are only keen on and only have time for high level updates 🙂🙏

From what I am aware, you can't really list it directly, it needs to get picked up somehow by the folks that are affliated with the organization.

    - completed one version of focus group questions 

    - Brazilian said still sourcing for manufacturer willing to take on small batch manufacturing 

    - Ecaudor supplier still waiting for manufacturer to respond on quotation for packaging small batch

    - Ecuador supplier still waiting for their cooperatives to respond with sending samples to USA for focus group 

    - Peruvian samples for focus group arrived

    - sourced for commercial facility to self pack the cacao nibs here in the US

    - sourced for storage facility

    - coming up with some marketing materials to experiment with a B2B2C attempt here in SF
[8/1/23, 2:37:46 AM] Gary Teh: The focus group will clarify if keto diet customers prioritize cacao nibs' origin. If not, we can simplify the supply chain by sourcing from different farmers for their ESG needs. However, this may affect our presentation to the web3.0 community in our white paper.

    - received interim quotation from Brazil to print and pack 500 units of 8 ounce organic cacao nibs 

    - started executing on recruiting participants for our upcoming focus groups


Needs 
——
    - more help recruiting participants for our focus group - people who are or had used cacao nibs for their keto diet
[8/3/23, 8:34:03 AM] Barbara Sandini: Unfortunately I don’t know anyone but I’ll ask around
[8/3/23, 4:47:25 PM] Gary Teh: There are around more than 8 million keto forums out there. Probably too much time and effort for one person to really handle it in a scalable manner. 

I proposing to release funds of USD1000 from our vault to hire a data entry clerk on behalf of our DAO to plough through the top 1000 of these forums and post a message like this elicit the insights we are hoping to get

https://www.discusscooking.com/threads/calling-all-keto-nib-enthusiasts-share-your-cacao-wisdom-%F0%9F%8D%AB%F0%9F%92%AA.136762/

So it will be USD1 per forum.

After this deployment the asset in our vault will be down to USD2000.

Release USD1000 to hire data entry clerk

[8/3/23, 4:50:10 PM] Gary Teh: Bump
[8/3/23, 4:58:50 PM] Fatima: Gary, why do we need to advertise this now?

Please, calm down.

Better wait to have a good value proposition (after focus group) and than advertise.
[8/3/23, 4:59:58 PM] Gary Teh: It’s not for advertising 

It’s just gathering participants for our focus group or if they don’t come just trigger off the release of insights within the post themselves
[8/3/23, 5:01:47 PM] Fatima: Gary, we will find people.
Don’t need to spend USD1000 to hire a data entry clerk…
[8/3/23, 5:04:39 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. 

The gist of it is, I am open to utilizing USD from our vault to pay and have qualified research participants come for our focus groups. 🙂👍
[8/3/23, 5:08:38 PM] Tess walkowski: Put a head hunting fee or pay the participants of the study
[8/3/23, 5:09:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Is it that challenging to find? Just offer the keto peeps $50
[8/3/23, 5:22:27 PM] Gary Teh: Why not split the USD50 between the recruiter and the participant?

USD15 for recruiter
USD35 for participant
[8/3/23, 5:24:08 PM] Gary Teh: Since we are conducting 3 focus groups, and 6 participants for each. 

We are looking at a total of 18 participants. That USD900 

Slightly less than USD1000 budget proposed earlier.

[8/3/23, 5:49:54 PM] Tomas - Offchain: is there any online event about cacao specialists? or keto community?
[8/3/23, 5:51:20 PM] Tomas - Offchain: ship it to the next big event and get a champion to get all the feedback
[8/3/23, 5:54:47 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like USD1000 budget is sufficient enough to play around with to get the insights we needs 

What other thoughts and ideas are there to getting what we need from the focus groups??
[8/3/23, 5:54:54 PM] Tess walkowski: It's smart to maybe overbook if people don't show
[8/3/23, 5:55:15 PM] Tess walkowski: In ux class they told us to go stand outside a super market
[8/3/23, 5:55:45 PM] Tess walkowski: What worked for me was asking everyone in the youth hostel.   I got my six interviews
[8/3/23, 5:56:08 PM] Tess walkowski: I did it one by one day Rathet than a focus group

[8/3/23, 9:10:49 PM] Gary Teh: This prize money is for 100kg shipment size

Prize increases to USD300,000 when shipment size increases to 15,000KG which is the market segment saturation point in a given month. 🤔
[8/3/23, 9:16:51 PM] Gary Teh: @6590995199 I believe we can dust off the game design mechanics you came up with last year and reuse it again

[8/3/23, 11:38:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Curious. What are the answers you want answered in your focus group?
[8/3/23, 11:44:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Some of the questions you have poses in the above discussions are very relevant.  I also really recommend googles ux course.  Module 2 knocks out the concepts and approach of ux
[8/3/23, 11:45:37 PM] Tess walkowski: I got six interviews in a day at a hostel.  Sit in front of whole foods.  Find a them there!
[8/3/23, 11:46:39 PM] Tess walkowski: Too complicated.
[8/3/23, 11:46:51 PM] Tess walkowski: Also why does it have to be in person
[8/3/23, 11:47:09 PM] Tess walkowski: What about LinkedIn
[8/3/23, 11:47:48 PM] Tess walkowski: I did a poll there once 100 percent of users have paid more than $5 for a chocolate treat
[8/4/23, 1:11:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: I agree
[8/4/23, 1:11:37 AM] Kelvin Chew: Why don’t participants get nibs instead
[8/4/23, 1:11:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: Free product samples
[8/4/23, 1:12:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: So first it’s marketing
[8/4/23, 1:12:14 AM] Kelvin Chew: Second. U don’t pay money for information readily available online
[8/4/23, 1:12:50 AM] Kelvin Chew: I wanna know what questions u have that is so critical that it requires a focus group

    - Reached out to Dean about Gifting our cacao nib samples to camp Moon Drive during the upcoming Burning Man
    - Reached out to SeaCoastLogistics the partner company of OmegaService the freighting company the Brazilian cooperative is partnered with. 
    - We are clarifying what is the actual modified FSVP requirements for small importers and small producers
    - Refreshing version 1 of updated Brazilian package designs to fit to the dimensions given by their packaging company.
[8/12/23, 1:33:20 AM] Val Lapidus: Gary, any progress on qr code and website?
[8/12/23, 1:34:42 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. Nothing yet. 
QR code is easy to generate. 
Will try to start the site on Monday. Bulk of the copywriting could be done using ChatGpt since we got the gist of the content. 

Dean mentioned Mobile reception might be bad over at that place.
[8/12/23, 1:35:33 AM] Val Lapidus: I think they'll not have access to a grinder while there and will take the sample home and once they get home they can scan it the QR that is
[8/12/23, 1:36:41 AM] Gary Teh: Might just end up using Wix or Wordpress for our MVP, throw in a template insert our logo, some photos we took during our Brazil Trip or generated using Stable Diffusion AI.
[8/12/23, 1:38:46 AM] Gary Teh: You will be very surprised. There are a bunch of very very hardcore engineers in camp Moon Drive. 

Dean literally built a portable heated shower which we used there.
Carlo built a solar powered bugee which they used to drive around the playa.

Chat with Dean when we meet on Tuesday to get a sense how he is planning to help spread the word.

Please do note. Just to be very very clear. Utilization of Foodlens will not be part of our initial 100KG pilot test as involves an adoption cycle that we are not prepared to undertake at this stage in our project.

    - please take a photo of the condition of the content within
    - get the quoted price from the Postal Office based the shipping configuration you usually use for shipping out your stuff and send it back to us.
[8/16/23, 9:18:51 PM] Tess walkowski: Wait you want me to send the nibs back too?
[8/16/23, 9:19:32 PM] Gary Teh: Check the cost of sending it back and let us know what it cost you 

But Don’t send it. Use the material within for your RnD
[8/16/23, 9:20:13 PM] Tess walkowski: I will ask them about the weight restrictions when I go next. I think under 8oz is $5.10 / $4.10 with the account
[8/16/23, 9:20:32 PM] Tess walkowski: If that's what it is we might want 7.7 oz packages
[8/16/23, 9:20:53 PM] Gary Teh: Please check with them once you have the package with you and let us know
[8/16/23, 9:38:47 PM] Tess walkowski: Yeah I'll go verbally ask any questions you have
[8/16/23, 9:39:33 PM] Tess walkowski: I have all the prepaid flat rates in my car too

[8/16/23, 11:47:52 PM] Tess walkowski: The actual boxes but flat rate is expensive $11 small box

Then figure out how to help other people following keto diet quickly onboard on to the same set of behavioral patterns

[8/18/23, 9:18:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Has that cacao bean been roasted? Before being broken into nibs?
[8/18/23, 9:19:14 PM] Tess walkowski: It's not roasted right?
[8/18/23, 9:22:12 PM] Gary Teh: It’s roasted already
[8/18/23, 9:22:31 PM] Gary Teh: Then and only then broken into nibs
[8/18/23, 9:22:45 PM] Tess walkowski: ....de Peru....?
[8/18/23, 9:22:49 PM] Gary Teh: Brazil
[8/18/23, 9:23:16 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! It arrived in two days
[8/18/23, 9:24:05 PM] Gary Teh: Let us know what stood out about this sample versus the ones you had before
[8/18/23, 9:26:30 PM] Tess walkowski: ...I haven't had nibs often...
[8/18/23, 9:26:46 PM] Tess walkowski: I am gonna crush a bean from my other to compare
[8/18/23, 9:26:58 PM] Tess walkowski: It arrived quick.
[8/18/23, 9:27:20 PM] Tess walkowski: I'm gonna taste it again.  I also don't have a comparison.
[8/18/23, 9:27:38 PM] Tess walkowski: There is something in the smell and I'm trying hard to place it
[8/18/23, 9:33:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: The label does not. Look like it’s a premium product.
[8/18/23, 9:33:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Does not look like*
[8/18/23, 9:39:34 PM] Tess walkowski: The label wore off in transit
[8/18/23, 9:39:44 PM] Tess walkowski: It looks worn or aged.
[8/18/23, 9:40:00 PM] Tess walkowski: There is an astringent note
[8/18/23, 9:40:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is why asked if it was raw
[8/18/23, 9:40:35 PM] Tess walkowski: I thought maybe roasting would sweeten
[8/18/23, 9:41:03 PM] Tess walkowski: There is something on the nose and less in the taste and I don't smell it on my criolla
[8/18/23, 9:41:55 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll get some saltines crush a bean, and do all three and then a heat test
[8/18/23, 10:01:19 PM] Gary Teh: Let us know how you eventually consumed it and if you ended up consuming the whole pack or left it somewhere
[8/18/23, 10:02:10 PM] Tess walkowski: I wanna grind it and try it sweetened
[8/18/23, 10:02:23 PM] Tess walkowski: And I can experiment on body cream.
[8/18/23, 10:02:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll retest tomorrow
[8/18/23, 10:02:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Honestly, concerned something is maybe off, but I haven't had all nibs
‎[8/18/23, 10:03:11 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎image omitted
[8/18/23, 10:03:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Inhales nibs to try to explain.
[8/18/23, 10:03:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I ate a few
[8/18/23, 10:03:45 PM] Tess walkowski: The taste that I smell it's not in every nib
[8/18/23, 10:04:21 PM] Tess walkowski: I have another roasted bean so I'll crack and bag, it could just be how the beans are
[8/18/23, 10:04:41 PM] Tess walkowski: Some nibs are more bitter
[8/18/23, 10:39:10 PM] Gary Teh: Or even the fermentation process
[8/18/23, 10:55:23 PM] Gary Teh: Could you help check with your contact in Colombia what their post harvesting process is?
[8/18/23, 11:10:07 PM] Tess walkowski: That's like apples to oranges 😀
[8/18/23, 11:10:45 PM] Tess walkowski: When we press it it comes out a paste..... I sent you a video long ago showing that
[8/18/23, 11:11:36 PM] Tess walkowski: They ferment them in trays
[8/18/23, 11:11:59 PM] Tess walkowski: And roast them in cast iron pots on an open fire....lightly
[8/18/23, 11:16:34 PM] Tess walkowski: And then we put them in a meat grinder
[8/18/23, 11:17:02 PM] Tess walkowski: I paid about $20 kilo for criolla.
[8/18/23, 11:20:21 PM] Tess walkowski: https://www.nowfoods.com/
[8/18/23, 11:20:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Now distributes to whole foods.   Compare to a product like that

[8/19/23, 11:41:42 AM] Gary Teh: Templates for qualifying future farming cooperatives will be generated and made available here 

https://GitHub.com/truesightdao/fda_fsvp

DAO members will be able to utilize the templates therein to start the verification process for their farmer friend’s facilities

Actual qualification for importing for sale into the USA market will be done by the Qualified individual in our DAO.
[8/19/23, 11:46:51 AM] Gary Teh: I believe the business model of DnB.com makes a lot of sense. 

All records awaiting for qualification will be put into a queue to be processed at the rate according to FSPCA Qualified Individual discretion (highly dependent on available bandwidth)

For records to be put in the expedited queue, there will be charge of DAO governance tokens.  Let’s use the market rates we have uncovered so far. 

    - 3000TDG for small scale farmers

    - 6000TDG for normal sized businesses

As mentioned before to avoid incurring of unnecessary server infrastructure cost, ratification by qualified individual will be done on public blockchain like Ethereum using smart the contract that will be drafted by our DAO when we get to that stage.

We are planning to have a debrief session tomorrow. This session will impact three things 


    - filter for sourcing
    - choice of packaging
    - supply chain configuration
[8/20/23, 10:41:05 PM] Anupa/diya: This is great. Did you guys manage to document with photos
[8/20/23, 11:44:43 PM] Gary Teh: Not much.

[8/20/23, 11:47:50 PM] Gary Teh: All of the folks who ended up coming via meetup.com were tree huggers 

They were really really impressed by the premium packaging but preferred the brown paper looking Kraft pouch packaging as it felt earthier and made they feel more connected to the farmers which was more aligned with our brand story

[8/21/23, 9:35:03 PM] Gary Teh: Finished our 30 minutes facetime session between @16468233438 @5511982667030 and myself. 

*Verdict*
    - we will import the 100KG raw from Brazil, rent a certified kitchen here in Bay Area and package the initial 100KG
    - @16468233438 will continue to run focus groups using the 6 samples even after I leave for Brazil to collect enough data on which taste to lock in on
    - I will passing the winning sample over to the President of the Brazilian Cooperative to lock down the taste to be delivered
    - I will attempt to pay a visit to another cooperative right in the Brazilian Amazon region to source for more cacao nibs
[8/21/23, 9:37:13 PM] Gary Teh: *Key updates for the day*

    - Did a walk through of the version of agroverse website that @918017107841 has worked on. Trying to figure out how to merge these two. Wix is not making it easy
    - Conducted an outdoor photo shoot of our product by the beach
    - Updated the official agroverse.shop to attempt at incorporating some of the elements that @918017107841 has created
    - Locked down the supply chain configuration we will be utilizing for this initial 100KG (Shipped from Brazil. Packaged in USA)
[8/21/23, 10:54:09 PM] Gary Teh: By the way please note that we have started tokenizing the use of @16468233438 space as office and RnD kitchen 

Tokenization will be at the rate similar to Hanahaus co-working space in Palo Alto which charges USD4 per person per hour

[8/22/23, 6:03:45 PM] Gary Teh: Finished one hour discussion with Danielle Sunberg

*Key take aways*
    - Consider incorporating as B-Corp
    - Consider listing on alternative market places to Amazon that are SDG focused
    - Gave a high level on expected protocol when interacting with local grocery store chains
    - Proposed brand story: simple no-brainer way of consuming food in a healthy sustainable manner

*Follow ups*
    - Introduction to alternative markets she is advising for
    - To be introduced to her husband who recently created a DAO to purchase one of the baseball teams here in the USA
    - Get a deck produced
    - To be introduced to head of health and wellness division in Wholefoods
[8/22/23, 6:04:36 PM] Tomas - Offchain: since packaging is a low proto solution i would rather use a cacao field for the landing
[8/22/23, 6:14:22 PM] Gary Teh: *B-Corp* is becoming a very strong signal within our DAO's ecosystem. 3 occurrences of it within the past 7 days

    - Shadi
    - Ambarish
    - Daniell Sunberg

*follow up in mind*
    - Follow up with Shadi on this once he finishes helping us setup our main DAO's website. He has had experience setting it up. Meeting with him this coming Thursday to do a walk through of the site he is working on that @918017107841 designed
    - Follow up with Casey (CEO of Disconnect Inc) I remember when I was still working in that company there were conversations around setting up it as a B-Corp. And they did eventually went that way

    - inform Brazil we will just buy unpackaged cacao nibs directly from the farming cooperative. 

    - We will package the cacao nibs here in USA

    - We will provide a sample, most popular variant based on taste testing outcome. Let’s try to match to that
[8/24/23, 2:23:59 PM] Gary Teh: Just completed 15 minutes face time meeting with Shadi for our Main DAO's website. Implementation work should be fully completed by today

*Follow up actions*
    - Create hosting account where Shadi can upload his work

[8/26/23, 1:11:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Actually I think that's the correct idea too when they are mixed u can't recycle at all so hard
[8/26/23, 1:16:50 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. Hans Martin and the folks working on the ski equipment industry surfaced the same problem as well when we met up those two times in Davos. 

The original idea Hans Martin posited was to transition their supply chain to a circular economy and then tokenize the individual components. 

Unfortunately, after meeting up for two times months apart I figured that supply chain is very slow moving behemoth with lots of parts that required manufacturing. 

And that was when @971561302188 reached out with the problem of poverty in Africa. Her prompt inspired looking into applying the circular economy and tokenization to a supply chain that has less parts that required manufacturing 

A few months later@13134136108 jumped in with her fanatic love for cacao which tilted the direction for us to land on that produce during our poll

And here we are today 1 years and three months after the first meeting of the ski industry folks in Davos on the cusp on bringing in our first shipment of cacao nibs from South America into USA. 

If this project does prove successful, if anyone who criticizes that the WEF (world economic forum) in Davos is just all talk and no substantial outcome could be referred to the Agroverse project which idea was in Peter there. 🤣

I figure the Switzerland Association is going to take a while to setup

I think it makes sense to utilize the OVH cloud to spin up the necessary instances to provide API interface that the mobile solutions will call to written to the chain (Ethereum or Q) 

Please let me know 🙂🙏
[8/30/23, 5:27:46 PM] Gary Teh: *additional requirements*
Farmers performing verification steps should be awarded governance tokens as their action serve to enhance the legitimacy of our network
[8/31/23, 2:00:20 AM] Suheil - Europe: Follow up on what exact matter ? What
[8/31/23, 2:04:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: Eth grants ? https://ethereum.org/en/community/grants/
[8/31/23, 2:22:25 AM] Suheil - Europe: I should get back on track anyways with Q they are waiting for us, last thing they offered a treasury on Q for us to build our governance.
I started doing it for dVillage (hospitality project)

This August was screwed for me stuck in the holy land.... hopefully will have a better more focused September month
[8/31/23, 2:22:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: Flying Monday to Europe. Will re find civilization lol

[8/31/23, 2:47:22 PM] Gary Teh: Now that we are done with the final portion of the FSVP (foreign supplier verification program) certification it has became evident that since we will be shifting a portion of our manufacturing (cacao nibs packing) process within the borders of USA, we will need to develope a food safety plan and good manufacturing practice policy to secure those sections of our supply chain 

To develop and implement that section of our supply chain we will need to engage the service of a PCQI (Preventive Control Qualified Individual) 

there are two possible options. 

Option 1) Hire one and pay him/her to draft it up once 

Option 2) build up  in-house capabilities by getting certified ourselves 

The latter route will allow us immense maneuverability later on as we configure and reconfigure on our shore supply chains by adding more and more decentralized nodes to our onshore USA food processing/manufacturing network.  

Let’s do a poll
[8/31/23, 2:50:37 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
How shall we handle the need for a PCQI for our onshore compliance needs?
‎OPTION: Utilize a portion of the proceeds already released from our vault to hire a PCQI (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Acquire PCQI certification in house using proceeds already release from our vault (4 votes)
‎OPTION: Evangelize a new DAO member who is already PCQI certified to do it in exchange for governance tokens (0 votes)
[8/31/23, 2:51:54 PM] Gary Teh: The cheapest PCQI course to get certified  I found online was this one 

https://www.aibinternational.com/products/pcqi-online/

One way or the other we will need that certification as soon as the shipment of cacao nibs arrive in USA and we start repackaging it
[8/31/23, 3:57:11 PM] Val Lapidus: Any idea how long that course is?  I think I would be interested in taking it

There is always opportunity cost especially for people who are already generating a lot of value in other domains
[9/2/23, 1:25:07 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Individual purpose that connects with the communal objectives. Opportunity costs that match the value of belongings here.
[9/2/23, 1:26:07 PM] Gary Teh: Still too vague 

Let’s just reframe it 

Why are you still here and contributing your time to this discussion?
[9/2/23, 1:27:28 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Because I'm writing about that and the DAO itself gives me the chance to think more about this and think on viable solutions. Connects my purpose with the needs of the DAO
[9/2/23, 1:34:17 PM] Anupa/diya: There should be a third option. Who ever wants to take the project forward has the ability to do so.

I think November will be like a trial period to see how things work when Gary goes into Hybernation.
[9/2/23, 1:34:26 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @14153000019 

Is it possible for us to design systems that allow us to have longevity with or without the founder?

Can we make it an experiment?

From my observation, this is the most exemplary DAO I've been part of. 

We can fine tune things wrt responsibilities to ease the weight on your shoulders. 

If the experiment fails, we will have some learnings.
[9/2/23, 2:48:42 PM] Gary Teh: I think that would be perfect and absolutely desirable 🙂🙏
[9/2/23, 2:57:19 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Thank you. For starters, I think we will need generals and succession plans if we don't have that in place.
[9/2/23, 3:09:53 PM] Gary Teh: Those are the governors… if they decide to practice their autonomy to do their job

[9/3/23, 11:34:15 AM] Gary Teh: Come the Autumn Equinox (22nd Sep 2023), the new set of governors will be rotated into position

*Current Policy*
    - *Parameter 1 - Total number of governors*: 10
    - *Parameter 2- Tenure*: 3 months
    - *Parameter 3 - Selection criteria*: top 10 contributors for past 90 days

Let's relook into how governors are selected, discuss and then agree upon a new set of policy (3 parameters) on how new governors should be selected (elected), thereafter vote this new policy into effect in our town hall.

We can consider additional parameters on top of the 3 existing ones.

[9/4/23, 8:45:44 PM] Gary Teh: Created the first draft of Agroverse technology solutions architecture. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.n1zi2ph05oau

As well as a more detailed documentation of the API end points that will be exposed via our server clusters (perhaps ran in our SunMint off-grid data center)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.ftxgqr5vdhij

Farmers/manufacturers are paid tokens whenever they conduct preventive control verification activities on chain. The value of these tokens will be backed by the profit from sales of their product in USA. 

This is even for farmers who we are not yet getting supplies from. Their adoption of the solution will just make it super easy for us to onboard them as foreign suppliers as they will become compliant with FSVP requirements as soon as they adopt our solution. This means we don't need to jump through as many hoops onboarding them.

PS: regarding the SunMint off grid data center, me and @16468233438 (perhaps Dean who built solar powered buggies for Burning Man) will experiment with implementing a fully solar powered prototype in @16468233438's backyard once I get back to California.

Once we have gotten FSVP compliance written assurance letter from the agriculture cooperative as well as proven the viability of our go to market with our very first batch of cacao nib sales we will compile the materials required to assemble a fundraising deck. We will approach the Ethereum foundation as well as social impact funds for financing to accelerate the build out of the prototype documented.

        - how will fiat generated via the operations of the project be channeled back to boost the value of governance tokens issued in support of that project.

[9/7/23, 1:11:49 PM] Gary Teh: Too many stuff packed into the agenda those few days and too little time in between to figure out the transit 

If you have noticed by now the transit is actually more complicated than realized. Even their online booking website was really hard to use

Bulk of what was priorly planned fell through today.

    - Verma has surfaced Refi (Regenerative finance) as a new Web3 domain. This differs from Defi (Decentralized finance) because as its purely focused on financing environmentally regenerative projects

*Follow ups*
    - Verma has sent link to 2 related Refi projects that we could follow up with
        - https://ethereum.org/en/refi/ (for financing)
        - https://toucan.earth/ (DAO focus on Amazon region)

[9/8/23, 6:26:19 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Would it make more sense use agroverse cacao to manufactre a different product to add more value?
[9/8/23, 7:00:55 PM] Gary Teh: Later on. Too complicated a supply chain to manage right now 

Nutrition labeling for FDA compliance is going to be a nightmare 

We make money first selling cacao nibs and then invest in new product RnD later
[9/8/23, 7:02:14 PM] Tomas - Offchain: i found a use case in argentina were they use cacao but wanted to be sure before using time on that
[9/8/23, 7:02:15 PM] Tomas - Offchain: ok
[9/8/23, 7:13:02 PM] Gary Teh: If you could send some samples to the USA 

We could do a focus group to test market receptiveness 

If overall positive, then we will do
    - lab test
    - nutrition panel design 
    - …. The whole nine yards 

It’s too much capital outlay for now. We don’t have that much capital to splash all over the place 

We recoup our capital outlay with sales first before looking at further rnd on the product side

Rather than allowing V directly into our ecosystem, he was kept in a holding bay 

He was only allowed entry into our beer hall after we have had an interview with him and ascertained he is of value to our DAO 

Only then was he allowed into our beer hall

At which point he had already made some contributions to our DAO

I propose we roll out this new protocol for a new DaO member onboarding

You can find information on the podcast here: https://inatba.org/podcast-series-on-refi-and-financial-inclusion/

If interested please let me know how your project is contributing to ReFi/Financial inclusion then we can develop questions from there. "

“Agroverse promotes regenerative finance by connecting sustainable farmers with global markets, fostering economic growth in underserved regions, and ensuring fair compensation for eco-conscious practices. Through blockchain technology, it creates transparent and ethical financial systems, aligning profit with environmental and social benefits.”
[9/10/23, 10:32:18 AM] Suheil - Europe: starting to play around --> https://www.instagram.com/p/CxA03YkMXP2/ 

to be continued... 

Meanwhile, we need dao members to follow and like the Instagram page. 

Any members who is "IN" in being engaged to help us push organic (by giving us couple of minutes of their time to share/like/comment social posts) please raise your hand

example of organic trick : 
- imagine the results if, for this post ,we tag like X amount  of members and each re share from their profile.

If u cant imagine, i can tell you from experience , results come in BIG :)
[9/10/23, 10:42:21 AM] Suheil - Europe: Target: 
- 3/4 posts,stories, reels  a week 
- 1-2 interviews a week ( with farmers, dao members etc..)

We might need to open a specialized guild for PR and marketing as coordination and consistency is one of the most critical points for successful long-term goals... 

it is not about making Instagram posts only. 

we need to plan: podcasts, social strategies, mini documentaries, press, a lot of production involved... unfortunately this part is not doable in a "decentralized manner"  and we need to act like a traditional company team with same level of commitment :)

@14152693276 mentioned she will not be in the office before that so she will link you up with her assistant who oversees administrative matters there 🙂🙏
[9/11/23, 11:16:02 PM] Gary Teh: Had a 60 minutes FaceTime with @5511982667030 

*key outcomes of discussion*

    - Wednesday session with president of Coopercabruca lock down steps in written assurance letter 

     - for each step in the written assurance letter, specify a day during this period here in Bahia to visit each site to ascertain they are exactly as defined 

    - have Orlantildes sign the written assurance letter after full inspection is completed

    - make photocopies of each certificate that Orlantildes has that is relevant for written assurance letter 

    - establish FSVP record for each inspection session we conducted 

    - Conduct a blind test with Orlantildes using the six samples to sync up the terminologies we use to communicate the taste for future

    - pass six numbered samples to Orlantildes for future communication purposes

    - ask orlantildes to arrange for me to attend a cacao ceremony led by MaiLan here in Bahia

    - communicate with Orlantildes that if needed Lucia will be our legal counsel here in Bahia to check through the paperwork we have compiled
[9/11/23, 11:19:37 PM] Gary Teh: Completed 1 hour dinner appointment with Lucia this evening. She is a Prospective legal counsel in Bahia 

*key outputs*

    - if required she will interface with the federal police her for legal matters. Her brother was the chief of the federal police office branch

    - her profession is law by training 

    - gave advice not to setup company first. 

    - Important to identify local that could be trusted with management of funds. 

    - Brazilian law requires deployment of USd100k for setting up local entity

[9/12/23, 12:50:17 PM] Gary Teh: Scheduled a meeting with Derrek from the engineering guild and @31641075825 to chat this coming Friday

*Scope of discussion*
    1. - train ChatGpt with our historical data recorded on our ledger
    2. - streamline our ledger update by automating the classification of incoming DAO member contributions
    3. - expected output of this standalone initiative
    
*Purpose*
    1. mitigate against trigger of unofficial KILL SWITCH in the event no one knows up to update the ledger anymore after Gary gets KIA (killed in action) during one of our DAO quests by being shot with a gun or stabbed with a proper knife.

    2. replace human and have AI as the independent unbiased judge

    3. further the manifesto of the Do Nothing society.

[9/12/23, 10:30:26 PM] Gary Teh: At this point, since we are a DAO (everyone has governance voting rights) , let’s invite some thoughts on the table to discuss about possible action plan moving forward given this new set of information

Thereafter we add/adjust/remove milestone items on the Agroverse whitepaper

[9/13/23, 12:03:45 AM] Val Lapidus: So the only thing that changes from our original plan is that we aren't paying the co-op in DAO tokens?
[9/13/23, 12:24:02 AM] Gary Teh: Actually nothing changed at all from the current execution perspective 

We are just not going to focus our attention on building a cacao futures trading platform as some has mentioned might be an option further down the road 

One potential concern is that if all the cacao farmers pre sold their cacao on that platform we might end up not having any supplies to sell when we do ramps up our distribution effort on the USA side
[9/13/23, 12:27:42 AM] Gary Teh: Once we ramp up our US based distribution volume and when we do roll out the mobile based FSVP verification process later on, they will forced to adopt it anyways because of FDA compliance requirements

So no big deal on the adoption front
[9/13/23, 1:38:08 AM] Anupa/diya: I think that someone was me. If Mathew has said that they are partnering with another company to do the same thing . Then making two products of the same purpose is pointless.

We can maybe capitilise on it as a buy in to the agroverse community. Maybe
[9/13/23, 7:04:27 AM] Gary Teh: Please elaborate what do you mean by buy in?
[9/13/23, 2:58:02 PM] Gary Teh: Finished 5 hours of FaceTime with the cooperative members here 

*key outputs*
    - captured video footages requested by @918017107841 
    - updated and completed written assurance letter for FDA FSVP compliance 
    - conducted tasting session with cooperatives members using six samples brought. Sample #6 was strongest contestant. 

*follow up*
    - visit cacao innovation center (CIC) where independent quality assurance certification is issued 

    - visit facilities that will be processing our shipment of cacao nibs 

    - get sample of cacao nibs matching closely to taste profile of sample #6

    - arranging to attend cacao ceremony before my departure 

    - visiting sabrae office to follow up with flight ticket for @5511982667030

[9/13/23, 6:29:16 PM] Gary Teh: We got their DUNS number!! 🤩

*up next*
- Conduct final focus group with the sample they will pass us 

- register their faciiity with FDA using DUNs number 

- send them the Purchase order as soon as we are done 

- await shipment in San Francisco airport

[9/14/23, 10:43:51 AM] Gary Teh: Moving forward, since DAO is not charging for the cacao nib samples when DAO members request them from our very limited supply, we should define clearly what we will expect in return for shipping them over. 

I feel the required reciprocal action should be something that will help move Agroverse project forward. 

As @5511982667030 suggested before, every action must necessarily enable more resources and more actions within our DAO. 

Otherwise we are not being accountable and just simply depleting DAO resources without necessarily advancing our mission. 

(PS: I still feel having the Kill Switch in place is the most effective method to focus everybody’s attention on what is important)

Let’s discuss. 🙂🙏

4 new items are now blocking on our roadmap (red) 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/agroverse/progress
[9/14/23, 12:54:02 PM] Anupa/diya: I think we need a map that will show the resources we need to make profit against the DAO s treasury. We need to make predictions so we can see if we need to go to the kill switch. If so, then we should abort shortly if we cannot be sustainable. There is no point to linger. 

However, if we continue I think we should find ways of means to sustain since the efforts are immense.I feel agroverse can help gain funding and find sustainability. We can maybe only work with AgroVerse now
[9/14/23, 12:59:19 PM] Gary Teh: *TrueSight DAO*
   - governance policies for game mechanics 
    - governance tokens management

*Agroverse*
   - one of the games utilizing game mechanics of TrueSight DAO 
    - uses TrueSight DAO governance tokens to track dao member contributor 
    - generates profit to back value of governance token issues

[9/14/23, 11:04:54 PM] Gary Teh: The Zero to One problem when it comes to go to market strategies is their lack of predictability. You will only know how effective each proposed strategy is only after resources are deployed to execute the initial iteration

Even @381642051030 mentioned this during our FaceTime the last time 

In terms of fiat resources We have USD5000++
[9/14/23, 11:08:14 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time value management - kill switch - opportunity cost on micro tasking level, hold each dao member accountable for inputs and outputs. Would be a challenge to draft the methodology and automate it.

[9/14/23, 11:42:13 PM] Gary Teh: I remember having a conversation where Brian talked about the value of time prior to us raising Series A for disconnect Inc 

Prior to product market fit, You want to be as aggressive as possible time wise in the deployment of funds by ploughing through and validating your stack of hypothesis ASAP once financing becomes available and not get distracted by anything else not on the critical path. 

If all the hypothesis don’t work you know you have a dud, you can quickly free up your time and move on to more promising opportunities.
[9/14/23, 11:43:38 PM] Gary Teh: After product market fit, Reid Hoffman has his theory which he calls blitzscaling

[9/14/23, 11:45:02 PM] Gary Teh: Are you proposing that DAO members who want to continue maintaining access to our town hall stake 90% of the governance token holdings in our vault?? 🤣
[9/14/23, 11:47:25 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That could be an option and provide a tiered system for the access to the town hall
[9/14/23, 11:47:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time sensitive of course
[9/14/23, 11:48:26 PM] Vlatko Gigov: To get access to the yield generated from dao activities you need to stake min x tokens.
[9/14/23, 11:49:48 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Puts upwards pressure (buy-in) on the token value if let’s say initiatives like agroverse are successful.
[9/14/23, 11:51:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: And from there onwards you implement the tiered system based on the rubrics and different initiatives.

*key follow ups*
Item 1 - follow up with orlantildes to discuss and agree on the process we will use to control the threshold for the taste variance of cacao nibs shipped to USA once we lock down on the taste

Item 2 - get Orlantildes to make an introduction to Tasuijio whom they are working with to issue the cacao coin so that I could understand where he is planning to go with the technology. Explore how we could tap into it later on

Item 3 - research how mini premium chocolate gifts are presented in Whole Foods USA. Orlantildes gave samples of cacao coated almonds which could have market potential in USA

The 6kg is considered *property of the financiers* managed by DAO. 

Should DAO attempt to utilize any of this managed inventory for focus group purposes or recipe RnD, DAO will need to purchase the inventory from the financiers

Purchase price of inventory from the financiers will be at the rate of *cost plus standard rate markup*. 

Payment to financier can be made in fiat or governance tokens depending on the preference of the financier. Financier can exercise the right not to sell to DAO.

[9/25/23, 12:52:56 PM] Gary Teh: Outcome 3 hour FaceTime with @554888644380 

Key bottlenecks of scaling DAO 

    - information efficiency (not knowing enough for individual dao member to make an independent decision) 

    - feeling of psychological safety (fear of making the wrong decision) 

*Proposed rectification*
    - record and transcribe all conversations that ever occur within our DAO

    - feed transcriptions and chat data to LLM (AI)

    - in case of doubt, DAO member can ask LLM (AI) for clarification since it has full context if everything that is going on within DAO

[9/28/23, 3:50:19 PM] Gary Teh: I observe that new members usually feel very enthusiastic during the initial honey moon phase and would outperform in terms of contribution during the initial 90 days and sometimes end up as governors

However beyond the initial 90 day period, their enthusiasm would wane and they lost their qualifications as governors. 

To help our system select of governors who exhibit more consistency overtime, I would like to propose that during each of the quarterly seasonal rotation we pick the top 10 contributors over the past 180 days instead of the top 90 days. 

Let's submit this to a voting process and following this outcome as the new rule in the next seasonal rotation.

[10/1/23, 2:45:00 PM] Gary Teh: As we start involving members who associate high per hour value to their time in our DAO, this becomes especially important otherwise they will churn. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 2:50:46 PM] Suheil - Europe: I guess this is how it is with all engineers. The same what happened when I onboarded @15419086904  to the guild for the website. Then awoled. Then re appeared and now after 5 months we have results....
[10/1/23, 2:50:53 PM] Suheil - Europe: Maybe this is the case with all engineers hhhh
[10/1/23, 2:52:55 PM] Suheil - Europe: Or maybe engineers don't cope well with whatsaop group and only when you hit them directly... after all that's what happened with @15419086904 no? 🤷‍♂️ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 3:16:15 PM] Gary Teh: This form of hazing practice is common in the fraternity and sorority clubs in US colleagues. 

The starkest example I have gone through was the Singapore military. The very first investment required of all new recruits before the start of military boot camp was for them to shave their hair

[10/1/23, 3:16:39 PM] Suheil - Europe: We quest the tasks and simply see actions ?
[10/1/23, 3:17:22 PM] Gary Teh: Yes, even in the previous company, before we even engage the time and attention of any engineering managers to conduct the interview, the prospect was required to perform an pre-interview test.

During the interview process 5 members from the engineering team would be involved and the final person conducting the interview was the CEO to determine cultural fit. 

The hiring committee would then convene to give either the thumbs up or thumbs down. 

Now that our official first shipment is in, I feel we are on the cusp of the need to implement something like this ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 10:22:58 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 let’s bring this portion of the discussion into  @120363044542957540@g.us for further dissection
[10/1/23, 10:26:10 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't understand why we are discussing deprecating a channel, I get that their action is not cool, but it's not a reason to kill a channel.
[10/1/23, 10:54:42 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the reason is because bulk of the engineering work right now is already taking place in @120363029205885187@g.us under @15419086904 leadership

The only reason the Engineering channel was kept there (apart from legacy reasons) was because there is a potential experimental engineering undertaking that Derek (the Hero) was going to do. And it was a good idea not to clobber communications between these two projects into one channel

But since Derek has dropped out, makes a lot of sense to just drop that channel and free up slots

We will get around to that scope that Derek was going to undertake eventually but meanwhile we will just manually update our ledger. What he was going to do is not on our critical path anyways. 

I was just testing his level of commitment to our mission with a simple ask ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 11:17:17 PM] Anupa/diya: One of the main things for the website is to build an end to end experience for the DAO. There is no point for the website to function as an information site. A current or potential member has to have the ability to interact and engage once they know what the site offers.

It's been build in what the user gets 
1. Awareness 
2. Engagement 
3.Interaction

Adding the ledger and token visibility is important is a key part of the experience.

The website is moving at a much faster speed with us collectively working on it. Eventually the original trusight will be clubbed with what is being created now.
[10/1/23, 11:20:52 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Glad both you and @15419086904 are fully focused on the end to end DAO member experience 🙂🙏
[10/1/23, 11:25:08 PM] Anupa/diya: The scalability of this website should be that it should do token and proposal  management, fund dispersal etc. This is just a basic foundation and all of it has to fit together. No user is going to hop through multiple sites to carry out tasks.
[10/2/23, 12:16:02 AM] Gary Teh: I am sure @15419086904 should be able to figure those out when we get there
[10/2/23, 12:18:08 AM] Anupa/diya: For sure 😁. We should build for not only thinking about the current but to scale

As a collective strategy _ before we reach the actualization _ there are some things that individuals need to align with 

There is 
Needs and Wants
Alignment and Purpose 
Self motivation 
Self Awareness
Which eventually leads to the collective approach 

We have to be transperant about  about the fact that when someone joins this DAO, it is almost a Self initiated journey which adds to the DAO s purpose. The  incentivisation is immediate (governance tokens) but the benefit follows later (value). Every one wears a founders hat

[10/7/23, 12:11:09 PM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 and @41799155602 

For tax reporting purposes, I am thinking for the 19% cut that our DAO earns from profit generated via the sales of Agroverse cacao nibs, these should be recognized as sales and marketing expenses on the books of TrueTech Inc and paid out to the Swiss association. 

The hands of the USA government is thus prevented from touching any of the 19%. Instead the taxation is based on Swiss law instead 

If we don’t go via this route. Those 19% will end up getting booked as profit under TrueTech Inc and charged taxes by US government 

Rather than setting up a full fledge Swiss association with by laws supporting crypto currency, I would like to propose we just setup one with a bare bone version to simply hold the funds and not deal with the cryptocurrency at this early stage.

When the profit generated via the 19% cut of the profit coming in to the Swiss association becomes substantial enough for us to have funds to throw around as we wish, we can then vote for a new set of by-laws to come into effect in the Swiss association that supports cryptocurrency. 

I feel for now just a minimal odd-number directors in the association that will not block the future set of by-laws from being voted in would be fine.

In terms of directors for the new Swiss association I am thinking:

[10/7/23, 12:15:12 PM] Gary Teh: And that is how we extract our pound of flesh from all new DAO members 

Everyone who is allowed in must have sacrificed (made sacred) something before being allowed entrance 🙂🙏
[10/7/23, 2:06:45 PM] Gary Teh: Also this will help account for all the funds we deployed from our OffChain balance for tax reduction in USA jurisdiction

The Swiss Association becomes registered as a share holder of TrueTech Inc

Then every single fiat based transaction has been accounted for in one of the taxation jurisdictions 

At the end of the day the only thing governments really care about is extracting their pound of flesh ‎<This message was edited>

[10/23/23, 1:59:43 PM] Val Lapidus: I think there should be a token incentive for monetary success at venues.  I agree it is easy to get access to a venue. The difficult part is gauging the venues viability to drive future revenue and thus it should not be a matter of oh. You got us a venue.  But more so you got us a venue and this was the result. We can attribute or find ways to attribute the resulting sales bump from a venue mechanism.  Not all should be weighed equally because they are easy to get.  But more so they should be weighed on the fact that they are targeting the right audience to make purchases
[10/23/23, 2:00:16 PM] Val Lapidus: Or targeting the right audience to get us followers
[10/23/23, 2:04:06 PM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense 🤩

A tiered system then.

125TDG is the base 

I am thinking additional TDG awards for 

    - per Instagram follower acquired 
    - per $$ sales generated ‎<This message was edited>

Good morning, good morning.

Hope you & your family are healthy & happy (and I hope you’re reading this with your morning coffee NOT in the early morning😊).

Please allow me to confirm our call scheduled for today (Tues. Nov 2nd) at 10:30 AM CST.

Also, I sent a one-pager explaining a Strategy I’m pitching to ING.  It may be of interest (please forgive me if I’ve already shared it).

Best,

Mujahid

[11/3/23, 9:38:47 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through how to account for funds deployed from our off chain balance for our in real life experiment 

I believe it makes sense to establish a shareholding of TrueSight DAO on the TrueTech Inc ledger for fiat funds deployed from our OffChain balance even though TrueSight DAO is right now not even a legal entity yet 

Once the Agroverse revenue model is proven TrueSight DAO should be registered as an associated in Switzerland, shareholdings in TrueTech Inc for fiat funds deployed for in real life experiments will be recorded as owned by TrueSight DAO

Right now, these shares will be ear marked as own by a soon to be incorporated Swiss Association

Plus correct me if i am wrong, if i remember correctly agroverse was exposing itself mainly in web3 events (which is good as this is the builders side ) but i don’t recall being in an event that fits the exposure of the cacao sales or target the buyer audience? again its not my fault if my memory is bad and i will forgive myself and then i will forget about it 😂

[11/8/23, 1:35:13 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposal*
In hindsight, when me and @41799155602 conceptualized the rubric framework we have allowed *legacy propaganda* to accidentally seep into the system

The effects of this propaganda is starting to become apparent as we _scale the DAO operations_ and introduce _increasing number of different *task types*_ into our ecosystem. The result is that it becomes harder and harder for new incoming members to grasp this ever increasingly complicated mental model.

The failure @31641075825 experienced explaining this mental model to Emelin yesterday is another one of those symptoms 

I would like to propose we go back to first principles and _simplify our rubric_ to just *4 rules*

- 1 human hour = 100 TDG

- 1 USD worth of expenses paid on behalf of DAO = 1TDG

- human hour spent for task based on self reporting along with completed artifact 

- payment of expenses with USD submit receipt to channels ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 3:19:05 PM] Gary Teh: That is very true.

If it is purely capitalistic, why not just do away with the whole token system and use USD? 

At which point my sense is bulk of the system will just collapse 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/8/23, 3:19:42 PM] Val Lapidus: Because we don't have money to pay them.  We instead are paying them in shares which will eventually be worth something

[11/8/23, 3:23:00 PM] Gary Teh: Not true 

A lot of them that I brought contributed based on the believe of a better world that we are building 

Not based on making a lot money 

The money component is to ensure the system self sustains
[11/8/23, 3:23:59 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps some folks introduced into the ecosystem were under the belief of future promised of profits 

But my sense is retention is poor from that demographic ‎<This message was edited>
[11/8/23, 3:24:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Why can't it be both a better world and money in your pocket? Why is it just one or zero?
[11/8/23, 3:24:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, you're making assumptions.  I'm in this because I want a better world.  But I also want money in my pocket and I believe the two goals are not mutually exclusive
[11/8/23, 3:25:05 PM] Gary Teh: It is not zero or one

It is which is the priority
[11/8/23, 3:25:50 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't think it matters which is the priority as long as both goals are relevant to the person contributing
[11/8/23, 3:27:08 PM] Gary Teh: It actually does. From a system perspective when one parameter is prioritized versus another the system configuration changes 

That is why we are having this poll right now
[11/8/23, 3:28:25 PM] Val Lapidus: When making money is prioritized over a better world it inherently conflicts.
[11/8/23, 3:29:00 PM] Val Lapidus: So there is no question here that a better world is the priority. But this pole is about how contribution should be measured.

That said from a capitalist perspective, there is nothing preventing DAO members from hiring someone outside to cheaply perform the task in a cheaper manner (under USD100)  while themselves getting remunerated with 100TDG for getting the task completed

It acts as a forcing function for DAO members to be creative ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 4:00:24 PM] Gary Teh: One of the reasons why to have *zero or one* is because DAO eventually needs to be _smart contract based_

Constantly requiring a _subjective human judgement_ only introduces  a _bottle neck_ in the process 

So it not only hampers the transition of DAO to a _fully smart contract based_ state, it also throws in a lot of frictional against scaling the _amount of human capital_ that came be deployed per period time effectively without compromising on the *integrity* of the system

*Integrity* is one of our core values ‎<This message was edited>
[11/8/23, 4:35:10 PM] Gary Teh: In hindsight it becomes obvious why everyone is coming to me (_the accidental subjective human judge_) for judgement on how much the value of each task is  

It also reminds me of that *one principle* @5491125130580 made the last time the governors had our FaceTime hang out

_Surface one objective rule on how tokens are awarded that is self apparent and stick to it_  then the *DAO will self mobilize*. 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 11:36:00 PM] Anupa/diya: I agree with Val on this! . We have spoken about this earlier. Some tasks take longer to execute and its also the quality of work that matters and the level of experience. We can put a cap on the task as all these factors play into it. 

Colony DAO works on tokenisation of tasks. We should look at their model

[11/9/23, 3:21:10 PM] Suheil - Europe: @918017107841  i dont really understand what is this story with the website.
[11/9/23, 3:21:38 PM] Suheil - Europe: from a fully buit primary in house website that took ages to get ready suddenly back to a random wix??
[11/9/23, 3:32:23 PM] Anupa/diya: This random wix website is a stop gap till the other fully functional website is finished
[11/9/23, 3:34:03 PM] Anupa/diya: I think we should just trust the process of people working in it and follow the flow
[11/9/23, 3:34:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: agaiin thiis term “stop gap” and sentence until other fully functional is finished…. do not mean anything as :
1. base got ready and @14153000019  confirmed it here in the group and “thanked shady” publicly —> soo phase 1 obviously is ready 

Now if we neeed Moree things, we add it up to the actual one not completely delete the based…. AAs i told you in private beetween us. if you needed more specific pages and yoou cant wait for shady so then you can pop up a gap wix pages thatt youo attach on top of the main base. it a pretty simple re route liink to window page 🤷
[11/9/23, 3:35:44 PM] Suheil - Europe: a DAO is trustless when such decisions aree being voted on from dao members not just taken autonomously from couple of members between them in privaate.
[11/9/23, 3:36:09 PM] Anupa/diya: I don't think I am going to go on a public debate about this. If you wish to know about the nitty gritties about the project. It's best you set up a call with the team to make judgements which are half baked.
[11/9/23, 3:37:05 PM] Suheil - Europe: my question : 

Did this decision get voted out by at least the governors. OR the core guild specialized iin that matter??? ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/23, 3:37:35 PM] Anupa/diya: Please go ahead with what you feel fit.
[11/9/23, 3:37:57 PM] Suheil - Europe: which people i dont understand
[11/9/23, 3:41:20 PM] Anupa/diya: In that case, We should just set up an evaluation process for every step in all the functional team
[11/9/23, 3:42:36 PM] Suheil - Europe: On multiple occasions you are mentioning to me that its a gap and until website will finish.

But what you are not getting is because you did this move wiithout consulting the expert that built the website dev and that is taking care of the website so you completely lost him and there is nothing that is “getting ready” to be waiting for in the first place 🤷 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/23, 3:44:16 PM] Anupa/diya: I am really sorry to say for someone who is not even in the project and has no idea what has been going - these are pretty strong. Please do your background research.
[11/9/23, 3:46:17 PM] Suheil - Europe: if you have found other engineer working on the website then yes i am deeply sorry its not my fault information did not get to me...
[11/9/23, 3:49:26 PM] Anupa/diya: I think you have no idea to what you are saying. Please get your facts right. If you were tracking the work, there was an urgent need for the onboarding process to start. This is just to full fill that i need. If you want please bring this up with the DAO, if you have any other issues.
[11/9/23, 3:51:35 PM] Suheil - Europe: i dont have any issue. I am just informing you that if you are waiting for something code development website related matter then there is a miss understanding between you and shadi … as what i understood that first version of website got ready and for him there are zero justifications to shut it down….
[11/9/23, 3:53:54 PM] Anupa/diya: I really feel you should know more about what is going on before you charge at people without knowing what is going on completely. I am sure we are all here for the benefit to a larger cause and to something that we are all proud so lets keep it at that.
[11/9/23, 3:57:10 PM] Suheil - Europe: i did not charge you anything and i am sorry if you feel that way.
It is simple clear 
You tell me “ i am waiting for shadi to finish"
Shadi had no idea what was going on until i poked him asking why the website is down...

Hence, miss communication.

UNLESS you have other coder working it out with you and that its from that person that you are waiting newer webste…. as of shady he is not ,simple.

nothing personal just informing you about this gap and maybe u should clarify it out with shady ‎<This message was edited>

[11/14/23, 11:47:27 AM] Gary Teh: Main difference 

_*Legacy system*_ - you end up deferring to me on which category your contribution belongs to 🤣

*_New system_* - you submit how many hours your effort was and that gets tokenized 100TDG per hour. 

_*Primary similarities*_
In either case each task should not be above 5000TDG. Life goes on without me 

If it is. Break it down into smaller tasks

_*Key insights*_
A DAO member working full time for DAO 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and 4 weeks a month and 12 months per year ends up making exactly the same amount in TDG a software engineer working in Silicon Valley would in USD

So the rates are quite reasonable from my perspective. I see us all as system hackers 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/15/23, 10:07:10 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the outcome of this discussion is that I will end up spending sometime in Europe early next year as me and @41799155602 work together to setup the European section of our Agroverse supply chain network
[11/15/23, 10:21:58 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposed governance token management protocol*

The purpose of this protocol is to discourage excessive speculation on our governance tokens in the open market once it gets listed on Centralized exchanges while at the same time capitalize on market fluctuations to increased our fiat netbook value per issued governance token ratio



*_Rules_*
    - _*Rule 1*_: every quarter DAO will make provisions to increase governance tokens in circulation by 25% of what is already in circulation last day of the previous quarter. 

    - _*Rule 2*_: Full amount might not end up being circulated in the market if no exceptional price ranges present themselves 

    - _*Rule 3*_: DAO will make open market purchase as and when market value at which governance token is traded at falls below USDT net book value. 

    - _*Rule 4*_: DAO will make open market sales of governance tokens up to the total provision specified for market circulation as and when market value per token exceeds the minimal of either USDT1 or USDT net book value per token



*_Conclusion_* 
This protocol for governance token management when strictly adhered to in the long haul is anti-dilutive on nature. 

It has the effect of discouraging excessive speculation activities beyond desirable price range both on the upside and the downside 

The muting of speculative components in open market pricing of DAO governance token help curtail distractions DAO governance token holders might otherwise experience away from daily practice of Satseva

@918017107841 we should extend our website with a page that provides people with instructions on how they can transfer the USDT they receive into their bank account after they cash out 

Also perhaps a form on that page that allows people to insert their name, WhatsApp or email address and Solana wallet address they want their USDT to be transferred to once they have cashed out their governance tokens at the prevailing exchange rate

[11/17/23, 2:14:47 PM] Gary Teh: I spent time thinking about *_WHY*_ a *_chocolate artisan_* in the Agroverse network will not want to become their own importer if and when their own operations scale up

Fundamentally it boils down to fear of *_legal repercussions*_. 

Most of these folks will be mum and pop localized operations. 

If they decide to also handle importing as part of their operations if and when FDA does an audit and surface issues with the Agroverse supply chain into USA then they will be dragged into it and their mom and pop side of the business will suffer as well. 

In that regard TrueTech Inc is the *_ultimate underwriter of legal risk*_… or more specifically *_me*_. If anything ever happens regarding the Agroverse supply chain into USA, and someone needs to go to jail, that person will be me. And it will definitely not be the first time something like this happened before (_after being mistaken for being an insurgent in Xinjiang region of China_).  🤣

For a person with a more conventional domestic arrangement like someone who has a family, such an experience will be very devastating to the rest of their family members if and then one of their family members get locked up in jail. 

However in my case, everyone in the immediate family is keenly aware of this natural inclination towards *_maximized calculated risk taking*_ in my DNA hence they won’t be devasted or even surprised if and when one of these usual exceptions occur. 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/23, 2:16:05 PM] Gary Teh: The other dimension as that a *_mom and pop*_ cannot easily replicate is the decentralized nature of the DAo community which makes it exceptionally suited for sourcing in unconventional locations in the world.

[11/23/23, 2:10:21 AM] Gary Teh: *Proposal to reduce noise on WhatsApp app and increase retention rate*

I noticed that there are quite a lot of folks who have not *_clicked in to visit any of our community WhatsApp channels for more than 90 days*_

From my perspective if a community member has churned, it doesn’t make any sense to keep _spamming_ their phone with messages they are obviously no longer interested in

Also now that we are allowing people to *_submit via our community WhatsApp channels USDT cash out requests for their TDG governance tokens held*_, this seem like a great opportunity to filter out folks who have churned for various reasons while at the same time gamify retention. 

This has the side effect of also making it more likely active community members get a response when they reach out to any of the remaining community members in our channel for help as the latter folks are obviously still interested to keep updated in matters regarding our DAO and be more inclined to help than folks who have already churned. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/23/23, 10:23:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: after a quick review of all documentation , here is my analysis why we are not ready  or should not list now.

1. requires 6-8k fiat budget (after effort and discount from our lovely contact at LA token )
2. true sight eco system becomes more vulnerable to idiot hackers. (just got hacked 2 weeks ago and hackers stole only tokens that are convertible fiat , did not touch utility tokens )  hence , let’s keep the true sight token as a utility token and internal cash out /cash in control until the eco system is less vulnerable 🤷
3. listing on exchange will require heavy routine legal operations/ reporting/ declarations aka  extra costs…
[11/23/23, 10:27:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: I would lilke to request tokenize contribution of total  3 hours including: going over all documents, research and 1 zoom call with craig : listing manager at LA token

[11/23/23, 1:11:50 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, I would like to propose an amendment to this vote.  Please add a third option which is we need to start exploring other mechanisms of communication because noise is inherent to WhatsApp.  We need channels for different topics within each guild.  Something like discord or slack
[11/23/23, 1:12:44 PM] Anupa/diya: I had suggested Slack earlier . I feel all active projects should be moved to Slack
[11/23/23, 1:14:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Personally, I have fatigue from running this on WhatsApp.  I have to scroll through hundreds of messages that have nothing to do with me to find the message that I'm looking for.

It's exhausting,

[11/23/23, 1:29:16 PM] Val Lapidus: This needs to be a decision completely agreed on by the governors
[11/23/23, 3:03:23 PM] Gary Teh: It is your *Autonomy* 🙂🙏

_PS: what I observe is the herd behavior tends to follow DAO members exercising personal *Autonomy* in executing critical functions in our DAO._

_After analyzing all the different functions, the most *critical ones* are_ 

    - _ledger update_ 
    - _fiat funding_
    - _supply chain management_

_If there is only one DAO member exercising *Autonomy* in any of these, then the DAO becomes centralized around that specific function_ ‎<This message was edited>

Did a 10 minute research at the codebase level, *_Uniswap*_ might be more suitable for Ethereum ERC20 token types once we migrated our TDG governance tokens over from Solana to Ethereum 

*_Uniswap*_ allows for Automated market making and also liquidity pool staking using _USDT/ETH/BTC_. 

Assuming @16468233438 @41799155602 @12245781775 and @31641075825 can handle all the *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops_* amongst themselves without my further involvement in that area for both USA and Europe, once I am done with my 21 day meditation retreat I can finally drop my *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops*_ hat and put on my *_Engineering*_ hat and do some actual smart contract coding after a hiatus of slightly more than to a year while getting my hands dirty in  the *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops*_ department ‎<This message was edited>

Actually if you are really keen on Slack you should just go ahead and revive this slack channel 🙂🙏
https://join.slack.com/t/truesight-group/shared_invite/zt-27r7rowr6-NBR58UmtHKNen2jBZRKq~A

Neil (DAO member and former engineering manager at Edmodo) set it up when he and his brother started working on some engineering related tasked. 

Richard was active on it as well when he was helping build out the frontend UI of Edgar. 

Gautam (_Technical staff contextual Ai_) was also hanging out in that channel when we were discussing how USA college students understood Metaverse as well as exploring various implementations of Zero Knowledge proofs on blockchain for the prediction market project from last year

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_LAioUeYvbSuuCuiPCd87t4VLx_PkqXBn3ggIn8Fxs/edit#heading=h.efqfwk7iwt0y 

From my perspective it might actually be easier to poll slack for messages to automate contribution tokenization than it is for WhatsApp. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/27/23, 12:26:00 AM] Gary Teh: *key constrains to consider*

    - slack charges after a certain number of people joins

   - slack does not allow access to historical messages older than 3 months without paying 

*_proposal for you if you are keen_*

Go ahead and start it as a side experiment with folks you work closely with. 

If it gains traction great. 

If not, it was a cheap experiment

Hi! We are developing super fast here & working on new community rules now. Please be informed of... XYZ & the consequences of not being active are... XYZ.
[11/29/23, 9:11:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: People have different reasons for not being much involved and the fact that they weren't over the last 3 months doesn't mean they wouldn't like to be involved in the future. A transparent communication on this change will help everyone.
[11/29/23, 9:12:16 PM] Iwona Fluda: and definitely will help in building long-term relationships with people.
[11/29/23, 9:12:38 PM] Gary Teh: The rules will have been published in the @120363044914723610@g.us channel 

Perhaps you might want to craft the copy when the policy gets published once the voting period for this incoming policy is over? 🙂🙏
[11/29/23, 9:13:27 PM] Gary Teh: That is true. 

Nothing preventing them from joining the @120363041505997891@g.us again since they are governance token holders
[11/29/23, 9:13:55 PM] Iwona Fluda: It is great that it has been published. I think we had this discussion once: How many of us read the Terms & Conditions of every community we are joining? I guess: none.
[11/29/23, 9:14:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Sending everyone an email or a message with this information before enforcing this decision will help people to rethink their involvement.
[11/29/23, 9:16:54 PM] Iwona Fluda: I'm not sure if that would be helpful. Once trust is broken, then is broken; not sure how many people would even consider coming back. 

Just speaking from experience as I have run private communities over the last few years, and everything there is based on trust and mutual understanding.
[11/29/23, 9:30:04 PM] Gary Teh: There is also the other perspective too

For folks who hasn’t been in these channels for a long time, sending them a direct message regarding something that they no longer care about will just come across as spam in their inbox
[11/29/23, 9:33:59 PM] Iwona Fluda: We don't know if they don't care about it. Depending on the message it can be also taken as a great reminder to them that it exists.
[11/29/23, 9:34:42 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps the middle way would be the *_governor*_ who volunteers to do the pruning please exercise your *_autonomy*_ by using your discretion 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Those that we don’t, we have some of their LinkedIn, Instagram or WhatsApp on the tab ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 9:47:03 PM] Gary Teh: In all 7 WhatsApp channels 

The reason why this clean up is because I know alot of folks use WhatsApp for communicating with their families and very close friends, so having undesired messages on their WhatsApp feels way more intrusive than on their LinkedIn, email, Instagram…

Hence the reason why I really want to minimize this intrusion into their private space ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 9:48:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: On this list, just a small group of people has their phone number or email address...
[11/29/23, 9:49:27 PM] Iwona Fluda: This is an assumption, we don't know if that's true. Unless you run a survey on this and asked them privately about their needs and preferences.
[11/29/23, 9:52:07 PM] Gary Teh: That would be very interesting 

I know a lot of them don’t even bother to respond to my private 1 on 1 message until months later (_on the average six months_)🤣

the USA government has a shutdown scenario that is often reported in the news

He is helping bring our cacao nibs to showcase to merchants in Wisconsin 

He is also going to be visiting Kenya next year 

I have suggested for him to meet @254700187599 while he is there to figure out the macadamia nuts logistics which @254700187599 is sourcing 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 9:36:01 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: That will be great! We have a bounty harvest this season.

 We are currently sourcing for markets. Ideally, the market should be addressed in advance but we had some issues from our ministry of trade earlier in the year.

We have two main harvests for macadamia in Kenya.
[12/2/23, 9:36:31 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I'll be delighted to meet him and show him around.

[12/4/23, 5:34:48 PM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan for Agroverse sales related activities*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions to commercial buyer 

    - utilize existing 4 rules rubric based system without introducing additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the initial sale from buyer

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO, DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call for coordination_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator but not the role of sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a buyer. All prior listed rules (1-4) applies
[12/4/23, 5:36:08 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Have this set of rules come into effect?
‎OPTION: Yes! It offers proper incentive for sales related activities while keeping tokenomics balanced (2 votes)
‎OPTION: No! Why so much new rules!?! (0 votes)
[12/4/23, 9:49:40 PM] Val Lapidus: Is this closing door on any fiat compensation or is that still available to sellers
[12/4/23, 11:31:12 PM] Gary Teh: Totally closed
[12/5/23, 9:44:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I think it's better to involve the first round of decision making with people who are actively working in the project and then it can come the DAO
[12/5/23, 12:08:35 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with @918017107841 hence why I have proposed a debate in the agroverse guild to flush out the best suitable incentives model for scaling a FMCG. This current proposal doesn’t reflect the complete value chain.
[12/5/23, 12:09:47 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I vote for n.3: current proposal not suitable for agroverse business model.
[12/5/23, 1:29:52 PM] Gary Teh: Since this does impact the distribution of governance tokens and hence voting rights within our DAO. 

The town hall is a more appropriate place for this debate to take place 

@120363044028036610@g.us is discussions for day to day operational matters only 

*_Analogy*_
    - @120363044028036610@g.us is the factory floor where workers build stuff

    - Townhall is where all the board of directors (general assembly) sit to discuss about policy matters impacting the entire DAO 

_PS: you don’t cook dinner in the toilet_
[12/5/23, 1:47:19 PM] Vlatko Gigov: No problem, we can discuss anywhere: 

What is the commission charged for processing payments on the agroverse shop? 

What is the commission charged by Amazon for selling products on their platform? 

Why should there be a discrimination against a human sales force if other mediums are adequately compensated? 

What is the incentive of the 46 other town hall members to actually act as a board of directors instead of just the empty floscule about board of directors exercising governance rights based on their tokens. 

How will you incentivise a decentralized sales force other than with $ sales commissions? If the sales rep wishes to relinquish the $ commission and obtain gov tokens that should be at their discretion.
[12/5/23, 1:47:54 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Otherwise this whole exercise becomes like the good ol’ communist order: we are all equal but some are more equal than the others. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 1:49:44 PM] Anupa/diya: The reason for proposing is that the internal team will be much for equipped to take decisions for matters that they work on rather in a whatsapp group where people will have to invest time reading, doing some sort of research if they lack information and then make decision. Which I clearly don't see happening
[12/5/23, 1:56:08 PM] Vlatko Gigov: FMCG scaling is much more different than selling software products. Also the relatives of our organisation do not allow for a salaried sales force. Even if the ales force was on a salary base there would still be % remuneration for successful sales. In the current case, the remuneration proposed only cators to a select few BOD members.
[12/5/23, 1:56:33 PM] Vlatko Gigov: “We are all equal but some are more equal than the others”
[12/5/23, 2:01:04 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess the questions that we need to answer are:

1. How do we incentivise a decentralised sales force (Herbalife model maybe IDK)

2. How do we make sure everyone’s efforts are adequately and appropriately compensated? 

3. Your proposed model only allows for one thing to happen: a huge DUMP or even worse a rug pull from the largest token holders or the treasurer, if you remember our exciting trip in Dubai and the experts… 🤣
I hope your toilet analogy is not n.3 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 2:03:39 PM] Vlatko Gigov: @everyone these are very exciting times of this DAO, being there nearly from the beginning it’s a great experience. Many have told us that things will disintegrate much sooner. That we will never get this far because: there is not huge capital from a coin offering to incentivise contributions against or there isn’t a liquid token to exchange for.
[12/5/23, 2:04:20 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I’m open to other suggestions as long as we move slightly away from far left economic models. 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 2:07:28 PM] Vlatko Gigov: But liquidity will happen if we develop a sound economic model and incentives structures. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 2:49:33 PM] Vlatko Gigov: By the way I am arguing here against my case since I hold second or third largest tdg purse, which is pointless if I don’t have an army of motivated and incentivised sales force to scale organic agroverse products… ie bringing dollarz to the treasury ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 2:50:49 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The other route would be let’s do an ICO and hope not to get flagged by the SEC if our bizz models fail and we deplete the treasury…
[12/5/23, 2:51:20 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I would always choose structured organic growth before a crowdfunding operation.
[12/5/23, 2:51:57 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Then once we have stable revenue models we can do a coin offering.
[12/5/23, 2:53:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess you are right @14153000019 to discuss these matters here: 1. Governance, 2. Treasury Management, 3. Sales force incentives
[12/5/23, 5:05:25 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to start incentivizing people with Fiat.  issuing tokens for me personally is fine.  but I think we can get a higher quality of sales people by giving them a monitary incentive to sell the product. And don’t get all flustered that most people are not here to be capitalists.  We are selling to capitalists, we should probably employ a few that understand the motivations.
[12/5/23, 5:07:17 PM] Val Lapidus: And as I’ve stated previously the monitory incentive to sell can be collected by any one, regardless of where they live, there is no barrier to entry to do this job, and there is nothing to prevent you from doing it.
[12/5/23, 5:28:23 PM] Gary Teh: We should test this hypothesis 

*Proposed test*

Recruit 10 test subjects to do sales 

5 subjects granted fiat only incentive 

5 subjects granted TDG only incentive 

All 10 subjects granted the same script to use to sell

Each subject required to generate their own sales leads 

Measure sales performance (average sales generated per subject) of these 2 groups over a 90 day period 

Group with the higher average sales revenue generated is *winning variant*

Roll out variant into production environment

_PS: someone else will need to run this experiment. I am exercising my *autonomy* not to do it as it is boring for me and I will be utilizing my time to do something else 🙂🙏_
[12/5/23, 5:44:21 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what needs to be proved out here. Gary.  And I'm going to practice my autonomy by not doing this and urge my fellow governor's not to do this as well. Human kind has been incentivized by money for hundreds of years. What? What am I proving?  So far our sales have been zero.  People have always had the autonomy to go and sell the product.  But have not utilized it.
[12/5/23, 5:45:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The logical option would be for sales agents to exercise autonomy: whether they want to receive $ or tokens or a mix of the two.
[12/5/23, 5:46:53 PM] Gary Teh: They don’t have the tools to sell

No tools no sales
[12/5/23, 5:47:36 PM] Vlatko Gigov: https://mapmycustomers.me/2021/10/13/average-sales-rep-compensation-by-industry/
[12/5/23, 5:47:44 PM] Val Lapidus: Has anyone actually volunteered and asked for the tools to sell?
[12/5/23, 5:48:21 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Well the simple deck / product information sheet hasn’t been prepared. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 5:50:57 PM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 asked for a presentation deck not a sales deck
‎[12/5/23, 5:51:36 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/5/23, 5:51:39 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Yes the sales deck should just one page in the pres deck.
[12/5/23, 5:52:19 PM] Val Lapidus: If they are highly motivated, they can build whatever materials they want to sell the product
[12/5/23, 5:52:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The story existed, and it’s a good one. Now that we have the momentum we shouldn’t give up..
[12/5/23, 5:52:39 PM] Val Lapidus: They have a forum within agroverse to ask questions
[12/5/23, 5:53:10 PM] Val Lapidus: This is an autonomous out organization and should function as one.
[12/5/23, 5:53:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: When @918017107841 was in the agroverse guild things were running a tad bit smoother. Al thought that is not her scope.
[12/5/23, 5:55:24 PM] Val Lapidus: There is no one and nothing stopping the people wanting to sell from selling.  If they need materials to sell, they need to build the materials, not wait for me, or Gary, or any one else to be the bottleneck.  Autonomy is defined as: the right or condition of self-government.
[12/5/23, 5:58:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Makes sense to me. As I am illiterate in design work, I do exercise my autonomy to seek for help
[12/5/23, 5:58:35 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 🤣
[12/5/23, 6:09:30 PM] Gary Teh: Most of them don’t even know how the product actually looks and feel like 

It is very hard to pitch a physical product to a buyer without having one in your hand

The first thing I notice anyone does when they pick up the product is to put it to their nose and breathe in ecstasy 

Kind of hard to replicate that buying experience without the actual product in hand 🤣
[12/5/23, 6:10:15 PM] Val Lapidus: If they need the product, they should ask
[12/5/23, 6:10:40 PM] Val Lapidus: The only one who’se asked is Rodney and Vigi
[12/5/23, 6:10:55 PM] Gary Teh: And they did 

@41799155602 and @19209806391 

I know @18175503434 was asking about it when we chatted
[12/5/23, 8:12:52 PM] Vlatko Gigov: For me the deck / product spec is more important. Retailers know what nibs are they don’t know why our nibs differentiate from the non-organic competitors. Agroverse story is strong. Most of that info is in the website… ‎<This message was edited>

Please apologize to her privately 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/6/23, 2:31:52 AM] Anupa/diya: Let's we take Autonomy has an example. Everyone has their own idea of what autonomy looks like  

In a project, if there are set actions given then those must be followed. if someone is doing something and someone else comes in and says it's my autonomy to change things. That's not on and it's a waste of time. 

Autonomy has to be defined for each project according to me because the variables differ from case to case.
[12/6/23, 2:35:05 AM] Anupa/diya: The people working within the project can decide what autonomy looks like for them and for larger issues it can be referenced to the DAO.
[12/6/23, 2:39:01 AM] Vlatko Gigov: That is why the contributions rubric was the closest thing to autonomy imo. I understand it’s a nightmare to keep track of the variables, but it only makes sense to appropriate quality metrics instead of quantity (# of hours)
[12/6/23, 2:43:42 AM] Anupa/diya: There can be sections - work remuneration past and present / work ethics/ deliverables/ code of conduct/ and so forth . This will also come under the governance. The main structure can be sub divided to small groups.
[12/6/23, 3:03:56 AM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 and @918017107841 

Please feel free to exercise your autonomy to work together to define and then propose a new rubric for voting into effect. 

I am open to exercising my autonomy to stand aside and refrain from further contribution to DAO until the new rubric has been proposed and voted on 🙂🙏

_PS: from my perspective this is part of DAO’s process of maturing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/6/23, 3:11:41 AM] Anupa/diya: I don't think this should be the case. Let it run as it is for now till a group of active members can collectively draw up something defined

Two people from the DAO  might not reflect the voice of what the DAO wants. The governors table along with any other members can sort this out

There are a lot of things that need to be discussed.Rubric is one of them.
[12/6/23, 3:12:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Rubric has to taken in a lot of aspects and it has to be a collective decision so I wait for that group to be formed.
[12/6/23, 8:12:58 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe there should be a definition for the workflow and values for each specific project and people inside agree to that if not, they leave.
‎[12/6/23, 9:48:23 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/6/23, 9:57:53 AM] Tomas - Offchain: the questions about engagement, ghosting, rules, behaviors, incentives, and payments are still in the air, Maybe ghosting here was an answer to a specific situation or a wrongly defined problem. Maybe it would be valuable to understand what happened to understand which rules work better. I would ask why did it happen to understand the root cause a little more. I agree that waiting for something that undermines our autonomy goes against the core principles.

[12/6/23, 1:05:03 PM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense, that is because your entire kharma within the ecosystem is recorded on the chain

Reddit for example does not allow members with exceptionally low kharma to contribute in certain things 

From my perspective, if a member’s kharma point is too low, I will be hesitant in allowing member to undertake task on critical path in projects even if member volunteers to do so

If you haven’t noticed already, new incoming members reaching out to me offering to help are often first assigned to task that are not on the critical path. 

The purpose of this is do an integrity verification

[12/6/23, 10:54:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel we need to update the governance model. A lot of it comes under for ethics and code of conduct. Deciding on actions over a poll on whatspp is slightly hasty 🤣 I feel there has to be a state and agreed document by the group where all or these are stayed and with outcomes decided for the most and then the voting should come into play.i don't think we can so lightly state strike outs. 

One might not even agree to the strike outs since it was not even stated by them so where is the autonomy in that. I don't think anyone is at the position to state a strike out even for themselves because it has to be community led and not dependent on one person and their decision.

One should be allowed to propose a strike out or any other rule, the town hall decide and then decide. 

When there is governors all categories should be voted or discussed for future voting

[12/7/23, 3:26:19 AM] Anupa/diya: The second conversation which I think that needs to start is the participation of the community. Since the participation is low with the given numbers. We should try and look at what the community wants. Everyone in the beer hall has so much to offer and the key question is how can they find value in the community and vice versa. 

Not everyone will be invested in the currents projects. So how do we mobilize the community. Cypher defense days  were great with so much activity

doesnt seem like there is going to be a pressing need for me to meet up physically with you to discuss the Swiss association tie up for the CeX listing since based on preliminary that is not going to go through

[12/12/23, 8:05:14 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 has disqualified himself yesterday on item 3

He is not a sales person

He is an ops person

The right people to discuss these are people actually going to undertake sales or have undertaken sales within the context of our DAO

Right now they are myself, you, @19209806391 and @12245781775

_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels

let me know when you have withdrawn the brazilian Rei from our USA bank account to cover R$299 you have fronted using your own money 

DAO is right now owing you money and you are incurring loses from you funds not being able to deployed back to your personal investment account 

Thank you for helping facilitate that 🙂🙏
[12/15/23, 3:19:13 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030

I think the right thing to do in this case would be to compensate you for the interest losses using our treasury balance for facilitating this transaction even though you could have just ignore our request for help. 

I am aware amongst all the DAO members here there are those that are not short on cash to finance their personal day to day expenses and you definitely not one of them. 

When you make the withdrawal in Brazilian R$ please also withdraw the amount for interest you would have otherwise made had the loan amount you provided to the DAO stayed deployed in your own investment account. 

If anyone else in the TownHall please state your case now otherwise  we will just leave it as that 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Hook that WhatsApp account into our groups 

All messages sent to groups will be received by WhatsApp account 

WhatsApp forwards all the messages received via that account to our Python server in the cloud 

Python server in the cloud calls OpenAi to determine if message is someone submitting a contribution and how much TDG score should be awarded if it is 

For every message forwarded to WhatsApp account, we are charged 

This is just speculation at the moment not event sure if we could even hook the account into our WhatsApp groups

[1/4/24, 12:18:20 AM] Gary Teh: Part of the conversation had with @41799155602 today was regarding fundraising 

We technically don’t really have much use for the funds 

What we really need now is relationship that potential investors have with the distributors and retailers more so than we need their money 

Taking investor money is more for the purpose of forcing them to put their money where their mouth is. Literally tapping into the *_sunk cost fallacy cognitive bias*_ and the *_consistency cognitive bias*_. 

*_Sunk cost fallacy*_
Once your money is parked here, it is less likely you will invest your relationship in another competing project which is basically like shooting yourself in the foot. 

This is an effective way of keeping out copycat projects that attempt to replicate the same route with the same set of investors 

VCs have this policy where they do not invest in another competing company once they have placed their bet on what they think is a winning horse in the space.

And those with integrity will inform incoming teams of their existing positions before clearing saying no to them. 

*_Consistency bias*_
Once you said yes to a small ask, it is more likely you will say yes to a bigger ask later one. As For smaller ask later on, go figure…

Also a slightly larger treasury also tend to give a sense of formidability which has the effect of discouraging other copy cats when they see the size of the balance sheet. Though technically having a strong balance does not always lead to more effective execution and at times serve more as a distraction… I could personally attest to this… it is much better for DAO members to be forced to be scrappy and justify the use of every single dollar in our vault than to be irresponsibly throwing DAO funds around chasing after bullshit ideas (… _and become the next SBF_… )

that is why our DAO’s treasury till now continues to looks so broke from the perspective of an unsuspecting outsider 🤔🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/4/24, 12:51:27 AM] Gary Teh: Once the Swiss association is setup, the fiat funds deployed from our DAO treasury to TrueTech Inc to help setup Agroverse infrastructure in USA will issued as shares from TrueTech Inc to the Swiss association at the price of 1USD per share

@41799155602 will be representing the Swiss association entity by joining the board of directors on TrueTech Inc 

@41799155602 will also be a director sitting on the board of the Swiss association (_since he is the only Swiss that has volunteered for the board so far and has consistently contributed during the life cycle of our DAO as we came to each critical checkpoint along our journey_)

I would propose a nomination and election process for the remaining directors that will sit on the board of the Swiss association

Total number of directors sitting on the board should be voted upon by DAO general assembly members ‎<This message was edited>
[1/4/24, 6:04:54 AM] Suheil - Europe: the most important step with creating a “mother” swiss association is to build strong mother legal framework.

we need to fundraise to :
- set up legal framework
- ⁠hire operations team to scale agroverse  ops: sales, marketing and design 
- ⁠set up the required tech environment ( lessons to learn from the failing website project —> we ended up over spending on something that still doesnt work 🤷 decentralied autonomy iis beautiful but for managing a project someone should be responsible.

Sure always open if the price is right
[1/17/24, 7:37:57 AM] Suheil - Europe: i think we can negotiate a % based deal. no need to purchase . or worse case scenario we can lease for 50years + years or like how all churches do back in my home country 99years + lease 😂
[1/17/24, 7:39:54 AM] Gary Teh: That works too. 

Need to figure out who is going to be handling the operations though 

If the land is in USA I can handle it. If it is ease well the DAO member there needs to deal with it

[1/23/24, 1:41:37 AM] Gary Teh: After rounds of discussion this seems to be the set of hypothesis that @120363045796860099@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to utilize waste collected from the surrounding area to turn a barren piece of land into a productive one 

- ⁠productivity could be achieved by systematic application of circular economy principles 

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of soil regeneration through the use of waste material (_courtesy of @41765737357_)

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of permaculture techniques used by the indigenous on regenerated soil

- ⁠productivity could be achieved via construction of off grid data center facility where bulk if not all of the materials are scavenged from elsewhere at a fraction of the commercial cost if not for free

- ⁠productivity could be achieved with minimal deployment of fiat resources
[1/23/24, 3:04:53 AM] Gary Teh: And this seems to be the set of hypotheses that @120363044028036610@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to crowdsource the setup and operations of a supply chain

- ⁠crowdsourcing can yield produces that restore communities and regenerates environment 

- ⁠integrity can be crowdsourced to tackle existing fraud in shipping industry which has caused banks to stop issuing Letter of Credits
[1/23/24, 3:09:00 AM] Gary Teh: The set of hypotheses we seek to validate with @120363208199596306@g.us 

- alpha signal can be generated when people from diverse geographical location and industrial background are pooled together for discussions

- ⁠AI like ChatGpt can be used to synthesize signals to generate a well crafted report

- ⁠outsiders will perceived value in alpha generated 

- ⁠outsiders will be willing to pay to gain access to alpha genersted via crowdsourced discussions coupled with AI synthesis

[1/23/24, 4:43:57 AM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363045796860099@g.us* 

As linear economy business models progress, climate change intensifies, resulting in expanded desert land and rising sea levels. How can humans adapt to this reality without perpetuating the forces that fueled the change?
[1/23/24, 4:54:43 AM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363044028036610@g.us* 

Exploitative middlemen diminish earnings for cacao and commodity farmers. Meanwhile, in developing nations, land is sold cheaply to Chinese corporations, transforming it into soybean and cattle farms, contributing to deforestation and climate change. How do we break this vicious cycle?
[1/23/24, 5:10:14 AM] Gary Teh: *problem statement for @120363208199596306@g.us* 

Navigating the influx of information, disinformation, and misinformation on the internet poses a challenge for making well-informed decisions in personal resource deployment. 

Despite subject matter experts holding crucial insights, their voices often face suppression amidst the noise. 

How can thought leaders collaboratively address this issue to ensure accurate information guides effective decision-making?

- Integrity without compromising on Privacy

Regarding point 2: this is part of the reason why there has been a recent heavy influx of new members into our @120363044542957540@g.us. Bulk of these new members are steeped in various spiritual traditions and ethical frameworks.

- ⁠during every equinox/solstice, existing guild members are invited to share their personal 90 day action plan to further the mission of the guild 

- ⁠if there is existing guild member can’t figure an action plan for themselves they can invite other guild members to propose an action plan for them which they might feel enthusiastic about 

- ⁠if there is not match to be had existing guild member are invited to join the guild again in the future when there is a match meanwhile free up slots for other members who might have a match

[2/10/24, 3:02:19 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this is a looser more decentralized version of the Sprint protocol commonly used in teams using agile 

I observed @33652866472 attempting to use Sprint in House of Balance last year. It did not turn out very well. 

From my perspective, the primary reason is because the required level of effort coordination between various team members in a sprint as well as the frequency of the cadence is too high considering everyone has their own daily jobs to attend to. 

From my experience, running product development teams, when members are very experienced and senior in their domain, the best approach is to start by first sitting with them to determine what is the epic quest they feel strongly for, and then help them define their own goal they want to achieve at the end of this epic quest of theirs. Thereafter work backwards and break down the quest into smaller chunks. Finally just get out of the way, but periodically do a check in with them. 

For quests that require tighter coordination between team members, it’s best to colocate the team members for the duration of the quest. 

Back in the previous startup we had this concept called the _war room_ where the entire product development team was colocated in the same room for an duration until a very specific (_usually very critical_) milestone is hit (_usually a product launch or a major crisis is averted_). 

I understood from Brian (_another DAO member_) when Google wave was being launched way back then, the entire product team were shipped over to Sydney and then colocated in an office till it finally got launched. Back when I was on his team a few startups ago, when we were getting from seed stage to Series A, we were just in war room by default the entire 1.5 years

I personally tested the war room concept with @5511982667030 and then later @16468233438 when we were setting up the supply chain of cacao nibs from the rainforest to USA. Turn around time was in hours rather than in days. 

_PS: something to note, different teams end up implementing sprint differently depending on their group dynamics_ 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[2/23/24, 4:10:18 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, since this is a DAO, granting any individuals dedicated emails account from the TrueSight DAO domain has the undesirable effect of granting them privileged status making them more equal than others.

•⁠  ⁠admin@truesight.me
•⁠  ⁠⁠support@agroverse

More email addresses from TrueSight DAO managed domains that fulfill specific DAO needs can be made available in future but will be subjected to DAO voting decision prior to creation

This means that *_garyjob@truesight.me_* email address which I have been using till now will no longer exist moving forward. 
To ensure no emails are dropped, emails sent to this legacy address are being routed to garyjob@getdata.io. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

*Marketing 4Ps of our cacao nibs re-examined*

_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to more care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

[3/10/24, 11:13:13 AM] Gary Teh: Once either the *_TikTok retail customer acquisition strategy_* or the *_chocolatier customer acquisition strategy*_ has been validated and proven to be viable, it makes sense to raise capital to scale them

Capital will be deployed for the purpose of accelerating the rate of market saturation within the USA market. Our estimates for the Total Addressable Market size (_TAM_) becomes important to provide visibility on how big the pie is going to be 

Capital will be raised via private sales of tokens to accredited investors using SAFT. That way, we do not get on the wrong side of SEC regulation

_PS: this is where a lot of founders who pitch me their project for fundraising purposes gets it wrong and totally mess up the pitch._

_*Investors do not invest money so that founders can pay their bills and live comfortably*_

_funds raised are for the purpose of either *building and testing a commercial prototype* or *accelerating the scaling of a business model* once it’s proven viable at a smaller scale._ ‎<This message was edited>

[3/18/24, 2:14:25 PM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour updating AGL2 with recent transactions. 

https://agroverse.shop/agl2
‎[3/18/24, 2:14:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/19/24, 9:39:35 AM] Gary Teh: Been thinking through our Agroverse Ledgers (_AGL1 and AGL2 so far_)

Our per unit cost gets lower when the shipment size larger. 

There are three constraints we are dealing with 

- Being able to test the market at the lower price point before we ship in a larger shipping volume 

- ⁠ The lag time between when the order is placed and when the shipment arrives at the port

- ⁠ interest of Investors in each AGL is taken care of

I’m starting to think of each AGL as its own special purpose vehicle (SPV) 

To get around the above constrains, it makes sense to allow one AGL to lend inventory (_cacao_) to another AGL while charging an interest rate on the inventory on loan. Loan interest is to be repaid in inventory (_Cacao_) 

Interest rate will be at the prevailing standard rate that DAO has voted on. 

AGL3 can also opt to repay in fiat at the exchange rate imposed by AGL2 

Example: AGL2 lends 5 KG of cacao nips to AGL3. Cacao nips are paid by AL3 to AGL3 one month later. Total amount repaid is 5.07KG of cacao nibs 

*Benefits*

- AGL3 gets to test the market at the new lower price point before the inventory arrives

- AGL2 gets their inventory refreshed. Shelf life is extended.

- ⁠AGL2 get more inventory under management by offering the service to AGL3

[3/26/24, 12:47:13 PM] Gary Teh: makes sense to bump listing price for this 1 metric ton of cacao shipment to 182% of cacao futures market price 

- *_Expected sale price of total shipment to chocolatiers: USD20,000*_

- ⁠USD13,000: 130% goes to pay cooperative  

- ⁠USD2,700 for freighting the shipment into USA 

- ⁠USD2,500: 16% for TrueSight DAO management and ongoing sales and marketing expenses to chocolatier

- ⁠Expected net profit to investors based on current prevailing RWA investors: *_USD1,800*_


_Right now USA  chocolatier we contacted is willing to pay up to USD20/kg. Basically *USD20k for the 1 ton shipment*_

_investors of the RWA will already be making 9% return on capital for just holding the shipment till maturity_

_Price chocolatiers are willing to pay will go up as market price of cacao future increases. All the market potential upside will go to the investors of the RWA as climate change worsens and prices for cacao continues to escalate_ 🤩

- access to privileges/functions in DAO should be tiered and based on level of trust earned.

- ⁠while financing amount might be considered small for residents in developed parts of the world, this amount might be a matter of life and death to residents in the developing parts of the world. It is important to treat every transaction seriously with the counter parties in these parts of the world with empathy. 

*Actionable next steps*

- schedule of tier access to functionalities/privileges in DAO based on level of Trust and prior history of successful delivery of tasks

- access to ⁠communications to suppliers to be restricted to active governors only ‎<This message was edited>

[4/3/24, 7:20:35 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes with folks from StartEngine

*Key take aways*

- ⁠3% commission in the form of equity used for raising
- ⁠Upfront fee for SEC filing is USD10K
- ⁠minimum raise is USD500K
- ⁠Does not do fund raising in exchange for tokens
- ⁠A platform that allows easy fundraising from your community (_even non-accredited investors_)
- ⁠They also have their own community

*Next steps*
- Not suitable for use with our shipment financing needs
- ⁠Perhaps might be suitable to raise via TrueTech Inc bridging (_if we figure out what exactly to utilize the minimal of USD500,000 for and for what ROI returns as well as how to stitch financing structure into our existing Token based one_)
‎[4/3/24, 7:20:45 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/3/24, 10:43:23 PM] Gary Teh: my thoughts on funding matters

When deploying capital it’s either to exploit some alpha or some beta 

- alpha - some element about a commercial venture that was not there but will at some point be there 

- ⁠beta - some element about a commercial venture that used to be there and will likely return. 

Regarding Agroverse, it would be more likely a story of Alpha if it does come to pass . 

What was priorly Emptiness is ends up getting occupied by some entity that got collectively summoned from the Ethers by the community 

*_Purpose of AGL1*_
- prove it is possible to bring in a commercial shipment of cacao nibs across the border without issues from FDA (_in my luggage_)

- ⁠prove it is possible to identify a viable product configuration and some evidence of a workable distribution channel (_night market organized by @16468233438_)

- ⁠payload: 5KG

*_Purpose of AGL2*_
- prove we can bring in a shipment via a freighting company 

- ⁠prove it is possible to identify a distribution channel where we can conduct repeated sales (_Sunday market channel proven by @16468233438 via TyTyCoCo and via our website setup by @557191035605 and @918017107841 and offline tasting events by Gary_)

- payload: 100KG


_*Purpose of AGL3_*

- Prove we can further scale known distribution channels by operating 2 Sunday market stores 

- ⁠Prove we can drive more sales via our website by systematically conducting more offline tasting events 

- ⁠Payload: 1000KG

After this afternoon’s conversation with the folks from StartEngine, from a financial engineering standpoint point there are two possible ways to finance AGL3. 

One is via what we have already voted into effect, float a separate set of RWA tokens to finance the shipping of AGL3 into USA. Seems the cleanest but might not be very interesting for folks with lots of capital to deploy and want some stakes for the *_home run*_, because we boot their positions out once we have proven we could scale our distribution 

The other method is to allow them to inject their capital directly into TrueSight DAO Entity at a pre-money valuation of 1.9 million USD (_what we have all already sunk in so far_) where they can join the rest of us for the *_home run*_.

Via the second method, instead of TrueSight DAO being a manager of investors fund to finance the shipment, TrueSight DAO itself finance the shipment.

For second method of fund injection, we need a more comprehensive capital deployment schedule on how USD500k could be immediately deployed if and when provided and what is the expected valuation of the organization as a whole once this new capital has been fully deployed

_PS: you don’t go to investors asking for a huge amount of capital injection and giving pay bills and live comfortably as your only reason. 🤦_

_its a lot of upfront work to craft the gun (plausible growth models) so that they can load in their bullets (capital) and pull the trigger (use the money as planned) 🤯_ ‎<This message was edited>

Counter party has became incommunicado (_a case of compromised Integrity_) after we have sent him payments for the 5KG cacao nibs that @16468233438 requested

As suggested by @5511982667030, levels of trust should be tiered (_not just to DAO members but also potential suppliers to Agroverse network_). 

*Suggested revision to protocol for onboarding suppliers to Agroverse network*

- initial small sample not more than USD250 in value upon first contact, to mitigate against a rug pull as well as to ensure quality is good before sinking further resources into the relationship

- ⁠Arrange for site visit to conduct inspection to access facility exist, counter party is person of _*Integrity_*, process in place at facility is up to US FDA standards

- Sign USA FSVP documents ⁠ to qualify facility for exporting into USA market

- ⁠Actual samples of 5KG is collected during the site visit.

_PS: as with the case on how personnel staffing is managed at the network of ammunition supplies facilities I was serving at during my time in the Singapore army, personnel with _*Compromised Integrity_* is immediately removed to ensure integrity of the network._

_During my visit to Bahia, @5511982667030 has helped setup relationships with the head of the local police department in the event counter party located in the area decides to go renegade, we should try to replicate model this for all future supplies we choose to onboard_ ‎<This message was edited>

[4/12/24, 9:45:21 AM] Gary Teh: For content marketing strategy to be effective, content needs to be hyper focused around a specific target profile to the exclusion of all other potential target profiles. 

Our content marketing strategy will be a 360 degree coverage of the pain points the target profile will experience as they engage in their primary activities

This will have the effect of establishing the @120363044028036610@g.us brand as a thought leader within the target niche.

I thought maybe he is just a lurker or there are so many instances in public groups of zoom attacks. I asked twice of his intent .

 I believe he told Gary that he is in an investor. He could come have clear about it . He was asked quite a few times

One way we could scale @120363044028036610@g.us via this dimension to offer a highly differentiated offering versus the other cacao suppliers is to partner up with an entire network of cacao ceremony shamans in the USA. 

They offer the experience in their locality while we do the following 

- underwrite the legal risk of dealing with FDA

- ⁠financing to bring down per unit cost of cacao supplies by importing in volume 

- ⁠logistics of getting the cacao out of the Amazon rainforest and getting them shipped to the shamans 

- ⁠proper hedging to ensure stable prices 

The outcome is a harmonious symbiosis 

Recording of their cacao ceremony will also help power our content marketing initiatives 

We will know for sure if this model will work if and when make a sale to a third cacao ceremony shaman

TrueTech Inc. board of directors has elected to rebook governance tokens under @41799155602 for all tokens previously booked to TrueTech Inc that were booked due to @41799155602 contributions of fiat for expenses to paid on behalf of DAO.

[5/8/24, 4:59:06 PM] Vlatko Gigov: to vote on matters: 

- context should be provided
- ⁠analysis on alternatives 
- ⁠scenarios anticipated

Voting on trivial matters diminishes the value of the vote and the wisdom of the Town Hall. Each guild prepares a specific proposal if they want to call in the town hall and it’s decision power. 

Radical transparency is a great tool when used appropriately. Radical inclusion only works when everyone is performing to the expected levels of commitment. If these conditions are not met, in my personal opinion the collective disarrays. Incentives and expectations are the driving force behind everyone’s decision. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/11/24, 9:36:45 AM] Gary Teh: After spending three years working with the DAO framework, I’m inclined to conclude that direct democracies is  *_NOT_* a suitable analogy to use when referencing DAOs. This is namely because

- DAO participants do not depend on the DAO for their livelihood and they do not experience hardship when DAO fails. (_when Ukraine is invaded, Ukrainians die. When DAO fails, no one will feel the pinch_)
 
- ⁠there is no yearly taxation requirements for continued participation (_totally open if we want to vote into effect yearly subscription fees for rights to vote in townhall_)

- ⁠there is not much of a common pool of resource that is large enough where people feel the desire to steward over (_problem will get resolved when we start charging yearly subscription for continued rights to policy voting access_)

So while this document is a good share on how direct democracies work, it is not applicable for DAOs.

[5/11/24, 9:41:24 AM] Vlatko Gigov: when incentives and expectations align of most dao members then you could consider a form of direct democracy applicable to a sort of “digital nation”. Until then the exploratory nature of this dao remains, and voting remains trivial. I do love the exercise.
[5/11/24, 9:47:47 AM] Gary Teh: The best way to align incentive and expectations is to up the ante. 

That way folks who are not up for it can self select out of the general assembly and excuse themselves from further involvement in policy matters 

The rest of the folks who now have more skin in the game will then start taking policy matters and voting seriously

Then we move quickly away from trivial matters to what really matters ‎<This message was edited>

[5/11/24, 10:04:15 AM] Gary Teh: Coopercabruca the farming cooperative we are partnered with in Brazil charges an initial onboarding fee of USD500 and a yearly subscription fee USD50 on their members 

The sailing club I was part of back in the Silicon Valley charges a one time fee of USD1250 and then a monthly subscription fee of USD50

Their members take their membership very seriously 

I don’t see why we should not start doing the same now that DAO is advanced to the following 

- 2 proven revenue models

- ⁠on the cusp of IEO (_initial exchange offering_) for our governance tokens

[5/22/24, 1:30:40 PM] Iris - Community Manager: I sent him a message on Friday, 17th, it never got through
[5/22/24, 1:30:49 PM] Iris - Community Manager: I thought his phone isn't working
[5/22/24, 1:35:28 PM] Garis Pang: He always answered my call but this time round, I can sense something is not right. Can somebody in US report this matter to the local authorities to help search his whereabouts? (As I am from Singapore.)
[5/22/24, 1:36:24 PM] Iwona Fluda: His phone is actually on, just tried to call... so he might have been able to charge it. I will spread the word among my connections here.
[5/22/24, 1:38:52 PM] Iwona Fluda: I know that Gary goes sometimes to retreats and meditation sessions so this might be also the reason for him not being able to be in touch. @14153000019 - we are waiting here for you!
[5/22/24, 1:41:01 PM] Garis Pang: I am praying Gary doesn’t eat the wrong type of mushroom.

We’re looking for him for days!
Nobody has been able to reach him.

[5/22/24, 1:45:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: he was at the festival so it makes sense that he was off grid
[5/22/24, 1:45:58 PM] Suheil - Europe: festival finished officially 2 days ago so probably he stayed longer
[5/22/24, 1:46:07 PM] Suheil - Europe: we are getting into the light at the end of the tunnel
[5/22/24, 1:48:08 PM] Iwona Fluda: Thank you for sharing, I know that it is a stressful situation. And yes, I shared what I know for sure - that his phone is on and that I will spread the word about him among my US-based connections. Just having a call with one of them now, so lets see how she can help.
[5/22/24, 1:52:30 PM] Val Lapidus: Are you sure his phone is on? Or the phone number that you have is a Google voice number and will ring regardless
‎[5/22/24, 1:54:26 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[5/22/24, 1:54:46 PM] Val Lapidus: This is the last message I sent to Gary in WhatsApp.  Notice the one check mark. That means that the message was sent but not received by his phone.  If his phone were on he would have received the message
[5/22/24, 1:55:07 PM] Val Lapidus: And we would see a check mark
[5/22/24, 1:55:58 PM] Garis Pang: I called his mobile directly but no one answered.
[5/22/24, 1:56:08 PM] Val Lapidus: Garris what is his direct phone number?
[5/22/24, 1:56:09 PM] Garis Pang: It’s ringing and on
[5/22/24, 1:56:16 PM] Iris - Community Manager: Same as with my message
[5/22/24, 1:56:37 PM] Val Lapidus: Just because the phone rings doesn't mean that it's on
[5/22/24, 1:56:43 PM] Val Lapidus: But if you have his direct number that would help
[5/22/24, 2:00:09 PM] Iwona Fluda: Just have a call with my friend in California. One question: Does anyone have the registration plates number from his car? We can give them to the authorities to track the car down.
[5/22/24, 2:00:33 PM] Iwona Fluda: I will check it.
[5/22/24, 2:00:51 PM] Val Lapidus: The police already have the registration plates
[5/22/24, 2:01:02 PM] Val Lapidus: And they have Gary on the national missing persons list
[5/22/24, 2:03:00 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: This can happen if the phone is on but does not have access to internet too.
[5/22/24, 2:03:13 PM] Alessandro Mele: I just pray that Gary is doing nothing in the middle of nowhere and we will all have a huge laugh when he reconnects with us 🙏💙
[5/22/24, 2:03:56 PM] Val Lapidus: Let's put it a different way. Rather than suggesting his phone is on or off?  Let's just Agree that we don't know,  and let's concentrate on what the facts are
[5/22/24, 2:04:14 PM] Val Lapidus: The fact is I sent him a WhatsApp message and its status shows that it was sent but not received
[5/22/24, 2:04:34 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Cool.
[5/22/24, 3:08:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Wasn’t he in South America?

[5/22/24, 5:21:03 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished helping clean up the fairgrounds as a volunteer after three intense days of sales. (_help drive down operating cost of DAO_)

*Statistics*
- total attendees: 20000

- ⁠total samples served out: 200

- ⁠total number of bags from AGL2 contract sold: 25

- ⁠total sales proceeds from AGL2 contract: USD250

- ⁠total donation raised from attendees for drinks served out: USD12

- ⁠conversion rate: 12.5%

_PS: Unfortunately, that place had zero Internet reception and my car was helmed in by the other cars… so technically stuck._

_will be attending burning cow barter faire this weekend that is 2.5 hours east from here to try offload the rest of the cargo in my car_

_seems most of these barter faires happen in places with no internet. Please don’t freak out if I am not online for up to a week 🤔_
[5/22/24, 5:22:16 PM] Val Lapidus: 🙂. Thanks Garry great job
[5/23/24, 4:19:24 PM] Gary Teh: After doing some simple  mathematics, for our customer acquisition model to work, we need to successfully drive these folks that come and buy from us at these festivals/fairs to become repeat customers even when they are not at festivals/fairs 

This means they continue to

1. buy from us via our website 

2. ⁠call us directly to place an order

Our online content marketing strategy ends up playing the role of customer retention and content should be focused on the following 

1. How to consume our cacao in day-to-day life

2. ⁠When and where is our physical presence

3. ⁠ Updates regenerative efforts in the rainforest by our farmers

This also means that we are right now missing some marketing collaterals that should be present at our physical booths

- name cards 
- ⁠brochures ‎<This message was edited>
[5/23/24, 4:32:52 PM] Gary Teh: Once I finish my meeting with the market makers introduced by Craig from LaTokens, I will surface a proposal on the yearly taxation amount 🙂🙏
[5/24/24, 3:43:42 AM] Gary Teh: Typo error in statistics

- total attendees: 2000
- ⁠total samples served: 200
- ⁠total bags sold: 25
- ⁠samples to sales: 12.5%
- ⁠attendees to sales: 1.25%

*next steps*

1. measure if conversion rate remains the same across different festivals 

2. determine if sales at physical booth translates to online sales and if it is recurring 

3. determine if recurring sales happen online how often and how much 

_PS: Once we know statistics for 1-3, we will get a sense of the full operating model for @120363044028036610@g.us when we start scaling it_ ‎<This message was edited>

[6/3/24, 4:08:27 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes consulting my dad this evening about the cargo shipment protocol for the enterprise level deliveries he followed for the roasted poultry distribution business back in Singapore.

*_Key points*_
- down payment is required prior to assembling of cargo

- ⁠contact information

- ⁠to make call to ascertain counter party is present at premises prior to cargo delivery

_PS: once again he reminded me of 3 principles passed down from grandfather, who himself ran a pork import and distribution operation across Singapore._

- _a counter party must immediately be dropped as soon as concerns of integrity arises so as to prevent unnecessary financial losses_

- _quickly and cheaply ascertain the integrity of the counter party instead of delaying activities until deal size gets too large_

- ⁠_integrity is way more valuable than profitability. When forced to choose between one, always default to integrity_ ‎<This message was edited>
[6/4/24, 9:01:06 PM] Gary Teh: If no one is administrating the Edgar channel anymore and there’s no way at all to remove it from our DAO WhatsApp channels let’s just treated as a dead cell (_in cryptocurrency terms burnt_)

Moving forward DAO will only have six active channels, this will help DAO members to become even more hyper focused 🙂🙏

[6/16/24, 6:43:44 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
start monitoring our Telegram group for contributor submissions. I am aware that WhatsApp is considered personal where some folks communicate with their immediate family members on and most are keen to receive flood of messages from strangers
‎OPTION: Let’s do it. Allow for a larger more informal community to gather, communicate and contribute (4 votes)
‎OPTION: Too many channels. Let’s just forget about it (0 votes)
[6/16/24, 6:43:54 PM] <ops> The Town Hall: ‎You pinned a message
[6/16/24, 6:45:09 PM] Iwona Fluda: The argument for Telegram would be that you can read the past messages. I feel like everywhere we receive a flood of messages from strangers.
[6/16/24, 6:45:15 PM] Gary Teh: If this passes for all future events where we discuss about TrueSight DAO in general to the public, enthusiasts who might or might not be ready to contribute  will be directed to the Telegram channel and to just hang out there and passively observe 

They will only be invited into our WhatsApp channels where more formal communications are held within DAO. That’s if and only if they _*pass the bar_* and become serious and consistent about contributing

This also means that there will be a phase of pruning in our DAO WhatsApp channels where disinvite folks therein who have clearly exhibited no desire to actually contribute to DAO mission

_PS: Decentralized management does not equate informal_

_I would even argue that since management is decentralized, protocol to followed needs to be even more well defined and thus very formal… perhaps almost at the level of the samurais who practice the code of Bushido_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/21/24, 2:32:21 PM] Gary Teh: *New proposal surfaced for voting*

It’s observed that it is unintuitive and effortful for DAO members to vote on Gas Fee that should be charged for utility provided by DAO projects. Hence DAO Gas fee often remains static and outdated and none-reflective of actual market circumstances.

_Proposed solution_
Gas fee be calculated based on the following formula

_The higher of the two values_

- *Value 1*: Current 1 Month Treasury Yield:
Sample view: https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/xml?data=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2024

- ⁠*Value 2*: USDT1 - Last Price in USDT of TDG traded on LATOKEN exchange

Based on numbers today, DAO will be charging 42% for gas fee.

Higher of 5.5 versus 42% ‎<This message was edited>
[7/22/24, 11:18:08 AM] Tiffine Wang: That’s insane
[7/22/24, 11:18:24 AM] Tiffine Wang: Is that even viable ?
[7/22/24, 11:36:05 AM] Gary Teh: That is a good question 

It might. We will find out soon enough 🤩🙏

But it becomes a very equitable way to split profit between financiers and DAO operators for the @120363044028036610@g.us shipment 

What I noticed right now is the gas fee charged for the @120363044028036610@g.us is so low, monetary incentive for DAO members to contribute is low

We are mainly relying on altruistic motivations. However that is quite flimsy if push comes to shove when schedule clashes with their full-time job schedule ‎<This message was edited>
[7/22/24, 1:26:37 PM] Gary Teh: With this a new gas fee structure, the volume of revenue generated should help boost the value of the tokens

It will facilitate market making purposes

[8/8/24, 4:48:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: too many “ i spent 2 hours “ ect ect ect on telegram group.

So if Truesight had a hole in the bucket , i think it is just getting bigger.

[8/8/24, 12:26:08 PM] Gary Teh: You do know that tokenization of chat logs on all channels is not just 100% automated right

One of the governors still needs to review the output of the AI after it’s done scoring 

If someone submits some bullshit report and it passes through the filter of the AI, the governor was to block it at the end of the day because it’s a bullshit submission
[8/8/24, 1:28:26 PM] Suheil - Europe: Ya buts it's 5 min here 5 min there which governor will monitor that 🤷‍♂️
[8/8/24, 1:51:25 PM] Gary Teh: Dude, obviously you haven’t been checking the post in our channels for the past few quarters

The AI compiles it into a CSV file and then uploaded as a Google sheet 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPBMb7xXt8lTlt3_FkD4KftOE1wa5BGpPd0cr7tgcf4/edit

All the government needs to do is just filter out the rows with zero TDG indicated and just look at the ones with contributions and TDG associated
[8/8/24, 1:52:20 PM] Suheil - Europe: Yes I know brother.

Even in the excel the 5min there and here wtever x or y . Who will legitimize it ?!??!!?!
[8/8/24, 1:54:10 PM] Gary Teh: Check there is the logs brother 

If someone claims something, then filter for his name to see the proof of work associated 

This is mircotasking automation
[8/8/24, 1:54:51 PM] Gary Teh: Alternatively add an additional rule to chatgpt and ask it to check log history to verify it the submission is reasonable
[8/8/24, 1:55:41 PM] Suheil - Europe: Ok anyways I am a true believer of shutting up until I got something better to submit.

So I will do that for now. Thanks for your patience dealing with my arguments 🙏

[9/11/24, 3:54:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: Hey everyone.

After a long while of discovering and ping pongs (specifically me annoying gary) of figuring out how to help more efficiently in this environment. 

After months of pitching and nagging over every bit of my personal network and beyond.  succeeded to reach a good potential result.

At this stage I would need assistance into refining the deal for it to be accepted by the consensus of the members here.

Proposal :
 Partnership with non profit tech lab
How? 
They can subsidize the hiring of junior talent from tech and business fields

Up to 15k eur per talent

This was drawn under a deal that we called it " the de risking of hiring juniors "

The aim behind this deal is to up skill talent and job creations for Palestinians in Jerusalem (one of the very few totally unserved communities of the world) 

To conclude : we have access to budget to help talent contribute into our eco system
 

What you think ? 
@14153000019 ready for your awesome "ankered "  efficient responses 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[9/11/24, 3:56:25 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. Have the intern upgrade Edgar from Ruby 2.6.5 to Ruby 3.0 🤩🙏

[9/11/24, 3:57:49 PM] Gary Teh: 3. Have them reach out to manufacture/retailer/grocery/convenience store buyers in USA and have them buy our cacao produce via drop shipping

[9/12/24, 10:15:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.
