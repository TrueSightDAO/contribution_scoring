[12/14/23, 7:30:36 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just focus on personal money management (_and perhaps Edgar the engine as and when relevant…_)

AI has a way much larger and very different scope that really belongs somewhere else 

Here is more focused on learning to manage your money 

Feel free to lobby for a new channel for AI in Townhall if you will 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/14/23, 7:33:24 AM] Gary Teh: Will share more on Monday about the discussion format I have in mind which I saw being utilized very effectively within the working groups while I was at the zen monastery during my 21 days there ‎<This message was edited>

[12/15/23, 10:33:40 AM] Gary Teh: *Statement for the week*

What is money to you?
[12/15/23, 6:16:12 PM] Arti - Berkeley: That's a question though, not a statement 😛
But I think I see money as a modification to the age old adage of "it won't buy you happiness, but it's always better to have, than have not"
[12/15/23, 6:56:01 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Money is standarized value to create pairs and provide better correlations
[12/15/23, 7:09:53 PM] Gary Teh: Let me rephrase the question what is the thing that money represents to you personally that if you have it you don’t need money?
[12/15/23, 7:10:37 PM] Gary Teh: To me money means freedom and autonomy 

If I have those I don’t need money
[12/15/23, 7:10:44 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s try again
[12/15/23, 8:52:14 PM] Gary Teh: The reason why I started with this question is that it ties to personal emotions regulation when throwing your money around
[12/16/23, 6:06:06 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Ok let's try again. Money is the energy needed move things that are not in my control
[12/16/23, 10:37:34 AM] Anupa/diya: Money is a flow, either abundant or restrict. One has the ability to navigate the flow of how it will work for them
[12/16/23, 10:37:43 AM] Anupa/diya: That's how it works for me
[12/16/23, 10:51:18 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: First of all hello guys!

Money in it's most basic form is stored energy. 
There will be always some form of money for that reason. This makes the second part of the question redundant.
I appreciate the freedom and autonomy, too.
[12/18/23, 1:44:38 AM] Gary Teh: What is your deepest desire when you are given this energy?
[12/18/23, 1:45:02 AM] Gary Teh: What kind of flow would you like to experience for yourself?

[12/18/23, 2:32:37 AM] Gary Teh: Here is another way I look at energy. 

I was chatting with Youna this morning that after looking at my personal historical performance records there is really only one or two trades that made the bulk of my returns every year 

The rest of the trades might as well have happened in the @120363044542957540@g.us

This investment pattern is really starting to resemble the VC investment approach. Research 1000 companies and only invest in 2 every year

I think the call from her was very timely too. Almost like another signal from the universe 

Another advise from her was to step aside from the DAO. I was thinking through it just now during my drive south, it makes total sense. 

The DAO is going  to go through a phase centralization right now. The right profile to be leading it should be someone who has the following energetic qualities in his/her Bazi 

正官 - direct officer
正印 - direct authority 

None of these cosmic energies are part of my Bazi profile ‎<This message was edited>
[12/18/23, 2:41:39 AM] Gary Teh: Anyone keen to find out what is the set of cosmic energies the universe has granted you? 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/18/23, 8:12:08 AM] Gary Teh: Bulk of your wealth will be acquired via professional work. You will have the energy to pursue it too 正财+ 正官 + 七杀

The windfall that you attempt to go after will require some manner of effort  七杀 + 劫财

While you will be granted authority, there will always be cosmic elements that attempts to take away your authority. Expect to exercise your creativity to clear those huddles 正印 + 梟印

Friends will provide support occasionally 比肩

_PS: be careful about throwing money around in various investment opportunities, there is likelihood they be robbed. 劫财_

_consider leading a relatively well-defined project at some point. Your profile is well suited for that. 正财 正官 七杀_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/18/23, 10:03:13 AM] Gary Teh: You readings for this month shows 

Earth grants you official position 正官

Heaven will disrupt it 伤官
[12/18/23, 10:09:39 AM] Tomas - Offchain: 17th of may of 1981 7.13am
‎[12/18/23, 10:26:33 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/23, 10:34:10 AM] Gary Teh: _*Profile wise:_*

2X 正官 - direct officer 
2X 正财 - direct wealth 
2X 七杀 - seven killings 
2X 比肩 - friends 
2X 梟印 - diminished authority 
1X 伤官 - disruption to official position 
1X 偏财 - windfall 

*_Analysis_*
Even if you are granted an official job title. It will generally be an empty title with zero authority

You will make the bulk of your money working for someone else  

Use your cosmic drive to work for someone else. You can attempt to start ventures but don’t expect to eventually lead it. It is not in your profile to do so, so why the unnecessary striving??

Friends will come to your aid when you need help

You will experience occasional windfalls but not much. Don’t expect much returns from your trading activities
[12/18/23, 6:56:51 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Does that mean I will get a position but someone will take it away? 😂

[12/18/23, 8:04:29 PM] Anupa/diya: What is the purpose of this group. Are we generally speaking about money or are we looking at the edgar website?
[12/18/23, 8:06:17 PM] Anupa/diya: There is a friend who is working on personas who are affected by energies vibes. She is looking into building a process methodology for services and products which will use vibe energy.
[12/18/23, 8:07:02 PM] Anupa/diya: For we using edgar as a basis then we can ask her
[12/18/23, 9:04:46 PM] Gary Teh: It’s all interconnected 

Before we talk about trading it is important to deeply understand our own psychology, strengths and weaknesses 

Otherwise we will just misfire when we trade

[12/19/23, 5:46:47 AM] Anupa/diya: She will be free in jan onwards.  We should chat with her
[12/19/23, 10:17:50 AM] Gary Teh: *Configuration*

- 4X 正财 - make money from working in a job
- ⁠3X 伤官 - hurting officer 
- ⁠2X 正官 - direct officer 
- ⁠2X 劫财 - Rob wealth
- ⁠1X 梟印 - diminished authority 
- ⁠1X 七杀 - seven killings

*Analysis*
- you will make a lot more money holding a full time job or undertaking operational duties of any sort. But It is going to be a frustrating endeavor 4X 正财， 3X伤官 versus 2X 正官 

- ⁠however even if you tried, you will not be granted any autonomy or authority to make any important decisions on behalf of the organization. You will end up experiencing more frustration. 梟印

- ⁠don’t share too much about your money making strategies, your wealth will for sure get robbed 劫财

- ⁠you have some drive but not a lot, try to automate as much as possible your professional efforts otherwise you will run out of steam eventually 七杀

- ⁠doesn’t show any signs you will get a lot of unexpected windfalls in your life

But this month expect some from your friends… merry Xmas!?! ‎<This message was edited>

[12/19/23, 5:23:45 PM] Anupa/diya: If we are looking at ourselves as a pivot point. We got just map it out 

What is money to us . How to we explore money. What are behavioral actions related to money. 

What is the idea of digital money. How do we Interact. What is the relationship we have with it..
[12/19/23, 5:24:11 PM] Anupa/diya: Please edit or add any questions
[12/19/23, 5:24:24 PM] Anupa/diya: We can attempt this via word or micro
[12/19/23, 5:24:39 PM] Anupa/diya: Miro or figma
[12/19/23, 5:26:56 PM] Anupa/diya: After this stage, I propose we analyze general past and current money values, behaviors etc of people so we can narrow in on the potential user group.

We should also analyze the current edgar to see what we have now. @14153000019 can you please share that youtube video which you were explaining the site to me
[12/19/23, 5:28:03 PM] Anupa/diya: If anyone wants to propose any additional inputs please go out
[12/19/23, 5:28:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Please document what we are doing on a collective boarding so a. We have it recorded and we also minimize the use of the WhatsApp group
[12/19/23, 5:42:36 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Are we going to use other cosmology?

[12/19/23, 5:55:03 PM] Gary Teh: Actually might make sense.

Astrological natal chart??
[12/19/23, 5:55:37 PM] Gary Teh: I have been using AI to deeply interprete all the states from the Bazi system by the way
[12/19/23, 5:56:59 PM] Gary Teh: System is actually down right now. 🤣

Also Throwing them into the system right now will just totally bias the discovery process of how regular people think when it comes to trading 

We can show the video once we are done with the discovery process ‎<This message was edited>
[12/19/23, 5:58:08 PM] Gary Teh: Right now it’s more valuable and insightful to allow this experience to gradually unfold so that we can keenly understand how normal human psychology and behavior is like when it comes to money management. 

As much as it is a discovery process of what the end product and its functionalities might look like it is also a journey of self discovery for participants

For all we know by the end of this discovery journey participants might come to realize they actually don’t to involve themselves with trading or perhaps there is actually no need for such a system as Edgar ‎<This message was edited>

[12/19/23, 6:04:03 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes this is just for discovery process. I am sure what we design eventually will be different
[12/19/23, 6:07:51 PM] Anupa/diya: Just to get started. We have build a structure
[12/19/23, 6:08:01 PM] Anupa/diya: To direct where this is going
[12/20/23, 6:19:51 PM] Gary Teh: What do you suggest?
[12/21/23, 7:40:54 AM] Gary Teh: Thanks for speaking into the circle this past week everybody. 🙂🙏
[12/21/23, 7:42:00 AM] Gary Teh: *for discussion this week*

When did you first started investing? 

what triggered you? 

How much did you started with?
[12/21/23, 7:42:14 AM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[12/21/23, 8:01:31 AM] Anupa/diya: The structure that I proposed on top. I can add the discussion of the week on to a miro and every one can post on the board making it lighter on WhatsApp
[12/21/23, 8:02:46 AM] Gary Teh: My journey started in 2010. 

The insurance agent whom my dad bought a policy for me from came to visit one day and asked if I wanted to continue it now that I was generating my own income from doing consulting

The implication was I will need to start paying the monthly instead of my dad.

I did not personally belief in the concept of insurance and still don’t today. I strongly believe as in the tradition of Socrates and Seneca, if the body is to fail to such an extend it can no longer function properly, the best antidote is a bullet through the head to immediately end unnecessary continued suffering 

Also I do not belief in the concept of retirement where you work very hard to save a lot so that you can pay USD5000 per month to a nursing home when you grow old so that they could provide personal care giving to you till you die 

_Gentle Reminder: this is my personal beliefs, it is not stated for the purpose of converting you to my belief system. And neither should you seek to convert someone else to your own personal belief system._

_during discussions within this channel be *self focused* and also respect other people’s autonomy_

_if anything, this statement should help shed some light in why a person would seek to manage his money the way he does_

All that said, I ended up cashing out USD50k after canceling the insurance policy my dad had painstakingly build up over 24 years. I observed he felt disappointed with my decision 

First thing he did after I cashed out was his advice that the money not be just kept in my bank account as it is considered *dead money*. 

Rather it be deployed to investments. He recommended that the money be invested to this one company that he has been watching. I handed him USD2000 for management. 

He mentioned it is such a small amount but proceeded to anyways 

USD2000 became USD1000 per quickly 🤣

That was when I realized I couldn’t really trust him with my money. That was when I started buying books about investing. Fortunately my background in accounting was helpful

However considering my total networth now to my total networth back then, I don’t really consider myself to be much of a success financial investing wise. The cash level is almost exactly the same amount after 15 years. 

The primary difference is I got to really taste a lot of life in between now and then. Autonomy above all else. 🤩

I am still puzzled why external observers just keep considering me to be a rich person that can invest in their project? 🤔

The reason why I can do what I do is because I made very very deliberate trade offs money wise. 

I deliberately choose to be homeless

the amount of cash I provide my daughter with every month is way less than what my ex-girlfriend and her parents provides. 

She too was operating under the same mistaken belief despite ample warning from me prior to her getting pregnant. 

Seems she finally came to her senses after the financial models came into effect post pregnancy.

Last time we met she mentioned that she is always short on cash at the end of every month and can’t even afford rent a place for herself. 

Part of the reason why she is staying with her parents which is blessing in disguise. Since you now have three adults taking care of a child instead of two had she stuck around in Bay Area ‎<This message was edited>
[12/21/23, 8:04:19 AM] Gary Teh: Does Miro have a nice mobile app? 

I am trying to stay away from using my MacBook

The whiplash injury from my car accident in 2021 is still lingering so too much time spent in front of the MacBook just causes my whole body to become numb from neck downwards 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/21/23, 7:26:02 PM] Anupa/diya: My investment journey is very traditional some stocks and some financial plans . Nothing exciting
[12/22/23, 8:40:05 AM] Tomas - Offchain: my investing journey started during the pandemic when i was studying crypto and working as a director for a us company. Did a mess and burned 25k while trying to study how things were. made beg earnings during periods but found that it was a really stressful activity and it needed you to be hyper connect to news and information.
[12/22/23, 9:04:22 AM] Gary Teh: How did you first started?
[12/22/23, 9:04:48 AM] Gary Teh: Nothing is boring 

How did you first started?
[12/22/23, 9:05:31 AM] Gary Teh: What was the key mistake you made that caused the mess?
[12/22/23, 9:09:10 AM] Arti - Berkeley: The internet, I saw online how putting money in the bank was a waste and it's better to invest
[12/22/23, 9:09:35 AM] Gary Teh: And what was the next step that you took?
[12/22/23, 9:10:59 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Downloaded Robinhood, talked to my bank, purchased bonds to start out
[12/22/23, 9:52:10 AM] Tomas - Offchain: key mistake was thinking money had no value and paying to know different ways on how to get ripped
[12/22/23, 10:14:38 AM] Gary Teh: How did you first started studying crypto?
[12/22/23, 10:14:56 AM] Gary Teh: What lead you to purchase the bond?
[12/22/23, 10:20:45 AM] Tomas - Offchain: i started studying about smart contracts and daos as i found they were something new with a huge potential. Reading every white paper i could and participating in more than 100 projects
[12/22/23, 10:26:53 AM] Gary Teh: What was your initial investment?
[12/22/23, 10:27:43 AM] Tomas - Offchain: hmmmm... probably ethereum and btc
[12/22/23, 10:27:57 AM] Tomas - Offchain: then games and other new projects
[12/22/23, 10:28:00 AM] Tomas - Offchain: chia, etc
[12/22/23, 10:33:21 AM] Gary Teh: What got you convinced initially to part with your cash?
[12/22/23, 10:35:14 AM] Tomas - Offchain: i was getting paid in crypto and i think the idea of money was kind of blurry
[12/22/23, 10:35:21 AM] Tomas - Offchain: easy to put in other cryptos
[12/22/23, 10:35:57 AM] Gary Teh: USDT?
[12/22/23, 10:38:22 AM] Tomas - Offchain: yes
[12/22/23, 10:39:15 AM] Gary Teh: How did you go about sourcing for these and then evaluating them?
[12/22/23, 12:14:02 PM] Tomas - Offchain: communities mostly
[12/22/23, 12:17:45 PM] Gary Teh: How do you discover these communities? 

And what are the signals that you monitor for in these communities?
[12/22/23, 12:26:03 PM] Tomas - Offchain: telegram, discord and specialized websites… signals on volume, transactions, and other indicators
[12/22/23, 12:37:14 PM] Gary Teh: How do you first discovery a telegram, discord or specialized website exist?
[12/22/23, 12:57:26 PM] Tomas - Offchain: research
[12/22/23, 1:00:18 PM] Gary Teh: Care to elaborate what your research process is?
[12/22/23, 1:04:42 PM] Tomas - Offchain: google + google + google
[12/22/23, 1:11:49 PM] Gary Teh: How did you first discover the keywords to search with?
[12/22/23, 2:31:50 PM] Tomas - Offchain: i guess i needed to learn how the dynamics worked in that space. how the launch pad worked and then how to track early projects and connect with their developers and communities
[12/22/23, 2:54:30 PM] Felix Crypto Quant: for me its Twitter + Twitter + Twitter
[12/22/23, 2:55:08 PM] Tomas - Offchain: true!
[12/22/23, 3:01:45 PM] Gary Teh: Which hashtags were you following?
[12/22/23, 3:23:13 PM] Felix Crypto Quant: No hashtags just build a good feed over the years and I'm in some "whale groups"
[12/22/23, 3:23:34 PM] Gary Teh: Nice!! By following specific people?
[12/22/23, 3:25:07 PM] Felix Crypto Quant: yes exactly and with the help of the Twitter algo😂
[12/22/23, 3:27:18 PM] Gary Teh: I see. And what are the different approaches you use to analyze what they tweet about?
[12/22/23, 3:29:55 PM] Felix Crypto Quant: Narratives. Currently im interested in Solana and bitcoin ecosystem. Some weeks before it was AI coins. Just going with the flow
[12/22/23, 3:30:16 PM] Gary Teh: Narratives around specific Keywords? ‎<This message was edited>
[12/22/23, 3:31:06 PM] Gary Teh: What is you Twitter handle I am curious

[12/22/23, 3:32:29 PM] Felix Crypto Quant: just topics in general
[12/22/23, 3:37:43 PM] Gary Teh: Ok.
[12/22/23, 5:54:25 PM] Arti - Berkeley: It's the most low risk
[12/22/23, 5:54:58 PM] Arti - Berkeley: I am not an aggressive investor
[12/22/23, 5:56:05 PM] Gary Teh: How did you choose your bond?
[12/22/23, 6:01:35 PM] Arti - Berkeley: No particular reason
[12/22/23, 6:01:42 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Randomly
[12/22/23, 6:01:53 PM] Arti - Berkeley: What exactly is the point of all these questions?
[12/22/23, 6:04:03 PM] Gary Teh: Getting visibility on how everyone’s psychology, predisposition and behavior is when it comes to investing. 

And then once we known we can more easily exchange ideas

Otherwise we might as well be 5 different people speaking 5 different languages. Then conversations are not insightful/useful for anyone involved ‎<This message was edited>
[12/22/23, 6:06:36 PM] Gary Teh: For example right now when I say, I will be going all in on Singtel a company traded on the Singapore Stock exchange I already know for sure it’s going to be irrelevant for everyone in this chatroom

If I say something insightful about crypto, I know it might be useful for @5491125130580 and @4915759649730 

But whatever I say about any individual asset is probably not going to be useful for @918017107841 and @16146418370 

The demographics are so different

My sense is as we continue exploring questions we will at some point chance upon something that will be useful and relevant for all 5 of us

Otherwise what will likely occur is that this ends up becoming another dead channel

Since the number of participants in this channel is small, we have the opportunity to go really deep into any investment related subject once we discover ones that we all have a common interest in 

Then perhaps after that occurs, we can then source for tools to facilitate to further deepen our exploration in our organically discovered common topic of interest ‎<This message was edited>
[12/22/23, 6:10:49 PM] Gary Teh: @16146418370 does that answer your question?
[12/22/23, 6:12:14 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Yep, makes sense ☺️

[12/22/23, 6:14:10 PM] Gary Teh: Back to the question how did you discover the bonds you eventually invested in? 🙂🙏
[12/22/23, 6:17:22 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Honestly don't have a process, Googled, was the first result, read some reviews online, put my money in it
[12/22/23, 6:18:19 PM] Gary Teh: What keyword did you use when searching on Google? 

Your answer is going to be very insightful 🙂🙏
[12/22/23, 6:19:16 PM] Arti - Berkeley: I genuinely don't remember
[12/22/23, 6:19:20 PM] Arti - Berkeley: It's been a while
[12/22/23, 6:20:57 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Probably federal bonds
[12/22/23, 6:25:59 PM] Gary Teh: Thank you for the insight. 🙂🙏
[12/27/23, 9:12:08 PM] Gary Teh: *for discussion this week*

How did it felt like when you experienced your very first substantial monetary loss through your investment activities?
[12/27/23, 9:12:20 PM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[12/27/23, 9:41:17 PM] Gary Teh: The first time I experienced my major set back was during the 2015 oil crisis 

I had saved up a substantial amount of cash (_more than USD100K_) from the salary paid out while I was working as an engineer 

I had it sitting around in the bank not sure what to do with it. And cash just kept on piling up every month 

Ex-colleagues advised to just put it in alibaba when he realized how much cash I had piled up idle 

Not having much conviction I just parked it all in BABA at USD90. Unfortunately it tanked to USD80 and I exited with a 10% capital loss 🤣

That was when I created the first draft of Edgar and identified a few companies with high dividend payout ratios. A bunch of them were MLP (_master limited partnerships_) in the oil industry as well as Mortgage REITs

I spent time doing my research and then move the bulk of my capital over to Breitburn MLP 

Unfortunately the timing was bad. Saudi Arabia decided to flood the oil market to kill off the entire booming shale oil industry in the U.S. 

Breitburn had too much leverage and went bankrupt. I stumbled into a typical value trap. I saw my entire position wiped out within two months 😱

The typical sensation was dread and interspersed mixed with feelings of hope as and when share prices recovered 

I further employed dollar cost averaging on this position for an additional 3 months. Totally lost amount to USD130K 🤦‍♂️

And then figured I should just throw in the towel and stop the dollar cost averaging tactic chasing bad money with good money 

At the same time, it was year holidays, I was on a road trip vacation from SF to yellow stone park. What was supposed to be an enjoyable distraction from the financial losses just turned into a very horrible experience. 

I was in a romantic relationship then. And my ex was along with me for the road trip 

somehow for unknown reasons, through the bulk of my adult life, perfectly happy being single and without deliberately trying to get involved with anyone, very high maintenance womenfolk tend to gravitate towards me. My ex during that trip was one of them. Working as a software engineer and being perceived as a cash cow by default probably didn’t help with the problem too 🤔

Here I was just trying to avoid having the bank account balance hit zero and there she was bumping up the expense level because of the general material needs associated with high maintenance profile. She will end up blowing up in anger when her material expectations are not met. It was really really stressful.  🤣

*PS: lessons learned*
 
- best to be single if you are going to be adventurous with your money. Somehow relationship partners will always want a say in how you throw your cash around even though the cash is not technically theirs

- ⁠don’t get involved with high maintenance partners or partners who are going to be relying on you financially if you plan to be financially adventurous (_one of the nomads was exclaiming loudly around the campfire during Xmas why I was still single despite having such an impressive blah blah blah credentials… which I tried to keep under wraps but it somehow leaked thanks to some other nosy dude who went and check my profile online for god knows why… 🤦‍♂️ … my response to her… “I am autistic”,  smiled showed her the peace sign and then walked away to go clean the dirty dishes for the camp 🤣_)

- ⁠cut losses early 

- ⁠stop believing in narratives once its been invalidated to avoid the value trap

- ⁠don’t blindly follow dollar averaging strategy

- ⁠what is labeled as stress is a set of physical sensation that will soon pass. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/28/23, 3:04:05 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: Can relate😅
[12/28/23, 3:10:17 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: Had some big losses, but never went negativ in my PnL. For me the 1st big loss was giving back almost all profits I made in 2017. Lost around 100k with 18 over some months, just because I wouldn't listen to the market and kept risk on although the market clearly was giving risk off signals.

Lessons: 
-Put profits aside 
-Adapt to the market

The current format that we are following right now is that we elect one question per week and we share our personal experience about it

If we don’t feel comfortable about sharing. We just simply let it pass and wait for next week’s question ‎<This message was edited>
[12/29/23, 11:30:56 PM] Gary Teh: This weeks question is as follows 

*for discussion this week*

How did it felt like when you experienced your very first substantial monetary loss through your investment activities?
[12/29/23, 11:37:50 PM] Gary Teh: Since we are discussing very personal matters in this chat, *_Money_* which is usually tied to *_personal psychology*_ and perhaps even *_trade secrets*_, I would like to propose that we follow the communication guidelines of the San Francisco center for our discussions conducted here in this chatroom whenever the recommendations are applicable 🙂🙏

What is your investment thesis?

An investment thesis is an _insight_ you have about the world that is not common knowledge that you are basing your money management strategy on
[1/11/24, 3:03:40 AM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[1/11/24, 3:11:22 AM] Anupa/diya: Rely on your investment manager 🤣
[1/11/24, 3:11:23 AM] Gary Teh: _Key insights_ 

- human behavior is hard to acquire

- ⁠human behavior once acquired is hard to drop

- ⁠network effects is self reinforcing human behavior that has gained mass adoption 

- ⁠as a financial analyst, network effects is very hard to financially model. Hence most of these financial models are generally inaccurate  

- ⁠market sentiment tends to severely underprice business models with very strong inherent network effects during extended periods of bad news cycles 

- ⁠severe market mispricing tend to occur at least once or twice a year across an entire bundle of network effects based business models

- ⁠with a relatively modest sum of capital and with extreme levels of operating overheads management, one could technically arbitrage on each wave of mispricing to cover all ongoing expenses ‎<This message was edited>

[1/11/24, 3:21:04 AM] Anupa/diya: If we look at factual, not everyone will wait for insights to come to them. This might be a great way to bring a service together where financial insights are easily accessed and understood
[1/11/24, 3:23:28 AM] Gary Teh: Once insight becomes common knowledge, there is no longer opportunity for arbitrage 

Please refrain from circulating insights shared in this channel with wider audiences 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/11/24, 3:26:06 AM] Anupa/diya: We are not at the stage of circulation 

I am guessing the purpose of this group is to build something that would aid financial insight. That is what I presumed

[1/11/24, 3:44:51 AM] Tomas - Offchain: I took one week to study the news and try to see some ripple effects and then do some bets, and it tend to work. But not really close of real (inside) info, so not great margins.
[1/11/24, 3:47:49 AM] Anupa/diya: How did you do your study ?
[1/11/24, 4:23:46 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Research online and after that lots of groups
[1/11/24, 4:23:54 AM] Tomas - Offchain: And then rug pull

[1/12/24, 5:14:03 AM] Tomas - Offchain: i guess that is a systemical way of thinking, if everything is connected is important just to find how and when. Having historical data and an interpreter could do the trick, that was the first thing i thought when we were talking about Edgar.

[1/26/24, 9:27:53 PM] Anupa/diya: If we are in on track with this . Let's look at some case studies
[1/26/24, 9:28:40 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's re visit and look at what we are trying to solve . What is the value with the users that we have now. Where could it work.
[1/27/24, 2:55:17 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Wonderful let’s do it! The way I see it Edgar can offer two lanes of services: 1. News and trends analysis 2. Economic, financial, investment and trading sentiment analysis.
[1/27/24, 10:39:59 AM] Tomas - Offchain: do we have an edgar whitepaper?

[1/29/24, 6:07:05 AM] Vlatko Gigov: This for the market reports…
[1/29/24, 6:14:44 AM] Tomas - Offchain: @41799155602 I can do a weekly article
[1/29/24, 6:15:11 AM] Tomas - Offchain: It might be something interesting to create traction
[1/29/24, 6:15:31 AM] Anupa/diya: We can invite people to write
[1/29/24, 6:17:25 AM] Vlatko Gigov: That would be wonderful. They way would be nice to do it is to continue the format Gary followed. Let’s say you decide on specific topics you want want Edgar to analyse and thereafter write the blog.
[1/29/24, 6:19:25 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I would suggest maybe to even draft a framework after some time for collaborative blog posts, let’s say around the topics of:
1. Politics - with edgars insights
2. ⁠technology - || -
3. ⁠finance - || -
4. ⁠…
5. ⁠…
6. ⁠…
7.
[1/29/24, 6:20:11 AM] Vlatko Gigov: And so on. The question now remains to have that unbiased approach in commenting edgards findings. 😃 I’m sure chatgpt can help a lot here…
[1/29/24, 6:20:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Should we create a LinkedIn account or even Twitter to get people to use the platform and then maybe write about it...
[1/29/24, 6:20:44 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Definitely…
[1/29/24, 6:21:04 AM] Anupa/diya: @5491125130580 you can be the face for this 🤣..

[1/29/24, 6:21:55 AM] Anupa/diya: @4915759649730 do you think people who trade will have the time for this? To read and follow.. or to participate
[1/29/24, 6:22:18 AM] Tomas - Offchain: I Was writing questions for university of ethereum weekly workshop so I thought that can relate
[1/29/24, 6:23:27 AM] Vlatko Gigov: More than applicable…
[1/29/24, 6:41:26 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: If it provides value to them, sure!
[1/29/24, 6:42:08 AM] Anupa/diya: If we circulate this idea in the group you were telling me about, do you think it will work with them ?

[1/31/24, 5:48:19 AM] Gary Teh: Actually no need to outsmart AI. 

The AIs will eventually become very good at being AIs, this will free the humans up to from all the mind boggling manual labor so that they can become very good at being humane.

[1/31/24, 8:14:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: We’ll just have to learn to live in that new reality. I predict in 2 years time humans will be the 4th or 5th on the ladder of internet/connectivity users…
[1/31/24, 8:16:52 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess Edgar’s task is to provide humans with clarity on the mutltiverse of truths out there - currently we are faced with psychographic targeting, covert reporting and fakes, imagine once the narrative will be controlled by ai, bots and ml…
[1/31/24, 8:18:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: 🧘‍♂️ that is why I am more and more inclining towards the “do nothing society” but before we get there I want to make sure I’ve tried at least to bring some clarity and understanding on the information pollution existing out there.
[1/31/24, 8:30:32 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps it’s precisely because of the clarity that is why people end up joining the @120363044542957540@g.us  🙂🙏

[2/2/24, 5:29:55 AM] Tomas - Offchain: i might not be able to make it but i can read whatever you discuss
[2/2/24, 3:43:21 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps surface a poll here? That makes it more structured 🙂🙏
[2/3/24, 5:34:08 AM] Anupa/diya: It's too many zones and dates. 🤣 let people interested give their suggestions and we can do a poll with the popular suggestions

[2/5/24, 1:48:04 PM] Gary Teh: Had a brief chat just now with @41799155602 where he talked briefly about Edgar 

Hopefully the document states the following clearly 

- WHO: needs it critically 
- ⁠WHY: do they need it  
- WHAT: does it do for them 
- ⁠HOW: does it work when they start using it
[2/5/24, 5:42:32 PM] Anupa/diya: Not really. The purpose of this document is not for us to do this. There is a sketchy outline taken from the white paper
[2/5/24, 5:43:01 PM] Anupa/diya: What the document outlines us the process methodology and next steps to move forward
[2/5/24, 5:44:44 PM] Anupa/diya: This has been partially established already. We need to go the research discovery phase to finalize what these points look. The current research is not adequate enough to support what we what to define
[2/5/24, 5:46:51 PM] Anupa/diya: Whether we stick to the given existing statements or redefine what the purpose and problem area is yet to be seen.
[2/5/24, 5:46:57 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. Will wait for both you and @41799155602 guidance on the way forward 🙂🙏
[2/5/24, 5:47:57 PM] Anupa/diya: I want it to be an open conversation because it will also show what kind of roles  and responsibilities the group wants to take
[2/5/24, 5:49:49 PM] Anupa/diya: I am also keen on taking forward the conversation we had with hans martin in taping into his resource pool for advisory roles as part of the purpose initiative
[2/5/24, 9:36:03 PM] Gary Teh: Purpose (_WHY_) naturally arises when there is a perceived Gap between Expectation and Reality 

Mission (WHAT and HOW) comes about when the perceived Gap is wide enough that motivation naturally arises to close the Gap. 

From my perspective, if there is sufficient large enough group of people right now experiencing dissatisfaction in how they expect their money to be managed and how it is right now being managed then there is a clear purpose for Edgar’s existence. 

If there is none, then WHY bother?? 🤔🤷‍♂️ ‎<This message was edited>
[2/5/24, 9:41:09 PM] Anupa/diya: That's one perspective. If you look at a quantitative and qualitative, we will have valid facts figures and insights to match what we are trying to solve.
[2/5/24, 9:41:57 PM] Anupa/diya: Who are these people. Arw they individuals, companies, investors, financial institutions
[2/5/24, 9:42:34 PM] Anupa/diya: We need to figure all that out

[2/6/24, 6:57:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya  we will be done by Friday for the open discussion to start
[2/6/24, 6:58:09 AM] Gary Teh: Is this problem what you feel absolutely passionate about and will be willing to devote the rest of the year working on on a daily basis?
[2/6/24, 7:00:50 AM] Anupa/diya: If the signals we send out, come back positive, the funding rolls in. Ya why not.
[2/6/24, 7:19:20 AM] Gary Teh: Folks please share what you feel is important for this chatroom and what role you would be keen to actively play over the next 90 days within the scope of what you have defined as important 

Please also feel free to leave if upon reflection you realize there is no active role you would be keen to play within the next 90 days

[2/6/24, 8:12:30 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. So what is the thesis that you have in mind and want to prove? 

And which demographic are you speaking to to validate your thesis?

Ideas are dime a dozen. Bulk of them not worth much as not of the nuts and bolts have been validated 🤔🤷‍♂️ ‎<This message was edited>

[2/6/24, 8:16:09 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: I would like to contribute, but at this point I don't really know what is planned to do. Just an improvement of the original Edgar?
[2/6/24, 8:16:42 AM] Felix Crypto Quant: Yes that sounds good to me too!
[2/6/24, 8:17:47 AM] Tomas - Offchain: I'm working on a telegram bot during my free time so it will be really good to do something similar here plus use the resources I have
[2/6/24, 8:18:44 AM] Anupa/diya: We can come up with some few ideas and see which one is the most feasible
[2/6/24, 8:19:27 AM] Anupa/diya: It's a take from there! It has a lot of potential. Please bear with us. By Friday we will send the one page
[2/6/24, 8:21:01 AM] Anupa/diya: A few companies are connecting there apps to WhatsApp and telegram and tracking customers engagement, automating tasks and responses. Lasitha is working on similar stuff

[3/14/24, 7:11:21 PM] Anupa/diya: We have spent some time shaping what we could do so let's see
[3/14/24, 7:24:10 PM] Gary Teh: After the meeting if there is a direction it is important you all go and get the direction of the incoming vote reversed
[3/14/24, 7:31:32 PM] Gary Teh: Otherwise as far as I know everyone other than myself that is currently in this channel will end up getting booted
[3/14/24, 8:18:18 PM] Anupa/diya: Hi Everyone ! Please refer to the post with the three options. Scroll up

The main agenda for Today. 
1. Pick one of the problem areas to solve 
2. Keep in mind that this is a four month pilot. See what is the most feasible that we can achieve 
3. What are the resources we need 
4. What role will you play in the execution
[3/15/24, 8:55:42 AM] Anupa/diya: See you all in 5 mins !

[3/15/24, 10:18:25 AM] Anupa/diya: So please add what you will achieve in the next two weeks
[3/15/24, 10:21:02 AM] Anupa/diya: Anupa _ UX with vlatko. I suggest that we create like a feature map with potential ui features. Arti it will be great if you can help suggest the outcomes depending on the features
[3/15/24, 10:21:28 AM] Anupa/diya: The feature map can be a collective exercise @5491125130580 you can add what you wanted to say about ui
[3/15/24, 10:22:20 AM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 you cant put the photo because Arti wasn't there. ! We are a group now

[3/15/24, 10:29:09 AM] Anupa/diya: Happy weekend everyone !!
[3/15/24, 10:31:27 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Sounds good, we can do a Google docs file or something
[3/15/24, 10:31:37 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya
[3/15/24, 10:32:38 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Also my GitHub is vedula9
[3/15/24, 10:32:56 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Feel free to share any source code with me here
[3/15/24, 10:33:16 AM] Anupa/diya: Did anyone take any notes
[3/15/24, 10:34:06 AM] Anupa/diya: Mostly no 🤣 there were some great points . We should also make a road map
[3/15/24, 10:36:20 AM] Anupa/diya: Can someone take this lead on that
[3/15/24, 10:36:30 AM] Anupa/diya: @41799155602 @5491125130580
[3/15/24, 10:41:52 AM] Vlatko Gigov: i took some notes on the final points, here they are:

[3/15/24, 10:49:36 AM] Arti - Berkeley: If there is any trading model existing code, I can take a look to understand it, that will take some time, before we talk about improvements
[3/15/24, 10:49:41 AM] Anupa/diya: We have finalized on the delivery and outcomes today . What we can do is once it is up for rollout we can see who wants to join in
[3/15/24, 10:50:04 AM] Anupa/diya: As phase 2
[3/15/24, 10:58:51 AM] Anupa/diya: Behavioral mapping is a research tool used to observe and record behaviors in a particular setting at a particular time.

 Behavioral mapping can be either place-based or individual-based, depending on whether the focus of observation is to identify locational or temporal patterns of behaviors.
[3/15/24, 10:59:41 AM] Anupa/diya: So this is what we need to users to do in terms of observing "insight"... maybe validate and record by submitting
[3/15/24, 11:01:55 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Btw what exactly is "insight"?
[3/15/24, 11:02:12 AM] Arti - Berkeley: How would you define it? To me, this is quite a vague term
[3/15/24, 11:02:42 AM] Anupa/diya: Good question. We discussed this before you came
[3/15/24, 11:03:00 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Gotcha, please give me this brief version
[3/15/24, 11:04:01 AM] Arti - Berkeley: That aside, I can think of a very simple approach, if "insight"=useful, reputation score+1, else, reputation+0-1
[3/15/24, 11:04:22 AM] Arti - Berkeley: We can improve on this, but this is a potential model that's easy to put up
[3/15/24, 11:04:42 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya this is similar to what we were saying
[3/15/24, 11:05:08 AM] Gary Teh: Hi @16146418370 These are two code bases that I have added you to

*Sentiment Importer*: 
Ruby on Rails application where map reduce is processed 

⁠Location of codebase: https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/sentiment_importer/
Live production environment: Edgar.TrueSight.me


*Sentiment*
Python code base where models are backtested, trained, validated and then deployed into production. It comes with a Jypter notebook as part of its codebase

[3/15/24, 11:07:05 AM] Gary Teh: She can just sign in with her Gmail
[3/15/24, 11:07:10 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Is the repo not public? I don't seem to be able to access it
[3/15/24, 11:07:13 AM] Gary Teh: anyone can do that.
[3/15/24, 11:07:15 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Could you double check
[3/15/24, 11:07:31 AM] Gary Teh: You need to accept the github invite before you can access that repo
[3/15/24, 11:07:49 AM] Gary Teh: The credentials to the production databases are therein.
[3/15/24, 11:07:57 AM] Gary Teh: we dont want those exposed to the public
[3/15/24, 11:08:35 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Ah I see it now
[3/15/24, 11:08:52 AM] Arti - Berkeley: I think it'd be nice to have a public, open source version people can suggest edits to
[3/15/24, 11:08:54 AM] Anupa/diya: What we were talking about in a very brief way 

Once the user adds a report or an insight ( people are buying Alexas as Christmas gifts) and submits it. They get a point 

Its neither useful or not ( like you suggested) 

These insights can be grouped by data or categories or region
[3/15/24, 11:09:02 AM] Anupa/diya: There will be a community aspect
[3/15/24, 11:09:24 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Yeah I can draw up a math model for this, let me think
[3/15/24, 11:09:42 AM] Anupa/diya: What's a math model
[3/15/24, 11:10:25 AM] Gary Teh: Right now there is a reversion to mean model active which generates the large dip reports

Once you have signed, let me upgrade your account to admin on Edgar. That way you can access all the admin interfaces
[3/15/24, 11:10:42 AM] Arti - Berkeley: @14153000019 I haven't looked closely, but sentiment seems like it could be useful for open source since it's only scraping
[3/15/24, 11:10:51 AM] Anupa/diya: @16146418370 since you know which way the design will go. Please suggest any thing that we need to think about for ux

[3/15/24, 11:11:43 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Basically, we're talking a mapping right, so f(x)=y
[3/15/24, 11:11:51 AM] Arti - Berkeley: And x is people, y will be value
[3/15/24, 11:11:55 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Now, f is idk what
[3/15/24, 11:12:05 AM] Anupa/diya: Ah ok !
[3/15/24, 11:13:04 AM] Gary Teh: Basically a bunch of models that are outdated that I havent used for a while and haven’t bothered to update

Sure, by all means
[3/15/24, 11:13:48 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Okay, let me know if there's any sensitive data that we don't want going public, otherwise I will just make sentiment open source
[3/15/24, 11:13:50 AM] Gary Teh: I just made you the Admin for sentiment

sentiment_importer has credentials tied directly to my trading account.
[3/15/24, 11:14:01 AM] Arti - Berkeley: Okay let's keep that private then
[3/15/24, 11:14:35 AM] Gary Teh: Go for it and make sentiment open source.
[3/15/24, 11:14:46 AM] Gary Teh: just keep sentiment_importer private

[6/29/24, 3:01:41 AM] Gary Teh: BABA is going to be heavily advantage by this

Already tree of the top 10 large language models in the wall on hugging face belong to Alibaba

BABA is selling at all-time historic low prices due to regulation concerns by Chinese government there was triggered when Jack Ma did not know how to keep his mouth shut a few years ago

Of the rebound of the pranks and the easing of the Real Estate crisis in China consumer should be recovering and with that more sales volume which will boost Alibaba profitability

Already it’s price at the lowest ever in terms of PE ratio, compared to the other major e-commerce platforms around the world

[9/22/24, 9:35:10 AM] Gary Teh: I noticed the concentration of conflict in the Middle East has gradually shifted from Gaza to Lebanon over the past 1.5 months 

https://edgar.truesight.me/compare/797-gaza,5714-lebanon/2024-09-22/90

Careful examination of headlines coming out of Gaza shows that Gaza is still happening 

https://edgar.truesight.me/covered_entities/797-gaza/2024-09-22

What could be inferred from this is the surface area where conflict is happening in the Middle East has expanded
[9/22/24, 10:16:01 AM] Gary Teh: The issue of concern then is how its impact on price of oil will be
[9/22/24, 10:17:02 AM] Edgar: ‎Only messages that mention @Meta AI are sent to Meta. Meta can't read any other messages in this chat. Some responses may be inaccurate or inappropriate.
[9/22/24, 10:17:02 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 what is the potential impact on price of oil if conflict between isreal and hamas expands beyond just Gaza and Lebanon? 

What are key redlines to watch out for in this conflict?
[9/22/24, 10:17:07 AM] Meta AI: The potential impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on oil prices depends on various factors, including:

1. Escalation and geographical spread: Conflict expansion beyond Gaza and Lebanon could disrupt oil production and transportation in the region.

2. Regional involvement: Involvement from countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Egypt could significantly impact oil production and prices.

3. Strait of Hormuz: Conflict spreading to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, could severely disrupt global oil supplies.

4. Global economic conditions: Oil price impact will also depend on existing global economic conditions and oil demand.

Key redlines to watch:

1. Attacks on oil infrastructure or shipping lanes.

2. Involvement of other regional countries.

3. Israeli strikes on Iranian territory.

4. Hamas attacks on Israeli cities or critical infrastructure.

Please note that predicting oil price fluctuations and conflict escalation is inherently uncertain. These factors are constantly evolving.

[9/22/24, 5:51:52 PM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 seems the two conflicts are really proxy war between isreal and Iran 

What is the likelihood of a head on conflict between isreal and Iran given the escalating proxy war between these two countries
[9/22/24, 5:51:57 PM] Meta AI: The Israel-Iran proxy war is a complex and sensitive issue. Assessing the likelihood of a direct conflict between Israel and Iran requires considering various factors:

*Factors increasing the likelihood:*

1. Escalating proxy wars: Intensifying conflicts in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq increase tensions.

2. Iranian nuclear program: Israel's concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and potential breakout capacity.

3. Border incidents: Skirmishes along Israel's northern border with Syria and Lebanon.

4. Naval confrontations: Confrontations between Israeli and Iranian naval forces in the Red Sea and Strait of Hormuz.

5. US-Iran relations: Tensions between the US and Iran, particularly regarding the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action).

*Factors reducing the likelihood:*

1. Mutual deterrence: Both sides understand the devastating consequences of a direct conflict.

2. Economic considerations: Iran's struggling economy and Israel's reliance on international trade.

3. Russian and Chinese influence: Both countries have interests in regional stability.

4. Diplomatic efforts: Ongoing attempts at dialogue, such as the Baghdad Conference.

*Likelihood assessment:*

- Direct conflict in the short term (6-12 months): Low to moderate (20-40%)
- Increased proxy wars and skirmishes: High (60-80%)
- Continued tensions and low-level conflicts: Very high (80-90%)

*Redlines to watch:*

1. Iranian nuclear advancements.

2. Major Israeli strikes on Iranian soil.

3. Significant Iranian-backed attacks on Israeli cities.

4. US or Russian intervention.

5. Miscalculations or unintended escalations.

Keep in mind that conflict dynamics are inherently unpredictable. These assessments are based on current information and may change.

[10/1/24, 3:29:41 AM] Gary Teh: LLM category AIs derive their outputs probabilistically as opposed to deterministically. Requiring that they do very *_specific step function Big Data computation*_ seems to yield results where more is to be desired 

From my perspective this is the technology and market gap where smaller companies with less resources can step in to fill up the gap with the deployment of LLMs in a very specific order tuned to very specific industrial needs 

It is an angle where larger technology companies with more resources going after the more generalized use case cannot cater to. hopefully by doing so these smaller companies can *_turn a profit*_ ‎<This message was edited>

[11/5/24, 9:59:16 AM] Gary Teh: Something I learned managing personal capital to generate income to sustain my personal expenses the past 6 years, the less I let whatever personal ideology I might harbor to get in the way of my capital deployment the better performing the return on investment.
[11/5/24, 11:17:37 AM] Arti - Berkeley: It's certainly easy to claim non partisanship when none of Project 2025s policies affect a person. It becomes harder to invest by removing personal feelings when decisions involve you personally.
