[11/14/23, 6:47:28 AM] Gary Teh: Main difference 

_*Legacy system*_ - you end up deferring to me on which category your contribution belongs to 🤣

*_New system_* - you submit how many hours your effort was and that gets tokenized 100TDG per hour. 

_*Primary similarities*_
In either case each task should not be above 5000TDG. Life goes on without me 

If it is. Break it down into smaller tasks

_*Key insights*_
A DAO member working full time for DAO 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and 4 weeks a month and 12 months per year ends up making exactly the same amount in TDG a software engineer working in Silicon Valley would in USD

So the rates are quite reasonable from my perspective. I see us all as system hackers 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

Finished facetime with @41799155602 

*Agenda*
    
_*Agroverse*_
    - Setting up of supply chain in Switzerland
    - Shipping of first 3kg cargo to Switzerland warehousing facility
    - Shipping of 2 bags samples to Switzerland

_*SunMint*_
    - role as owner of land.

    - role as issuer of carbon credits
    - role as validator of sustainable practise along supply chain
    - SunMint as node operator of TrueChain where notarization records for steps along the supply chain are stored

*Time Taken: 1 hour*
[11/15/23, 3:39:30 PM] Gary Teh: Closed out the following shipment financing contract for all financiers

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20231002%20-%20Export%20trade%20financing%20syndicate%20agreement%20.pdf

*Time Taken: 40  minutes*
[11/15/23, 5:07:11 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the outcome of this discussion is that I will end up spending sometime in Europe early next year as me and @41799155602 work together to setup the European section of our Agroverse supply chain network
[11/15/23, 5:21:59 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposed governance token management protocol*

The purpose of this protocol is to discourage excessive speculation on our governance tokens in the open market once it gets listed on Centralized exchanges while at the same time capitalize on market fluctuations to increased our fiat netbook value per issued governance token ratio



*_Rules_*
    - _*Rule 1*_: every quarter DAO will make provisions to increase governance tokens in circulation by 25% of what is already in circulation last day of the previous quarter. 

    - _*Rule 2*_: Full amount might not end up being circulated in the market if no exceptional price ranges present themselves 

    - _*Rule 3*_: DAO will make open market purchase as and when market value at which governance token is traded at falls below USDT net book value. 

    - _*Rule 4*_: DAO will make open market sales of governance tokens up to the total provision specified for market circulation as and when market value per token exceeds the minimal of either USDT1 or USDT net book value per token



*_Conclusion_* 
This protocol for governance token management when strictly adhered to in the long haul is anti-dilutive on nature. 

It has the effect of discouraging excessive speculation activities beyond desirable price range both on the upside and the downside 

The muting of speculative components in open market pricing of DAO governance token help curtail distractions DAO governance token holders might otherwise experience away from daily practice of Satseva

@918017107841 we should extend our website with a page that provides people with instructions on how they can transfer the USDT they receive into their bank account after they cash out 

Also perhaps a form on that page that allows people to insert their name, WhatsApp or email address and Solana wallet address they want their USDT to be transferred to once they have cashed out their governance tokens at the prevailing exchange rate

[11/17/23, 9:14:49 AM] Gary Teh: I spent time thinking about *_WHY*_ a *_chocolate artisan_* in the Agroverse network will not want to become their own importer if and when their own operations scale up

Fundamentally it boils down to fear of *_legal repercussions*_. 

Most of these folks will be mum and pop localized operations. 

If they decide to also handle importing as part of their operations if and when FDA does an audit and surface issues with the Agroverse supply chain into USA then they will be dragged into it and their mom and pop side of the business will suffer as well. 

In that regard TrueTech Inc is the *_ultimate underwriter of legal risk*_… or more specifically *_me*_. If anything ever happens regarding the Agroverse supply chain into USA, and someone needs to go to jail, that person will be me. And it will definitely not be the first time something like this happened before (_after being mistaken for being an insurgent in Xinjiang region of China_).  🤣

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/

For a person with a more conventional domestic arrangement like someone who has a family, such an experience will be very devastating to the rest of their family members if and then one of their family members get locked up in jail. 

However in my case, everyone in the immediate family is keenly aware of this natural inclination towards *_maximized calculated risk taking*_ in my DNA hence they won’t be devasted or even surprised if and when one of these usual exceptions occur. 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/23, 9:16:05 AM] Gary Teh: The other dimension as that a *_mom and pop*_ cannot easily replicate is the decentralized nature of the DAo community which makes it exceptionally suited for sourcing in unconventional locations in the world.

[11/22/23, 9:10:22 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposal to reduce noise on WhatsApp app and increase retention rate*

I noticed that there are quite a lot of folks who have not *_clicked in to visit any of our community WhatsApp channels for more than 90 days*_

From my perspective if a community member has churned, it doesn’t make any sense to keep _spamming_ their phone with messages they are obviously no longer interested in

Also now that we are allowing people to *_submit via our community WhatsApp channels USDT cash out requests for their TDG governance tokens held*_, this seem like a great opportunity to filter out folks who have churned for various reasons while at the same time gamify retention. 

This has the side effect of also making it more likely active community members get a response when they reach out to any of the remaining community members in our channel for help as the latter folks are obviously still interested to keep updated in matters regarding our DAO and be more inclined to help than folks who have already churned. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/23/23, 5:23:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: after a quick review of all documentation , here is my analysis why we are not ready  or should not list now.

1. requires 6-8k fiat budget (after effort and discount from our lovely contact at LA token )
2. true sight eco system becomes more vulnerable to idiot hackers. (just got hacked 2 weeks ago and hackers stole only tokens that are convertible fiat , did not touch utility tokens )  hence , let’s keep the true sight token as a utility token and internal cash out /cash in control until the eco system is less vulnerable 🤷
3. listing on exchange will require heavy routine legal operations/ reporting/ declarations aka  extra costs…

_PS: what I observe is the herd behavior tends to follow DAO members exercising personal *Autonomy* in executing critical functions in our DAO._

_After analyzing all the different functions, the most *critical ones* are_ 

    - _ledger update_ 
    - _fiat funding_
    - _supply chain management_

_If there is only one DAO member exercising *Autonomy* in any of these, then the DAO becomes centralized around that specific function_ ‎<This message was edited>

Actually if you are really keen on Slack you should just go ahead and revive this slack channel 🙂🙏
https://join.slack.com/t/truesight-group/shared_invite/zt-27r7rowr6-NBR58UmtHKNen2jBZRKq~A

Neil (DAO member and former engineering manager at Edmodo) set it up when he and his brother started working on some engineering related tasked. 

Richard was active on it as well when he was helping build out the frontend UI of Edgar. 

Gautam (_Technical staff contextual Ai_) was also hanging out in that channel when we were discussing how USA college students understood Metaverse as well as exploring various implementations of Zero Knowledge proofs on blockchain for the prediction market project from last year

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_LAioUeYvbSuuCuiPCd87t4VLx_PkqXBn3ggIn8Fxs/edit#heading=h.efqfwk7iwt0y 

From my perspective it might actually be easier to poll slack for messages to automate contribution tokenization than it is for WhatsApp. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/26/23, 7:26:01 PM] Gary Teh: *key constrains to consider*

    - slack charges after a certain number of people joins

   - slack does not allow access to historical messages older than 3 months without paying 

*_proposal for you if you are keen_*

Go ahead and start it as a side experiment with folks you work closely with. 

If it gains traction great. 

If not, it was a cheap experiment

[11/29/23, 4:06:46 PM] Iwona Fluda: Could we please make sure that all the people are informed about this changes? Also via other channels, like emails. To avoid the confusion like last time when people were deleted from channels and not even aware of such development. Thanks!

[11/29/23, 4:10:04 PM] Iwona Fluda: I mean writing to everyone a message like this before booting them out: 

Hi! We are developing super fast here & working on new community rules now. Please be informed of... XYZ & the consequences of not being active are... XYZ.
[11/29/23, 4:11:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: People have different reasons for not being much involved and the fact that they weren't over the last 3 months doesn't mean they wouldn't like to be involved in the future. A transparent communication on this change will help everyone.
[11/29/23, 4:12:16 PM] Iwona Fluda: and definitely will help in building long-term relationships with people.
[11/29/23, 4:12:39 PM] Gary Teh: The rules will have been published in the @120363044914723610@g.us channel 

Perhaps you might want to craft the copy when the policy gets published once the voting period for this incoming policy is over? 🙂🙏
[11/29/23, 4:13:27 PM] Gary Teh: That is true. 

Nothing preventing them from joining the @120363041505997891@g.us again since they are governance token holders
[11/29/23, 4:13:55 PM] Iwona Fluda: It is great that it has been published. I think we had this discussion once: How many of us read the Terms & Conditions of every community we are joining? I guess: none.
[11/29/23, 4:14:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Sending everyone an email or a message with this information before enforcing this decision will help people to rethink their involvement.
[11/29/23, 4:16:54 PM] Iwona Fluda: I'm not sure if that would be helpful. Once trust is broken, then is broken; not sure how many people would even consider coming back. 

Just speaking from experience as I have run private communities over the last few years, and everything there is based on trust and mutual understanding.
[11/29/23, 4:30:05 PM] Gary Teh: There is also the other perspective too

For folks who hasn’t been in these channels for a long time, sending them a direct message regarding something that they no longer care about will just come across as spam in their inbox
[11/29/23, 4:33:59 PM] Iwona Fluda: We don't know if they don't care about it. Depending on the message it can be also taken as a great reminder to them that it exists.
[11/29/23, 4:34:43 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps the middle way would be the *_governor*_ who volunteers to do the pruning please exercise your *_autonomy*_ by using your discretion 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:35:38 PM] Iwona Fluda: and some people might be not interested at all, some might be grateful, some pissed. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we don't exclude them at the first place.
[11/29/23, 4:36:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Im happy to do so, send me the list of the people not being involved including their emails or WhatsApp numbers, and I will make this happen.

[11/29/23, 4:43:43 PM] Iwona Fluda: One question: we are talking about the people in this channel, right? @14153000019 ?
[11/29/23, 4:45:06 PM] Gary Teh: The folks whom we have email addresses they would be listed on the *_contact information*_ tab of *_our ledger*_

Those that we don’t, we have some of their LinkedIn, Instagram or WhatsApp on the tab ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:47:03 PM] Gary Teh: In all 7 WhatsApp channels 

The reason why this clean up is because I know alot of folks use WhatsApp for communicating with their families and very close friends, so having undesired messages on their WhatsApp feels way more intrusive than on their LinkedIn, email, Instagram…

Hence the reason why I really want to minimize this intrusion into their private space ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:48:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: On this list, just a small group of people has their phone number or email address...
[11/29/23, 4:49:27 PM] Iwona Fluda: This is an assumption, we don't know if that's true. Unless you run a survey on this and asked them privately about their needs and preferences.
[11/29/23, 4:52:08 PM] Gary Teh: That would be very interesting 

I know a lot of them don’t even bother to respond to my private 1 on 1 message until months later (_on the average six months_)🤣

So I am not sure how to interpret what the lack of signal means 🤔

[11/29/23, 4:59:21 PM] Gary Teh: I think another creative way to solve the problem is that we should really become more discreet about who we let in to our channels

I am *_going to stop fund ongoing DAO expenses with my personal liquidity*_ starting beginning of this month. 

the USA government has a shutdown scenario that is often reported in the news
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_shutdowns_in_the_United_States

when our *_DAO runs out of liquidity*_, the following will happen 

    - TrueSight.me wix account shutdown 

    - Agroverse.shop Wix account shutdown 

    - Stamps.com account shutdown

    - Amazon.com seller account shutdown

[12/4/23, 12:34:49 PM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan for Agroverse sales related activities*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions to commercial buyer 

    - utilize existing 4 rules rubric based system without introducing additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the initial sale from buyer

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO, DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call for coordination_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator but not the role of sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a buyer. All prior listed rules (1-4) applies

[12/5/23, 4:44:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I think it's better to involve the first round of decision making with people who are actively working in the project and then it can come the DAO
[12/5/23, 7:08:35 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with @918017107841 hence why I have proposed a debate in the agroverse guild to flush out the best suitable incentives model for scaling a FMCG. This current proposal doesn’t reflect the complete value chain.
[12/5/23, 7:09:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I vote for n.3: current proposal not suitable for agroverse business model.
[12/5/23, 8:29:53 AM] Gary Teh: Since this does impact the distribution of governance tokens and hence voting rights within our DAO. 

The town hall is a more appropriate place for this debate to take place 

@120363044028036610@g.us is discussions for day to day operational matters only 

*_Analogy*_
    - @120363044028036610@g.us is the factory floor where workers build stuff

    - Townhall is where all the board of directors (general assembly) sit to discuss about policy matters impacting the entire DAO 

_PS: you don’t cook dinner in the toilet_
[12/5/23, 8:47:19 AM] Vlatko Gigov: No problem, we can discuss anywhere: 

What is the commission charged for processing payments on the agroverse shop? 

What is the commission charged by Amazon for selling products on their platform? 

Why should there be a discrimination against a human sales force if other mediums are adequately compensated? 

What is the incentive of the 46 other town hall members to actually act as a board of directors instead of just the empty floscule about board of directors exercising governance rights based on their tokens. 

How will you incentivise a decentralized sales force other than with $ sales commissions? If the sales rep wishes to relinquish the $ commission and obtain gov tokens that should be at their discretion.
[12/5/23, 8:47:54 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Otherwise this whole exercise becomes like the good ol’ communist order: we are all equal but some are more equal than the others. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 8:49:44 AM] Anupa/diya: The reason for proposing is that the internal team will be much for equipped to take decisions for matters that they work on rather in a whatsapp group where people will have to invest time reading, doing some sort of research if they lack information and then make decision. Which I clearly don't see happening
[12/5/23, 8:56:08 AM] Vlatko Gigov: FMCG scaling is much more different than selling software products. Also the relatives of our organisation do not allow for a salaried sales force. Even if the ales force was on a salary base there would still be % remuneration for successful sales. In the current case, the remuneration proposed only cators to a select few BOD members.
[12/5/23, 8:56:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: “We are all equal but some are more equal than the others”
[12/5/23, 9:01:04 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess the questions that we need to answer are:

1. How do we incentivise a decentralised sales force (Herbalife model maybe IDK)

2. How do we make sure everyone’s efforts are adequately and appropriately compensated? 

3. Your proposed model only allows for one thing to happen: a huge DUMP or even worse a rug pull from the largest token holders or the treasurer, if you remember our exciting trip in Dubai and the experts… 🤣
I hope your toilet analogy is not n.3 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:03:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @everyone these are very exciting times of this DAO, being there nearly from the beginning it’s a great experience. Many have told us that things will disintegrate much sooner. That we will never get this far because: there is not huge capital from a coin offering to incentivise contributions against or there isn’t a liquid token to exchange for.
[12/5/23, 9:04:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I’m open to other suggestions as long as we move slightly away from far left economic models. 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:07:28 AM] Vlatko Gigov: But liquidity will happen if we develop a sound economic model and incentives structures. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:49:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: By the way I am arguing here against my case since I hold second or third largest tdg purse, which is pointless if I don’t have an army of motivated and incentivised sales force to scale organic agroverse products… ie bringing dollarz to the treasury ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:50:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The other route would be let’s do an ICO and hope not to get flagged by the SEC if our bizz models fail and we deplete the treasury…
[12/5/23, 9:51:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I would always choose structured organic growth before a crowdfunding operation.
[12/5/23, 9:51:57 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Then once we have stable revenue models we can do a coin offering.
[12/5/23, 9:53:44 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess you are right @14153000019 to discuss these matters here: 1. Governance, 2. Treasury Management, 3. Sales force incentives
[12/5/23, 12:05:25 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to start incentivizing people with Fiat.  issuing tokens for me personally is fine.  but I think we can get a higher quality of sales people by giving them a monitary incentive to sell the product. And don’t get all flustered that most people are not here to be capitalists.  We are selling to capitalists, we should probably employ a few that understand the motivations.
[12/5/23, 12:07:17 PM] Val Lapidus: And as I’ve stated previously the monitory incentive to sell can be collected by any one, regardless of where they live, there is no barrier to entry to do this job, and there is nothing to prevent you from doing it.
[12/5/23, 12:28:23 PM] Gary Teh: We should test this hypothesis 

*Proposed test*

Recruit 10 test subjects to do sales 

5 subjects granted fiat only incentive 

5 subjects granted TDG only incentive 

All 10 subjects granted the same script to use to sell

Each subject required to generate their own sales leads 

Measure sales performance (average sales generated per subject) of these 2 groups over a 90 day period 

Group with the higher average sales revenue generated is *winning variant*

Roll out variant into production environment

_PS: someone else will need to run this experiment. I am exercising my *autonomy* not to do it as it is boring for me and I will be utilizing my time to do something else 🙂🙏_
[12/5/23, 12:44:21 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what needs to be proved out here. Gary.  And I'm going to practice my autonomy by not doing this and urge my fellow governor's not to do this as well. Human kind has been incentivized by money for hundreds of years. What? What am I proving?  So far our sales have been zero.  People have always had the autonomy to go and sell the product.  But have not utilized it.
[12/5/23, 12:45:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The logical option would be for sales agents to exercise autonomy: whether they want to receive $ or tokens or a mix of the two.
[12/5/23, 12:46:54 PM] Gary Teh: They don’t have the tools to sell

No tools no sales
[12/5/23, 12:47:36 PM] Vlatko Gigov: https://mapmycustomers.me/2021/10/13/average-sales-rep-compensation-by-industry/
[12/5/23, 12:47:44 PM] Val Lapidus: Has anyone actually volunteered and asked for the tools to sell?
[12/5/23, 12:48:21 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Well the simple deck / product information sheet hasn’t been prepared. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 12:50:57 PM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 asked for a presentation deck not a sales deck

[12/5/23, 12:51:39 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Yes the sales deck should just one page in the pres deck.
[12/5/23, 12:52:19 PM] Val Lapidus: If they are highly motivated, they can build whatever materials they want to sell the product
[12/5/23, 12:52:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The story existed, and it’s a good one. Now that we have the momentum we shouldn’t give up..
[12/5/23, 12:52:39 PM] Val Lapidus: They have a forum within agroverse to ask questions
[12/5/23, 12:53:10 PM] Val Lapidus: This is an autonomous out organization and should function as one.
[12/5/23, 12:53:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: When @918017107841 was in the agroverse guild things were running a tad bit smoother. Al thought that is not her scope.
[12/5/23, 12:55:24 PM] Val Lapidus: There is no one and nothing stopping the people wanting to sell from selling.  If they need materials to sell, they need to build the materials, not wait for me, or Gary, or any one else to be the bottleneck.  Autonomy is defined as: the right or condition of self-government.
[12/5/23, 12:58:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Makes sense to me. As I am illiterate in design work, I do exercise my autonomy to seek for help
[12/5/23, 12:58:35 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:09:30 PM] Gary Teh: Most of them don’t even know how the product actually looks and feel like 

It is very hard to pitch a physical product to a buyer without having one in your hand

The first thing I notice anyone does when they pick up the product is to put it to their nose and breathe in ecstasy 

Kind of hard to replicate that buying experience without the actual product in hand 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:10:15 PM] Val Lapidus: If they need the product, they should ask
[12/5/23, 1:10:40 PM] Val Lapidus: The only one who’se asked is Rodney and Vigi
[12/5/23, 1:10:56 PM] Gary Teh: And they did 

@41799155602 and @19209806391 

I know @18175503434 was asking about it when we chatted
[12/5/23, 3:12:52 PM] Vlatko Gigov: For me the deck / product spec is more important. Retailers know what nibs are they don’t know why our nibs differentiate from the non-organic competitors. Agroverse story is strong. Most of that info is in the website… ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 9:31:52 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's we take Autonomy has an example. Everyone has their own idea of what autonomy looks like  

In a project, if there are set actions given then those must be followed. if someone is doing something and someone else comes in and says it's my autonomy to change things. That's not on and it's a waste of time. 

Autonomy has to be defined for each project according to me because the variables differ from case to case.
[12/5/23, 9:35:05 PM] Anupa/diya: The people working within the project can decide what autonomy looks like for them and for larger issues it can be referenced to the DAO.
[12/5/23, 9:39:01 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That is why the contributions rubric was the closest thing to autonomy imo. I understand it’s a nightmare to keep track of the variables, but it only makes sense to appropriate quality metrics instead of quantity (# of hours)
[12/5/23, 9:43:42 PM] Anupa/diya: There can be sections - work remuneration past and present / work ethics/ deliverables/ code of conduct/ and so forth . This will also come under the governance. The main structure can be sub divided to small groups.
[12/5/23, 10:03:57 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 and @918017107841 

Please feel free to exercise your autonomy to work together to define and then propose a new rubric for voting into effect. 

I am open to exercising my autonomy to stand aside and refrain from further contribution to DAO until the new rubric has been proposed and voted on 🙂🙏

_PS: from my perspective this is part of DAO’s process of maturing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 10:11:41 PM] Anupa/diya: I don't think this should be the case. Let it run as it is for now till a group of active members can collectively draw up something defined

Two people from the DAO  might not reflect the voice of what the DAO wants. The governors table along with any other members can sort this out

There are a lot of things that need to be discussed.Rubric is one of them.
[12/5/23, 10:12:15 PM] Anupa/diya: Rubric has to taken in a lot of aspects and it has to be a collective decision so I wait for that group to be formed.
[12/6/23, 3:12:58 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe there should be a definition for the workflow and values for each specific project and people inside agree to that if not, they leave.

[12/6/23, 4:57:53 AM] Tomas - Offchain: the questions about engagement, ghosting, rules, behaviors, incentives, and payments are still in the air, Maybe ghosting here was an answer to a specific situation or a wrongly defined problem. Maybe it would be valuable to understand what happened to understand which rules work better. I would ask why did it happen to understand the root cause a little more. I agree that waiting for something that undermines our autonomy goes against the core principles.

[12/6/23, 8:05:04 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense, that is because your entire kharma within the ecosystem is recorded on the chain

Reddit for example does not allow members with exceptionally low kharma to contribute in certain things 

From my perspective, if a member’s kharma point is too low, I will be hesitant in allowing member to undertake task on critical path in projects even if member volunteers to do so

If you haven’t noticed already, new incoming members reaching out to me offering to help are often first assigned to task that are not on the critical path. 

The purpose of this is do an integrity verification

[12/6/23, 5:54:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel we need to update the governance model. A lot of it comes under for ethics and code of conduct. Deciding on actions over a poll on whatspp is slightly hasty 🤣 I feel there has to be a state and agreed document by the group where all or these are stayed and with outcomes decided for the most and then the voting should come into play.i don't think we can so lightly state strike outs. 

One might not even agree to the strike outs since it was not even stated by them so where is the autonomy in that. I don't think anyone is at the position to state a strike out even for themselves because it has to be community led and not dependent on one person and their decision.

One should be allowed to propose a strike out or any other rule, the town hall decide and then decide. 

When there is governors all categories should be voted or discussed for future voting

We should try and look at what the community wants. Everyone in the beer hall has so much to offer and the key question is how can they find value in the community and vice versa. 

Not everyone will be invested in the currents projects. So how do we mobilize the community. Cypher defense days  were great with so much activity

Could you elaborate on the following?

- what do you have in mind as differentiation? 
- ⁠The term differentiation is abstract, it could mean anything. 
- ⁠What is the competition in Switzerland that you are facing? 
- ⁠What is the gist story you are trying to tell? 
- ⁠What are the components in your story?
- ⁠what is the final CTA after you have delivered your story? ‎<This message was edited>
[12/12/23, 2:51:45 PM] Gary Teh: I would propose you start with an essay of the story you are planning to tell 

Each main point broken down into paragraphs 

Once your script is complete then how the deck gets constructed becomes self apparent
[12/12/23, 2:53:00 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 has stated he has no time to undertake sales 

His input on how sales should be conducted are non-statements

[12/12/23, 2:56:51 PM] Gary Teh: What do you define as Far Left? 

Does it mean when I pay for products I plan to buy at the local supermarket I go to the left most aisle as opposed to all the other cashiers in the super market to make my payment?

What are qualifiers and rules you propose for discussion? ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 3:04:27 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 1 and 2 are being managed just fine for the level of our dao. and for 3, I believe @16468233438 has surfaced a proposal worthy of discussion.
[12/12/23, 3:05:14 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 has disqualified himself yesterday on item 3

He is not a sales person

He is an ops person

The right people to discuss these are people actually going to undertake sales or have undertaken sales within the context of our DAO

Right now they are myself, you, @19209806391 and @12245781775 

I haven’t heard any complains from them regarding the new rules

Let’s just test the running sales using these new rules and then we regroup for discussion ‎<This message was edited>
[12/12/23, 3:07:38 PM] Val Lapidus: I can contribute to the discussion of compensation for sales without having to be a sales person for the dao
[12/12/23, 3:07:55 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. propose your rules and qualifiers

Do not surface none statements ‎<This message was edited>
[12/12/23, 3:12:27 PM] Vlatko Gigov: When have the rules been voted in? I believe there is a vote going on, or that’s done.
[12/12/23, 3:15:13 PM] Gary Teh: It’s already ended (7 days are past)

See the announcements
[12/12/23, 3:18:20 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I see. Then let’s push forward with the current voted in sales rep rules.
[12/12/23, 3:20:27 PM] Vlatko Gigov: All hail new Meta Rules! 😂 let’s now sell some nibs!
[12/12/23, 3:25:52 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.

[12/12/23, 3:29:18 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Communism
[12/12/23, 4:00:00 PM] Gary Teh: What does communism that mean?

Let’s just translate these into specific rules you are trying to describe 

There are so many variants out there that call themselves communism 

Lack of precise  definition for an abstract label will lead us to build sand castles on shaky grounds ‎<This message was edited>
