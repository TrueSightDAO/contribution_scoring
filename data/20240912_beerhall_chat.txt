[7/26/23, 3:25:05 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a step back and examining this setup, the dynamic closely replicates the prisoner’s dilemma
[7/26/23, 3:35:20 AM] Gary Teh: If no one buys any of the NFTs and the entire shipment is sold successfully then all the profits generated goes back to the DAO

If all the NFTs are sold off and the entire shipment is sold off, then (based on the Standard Rate) only 20% of the profit gets channeled back to the DAO. The NFT holders get 80% of the generated profit.
[7/26/23, 6:51:00 AM] Anupa/diya: We will have to look at Rte breakup of the nft and also what will be floor price in a bit more detail.
[7/26/23, 11:39:38 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective once our DAO buys back the NFTs after the entire shipment is clear, we burn it. 🙂
[7/26/23, 1:25:27 PM] Gary Teh: Do you have a formula that you would like to propose for consideration?
[7/26/23, 1:34:21 PM] Anupa/diya: I am doing a map which can be discussed openly. If we have people who are interested in the tokenomics, please reach out to us !
[7/26/23, 2:34:18 PM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to viewing the map 

I have personally set aside some funds which I will be happy to invest into the Shipment Financing NFTs of Agroverse if it’s structured in such a way it’s attractive for me as a fiat investor 

Not sure if you noticed… I have took off my operator/builder hat and looking at the deal purely from an investor perspective now that it’s starting to shape up for deal readiness. 🙂

Let’s find a good time and place for coffee??

[7/28/23, 1:28:10 AM] Gary Teh: Perfect! 🤩
[7/28/23, 1:52:18 AM] Gary Teh: Managed to bump into my friends Shirley and Wesi this morning during the event

Shirley is an angel investor in the Web3 space. Seems her hypothesis is aligned with ours regarding e-commerce being the first vertical that Web3 will really gain traction

Weisi use to work for Amazon and was for a while the Venture team for Aminoca brand (a really large Web3 fund focused on games)

Will offer Shirley access to mint the Agroverse shipment financing NFT when it becomes available

Will chat with WeiSi to get some insights on where the Aminoca brand is headed regarding investment themes to figure if there might be any alignment with our project when she invites over for the gathering of friends she mention she was going to organizing. (Jerry another DAO member is going to be there too) 🙂

[7/29/23, 4:04:58 PM] Gary Teh: Great session with @14152032783 and @8618926086648 where we chatted about the tokenomics for OffChain to mobilize community members in various cities around the world to organize IRL events and how TrueSight DAO could tap into that infrastructure (which we did a few times already) to source for new members to support the community ESG projects our DAO is pursuing in those parts of the world. 

There is a natural synergy there. The value of OffChain token and the TrueSight DAO token naturally reinforces and energizes each other’s value. 🤩

At some point when Agroverse and other projects start pulling in profits, we could vote to direct some of those to support House of Balance activities lead by @33652866472 and @13104674556 

Already TrueSight DAO have benefitted tremendously from that ecosystem with some really high powered members recruited from it

What I am starting to realize during my private pre-tasting is that there is actually a difference in taste between these varieties 🙂

We are trying to figure out how to best package these bags of cacao nibs we are bringing in from the small scale farmers we are working with in South America for the American market 🙂🙏
[8/2/23, 12:56:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Thanks Dan. I am also conducting session on experiences of keto. If we can get a few people or places to join that would be great !

[8/2/23, 10:53:11 PM] Gary Teh: This thread about sharing insights on cacao nibs for keto use on reddit is taking off like wildfire right now

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/15ge8eq/anyone_one_had_any_experience_using_cacao_nibs_in/

I still haven’t found a smooth transition to direct any of them to sign up for ouronline focus group via meetup.com

Ends up the snowballing conversation with all the keto Redditers are organically throwing off a whole bunch of insights into their keto consumption behavior

I think this problem you are observing is mainly the result of my profile. I have this tendency to just allow someone whom I am speaking to to just go where he/she naturally wants to go instead of directing them to go where I want them to go. Or even when we are hanging out we just end up going where the companion wants to go.

And yes, I will eventually head the way I want to go, but only after bidding them farewell with a smile and seeing them disappear around the bend. 

Compound this dynamic over a series of interactions with multiple people, instead of having a group of people congregating, we end up with a series of very deep one of one conversations between myself and a whole bunch of other people. Deep as in I totally understand what is going on in each and everyone of their head. Not sure if it actually goes the other way though because I default to the role of listener unless specifically prompted with a problem to think about and discuss. 🤔

[8/2/23, 11:15:07 PM] Gary Teh: Another interesting aspects of the Agroverse network to study and observe once it’s set up is the prisoner dilemma (cycle of destruction mechanism) that’s backed right into its core. 

Since prices of every single component of a shipment of cacao to the USA will be written into the blockchain for all to see, suppliers might initially “abuse” the network by baking too much margin into their quotation. however as we continue to scale by onboarding and making transparent more suppliers and their prices, the assumption is that suppliers will all end up keeping each other in check when they do provide their quotations or risk being cut out of the network for providing very uncompetitive pricing

Bulk of the members in our DAO are high level, high impact, highly connected individuals.

While it’s ok to manually test the viability of a process utilizing DAO members time, beyond the testing phase and entering into the execution phase, unless an activity in the process is generating at least USD100/hour of value (as according to our rubric) for the utilization of any DAO members time, the task should be reconsidered in the following order: 

    1 - dropped if possible 
    2 - automated using AI.
    3 - delegated to a non-DAO member (non believer)

@918017107841 is also based in India. She is right now designing a similar set of NFTs for Agroverse’s upcoming shipment of cacao nibs from South America to North America 

Perhaps the both of you should speak. I believe since both of you are in the same time zone collaboration should hopefully be easier 🙂👍

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chocolate-making-ingredient-cocoa-hits-highest-price-46-years-2023-06-28/

Price of cacao is expected to keep increasing over the next few years 

Based on what I observed when visiting Brazil and the Dominican Republic, we should expect supplies to continue rising for the foreseeable future 

And cacao does store very well for long periods of time if stored in the right conditions

One on one is the preferable method of communication. 

And the agenda needs to be set very clearly upfront.

[8/8/23, 9:00:31 PM] Gary Teh: I might be biased but it still default to our Brazilian cacao nibs
I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

[8/11/23, 2:44:46 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding our SunMint project Allison mentioned she will start looking into implementing solid state servers with zero moving parts. The challenge for her would be to keep the cost under USD1000

Those servers should theoretically run forever when deployed on the farmers’ premises 

Since we are considering the use of Proof of Authority for TrueChain, they should not cause too much heat generation

[8/11/23, 3:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: interesting how Jerry immediately homed in on the zero accountability characteristic that’s been baked right into the DNA of the DAO that Cindy (whom you introduced last year) pointed out when she was looking into our structure last year which from her perspective is disconcerting to traditional investors
[8/11/23, 3:35:59 AM] Gary Teh: After Jerry left for home, me and Allison stuck around for a short bit where we chat about our tendency to keep injecting entropy into the system whenever we observe it on the cusp of achieving some form of equilibrium. Basically a dissipative structure 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system
[8/11/23, 3:38:48 AM] Gary Teh: Jerry was joking about the human mechanical Turk where AI defines the strategy and humans perform the offline action 

Taking a step back and looking at where we are heading it does feel like our DAO is slowly headed in that general direction with the introduction of ChatGpt as the unofficial member which gets utilized a lot in the background

[8/13/23, 3:01:21 AM] Gary Teh: It is a recurring pattern I observe that whenever a person is attempting to profit from information arbitrage, he/she will exhibit very cagey behavioral patterns. 

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space. Based on what I have heard so far via the extended network, depending on where we attempt to bring this disruption to (especially in areas where cartels are in control), some of us might even encounter assassination attempts. Sounds exciting... 🤔

[8/13/23, 3:21:33 AM] Gary Teh: I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

[8/14/23, 6:04:58 PM] Gary Teh: What if we did the same nonsense but around the world and every time we find some really good ingredients that could be production used as a consumer product we just launch it on the Agroverse website
[8/15/23, 1:13:47 AM] Gary Teh: @14152693276 has been doing some RnD using chocolate as well this evening. 

Will pop by tomorrow to sample what was made. It looked really delicious in the photo 🙂

I am starting to sense as what I observed with @13104674556 @13134136108 and then myself, @16468233438 and @5511982667030 separately. 

The experience is not just about the consumption but also extends to the DIY RnD phase

It’s beyond food at this point, it’s crossing into the arts and craft section under the hobby category. My hunch is the creator enters into a FLOW state during this iterative process of creation. It’s almost therapeutic. 

I observe the creator profile also feels as sense of pride when the finally reveals the creation to the audience. 

And the shared consumption of the creation beyond that point almost feels like a celebration, a ritualized  consumption of sorts. 

I am starting to understand what @13134136108 meant when she mentioned the cacao ceremony can manifest in any form. 🙂
[8/15/23, 1:19:14 AM] Tess walkowski: That fits another movie and book, like water for chocolate
[8/15/23, 1:19:27 AM] Tess walkowski: Cooking has always been alchemy

[8/15/23, 1:22:49 AM] Tess walkowski: Do abuelas gaurd their mole recipes? Haha
[8/15/23, 1:23:25 AM] Tess walkowski: The groves that the Mayans had were for show like botanical gardens
[8/15/23, 1:24:07 AM] Tess walkowski: The reason the indigenous do pagamentos or payments to the earth or earth deity is to keep the balance

[8/15/23, 1:24:54 AM] Tess walkowski: There is still a mystery of who moved the cacao to Mexico.    Who traded this long long ago, a delicate plant and a hard journey.

[8/15/23, 2:41:31 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking further about the idea of videos and communal celebrations

Reminds me of this documentary I made last year when I was invited to attend my friend’s master class in Fremont here in the Bay Area

He regularly goes around the Pacific Northwest teaching people how to forage and prepare food using foraged ingredients 

I wonder how receptive folks would be attending a monthly meetup in their local neighborhood where one of their own guides them in the form of a workshop on how to turn cacao nibs into chocolate bars 

https://youtu.be/rmulfscDVNU
[8/15/23, 2:53:16 AM] Gary Teh: Further extending on this what if we went about visiting, sampling and performing FSVP on those small scale farmers yet exporting to the USA across the entire Amazon region and then started bringing in their cacao nibs online into our Agroverse direct distribution network 

It definitely sounds like a very “nomadic” thing to do 🤣
[8/15/23, 2:56:01 AM] Tess walkowski: We do camps and schools and workshops.
[8/15/23, 2:56:37 AM] Tess walkowski: Composting. Fermenting. Foraging.
[8/15/23, 2:59:49 AM] Tess walkowski: We had a long discussion last night about the black Panthers
[8/15/23, 3:00:26 AM] Tess walkowski: One think people don't think about is that they provided food.
[8/15/23, 3:01:24 AM] Tess walkowski: Living in a dense area now in the north it's not like Cali or Florida where the food is cheap and nice
[8/15/23, 3:02:47 AM] Tess walkowski: One of the critiques is that finished chocolate is not made in the countries where the beans are. I'm not making chocolate.
[8/15/23, 3:03:14 AM] Tess walkowski: I found out about seeds in the traditional blend, cieba seeds
[8/15/23, 3:03:35 AM] Tess walkowski: So maybe a forget knows what cieba seeds to eat and how to add them to cacao
[8/15/23, 3:04:16 AM] Tess walkowski: The original recipe should be frothy..... Mixed in with 🌽
[8/15/23, 3:04:26 AM] Tess walkowski: It's like poridge
[8/15/23, 3:04:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Mix some nibs with the acorn pancake
[8/15/23, 3:06:00 AM] Tess walkowski: Farmers farm. Traders move products. Cookers cook.

I am prompting for him to check if he could get the contacts of the agricultural cooperative that the broker is interfacing with

After understanding how the regulations work here We can’t take imports from foreign food suppliers until we have inspected their facilities and gave them a thumbs up

[8/15/23, 10:47:30 PM] Tess walkowski: On asking my friends their certification would cost about $3000 - $5000
[8/15/23, 10:49:08 PM] Tess walkowski: I dream of the idea of a fund which supports bio diversity and farming regenerative land
[8/15/23, 10:49:47 PM] Tess walkowski: My friend Miguel does it here in Michigan.   He has cows and trees the two go together and now he has a maple forest.
[8/15/23, 10:50:15 PM] Tess walkowski: He doesn't sell his products and never will.  Trade and gift only. Because of the law.
[8/15/23, 10:51:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Like a dao model in a way. Milk a cow get some cheese. Help cook maple get syrup.
[8/16/23, 12:16:54 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. uSd3000-5000 to get certified for USDA NOP organic
[8/16/23, 12:17:50 AM] Gary Teh: That is the model I have proposed for Hans martin to adopt in Switzerland
[8/16/23, 12:23:30 AM] Tess walkowski: I think that's their export licence with the government, it would work properly only if a few farmers got together
[8/16/23, 12:25:04 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[8/16/23, 12:26:00 AM] Gary Teh: Have them organize as a cooperative and then we can deal with them

Not cost effective for us to deal with one farmer at a time 

Or what might be even more interesting would be for us to form the cooperative in Ecuador and recruit them to it
[8/16/23, 12:27:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Or in some time when I raise money for cacao acres :)
[8/16/23, 12:27:24 AM] Tess walkowski: Maybe there are different laws to trade with ecudor.
[8/16/23, 12:27:44 AM] Tess walkowski: They are asking other friends if anyone has the licenses
[8/16/23, 12:28:40 AM] Tess walkowski: For example in Ghana no one is allowed to direct purchase beans..... They did an experiment with fair trade which pain more and made a lot of money
[8/16/23, 12:29:05 AM] Tess walkowski: But it didn't really change who farmers sold to despite fair trade paying more
[8/16/23, 12:30:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Each big chocolate company makes a unique flavor profile and has to make sure they can recreate it
[8/16/23, 12:32:45 AM] Gary Teh: So farmers made more money. Consumers spent the same. Manufacturers and retailers made less
[8/16/23, 1:22:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade costs more
[8/16/23, 1:22:49 AM] Tess walkowski: Farmers sold to whoever came first
[8/16/23, 1:25:15 AM] Tess walkowski: And that's Ghana. I pay way more for actual farm produce here.
[8/16/23, 1:27:21 AM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade chocolate is usually like fifty cents more.
[8/16/23, 1:29:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Most farming we eat it plantations the cacao etc.    All our grocery fruit our organic berries etc.
[8/16/23, 1:31:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Small farmers in USA succeed by becoming the producers.    That's where there is more money. But this requires consumers to change.  Which they do.    Even if everyone shops in the grocery store, they still consume treats or habits based on ethics or diet or morals etc etc.
[8/16/23, 1:32:25 AM] Tess walkowski: In the old days before whole foods there were co ops
[8/16/23, 1:32:46 AM] Tess walkowski: People had to join to purchase bulk super foods
[8/16/23, 1:47:50 AM] Gary Teh: So fair trade means farmers get paid more, manufacturers and retailers get paid the same and consumers end up paying more???
[8/16/23, 2:05:19 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 do you think that is fair?
[8/16/23, 10:47:54 AM] Tess walkowski: I would assume on a higher price point retailets make more
[8/16/23, 10:48:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes I think it's fair.
[8/16/23, 10:48:55 AM] Tess walkowski: What I don't think is fair is monopolies price gouging
[8/16/23, 10:50:39 AM] Tess walkowski: We are dealing with monoculture and multinational companies, though I think the food in Cali and Florida is more diverse.
[8/16/23, 10:52:46 AM] Tess walkowski: I think most artisanal coffee is fair trade.
[8/16/23, 10:53:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I pay significantly more for food from an actual farmer and gladly.    That's different than fair trade that's local.
[8/16/23, 10:55:05 AM] Tess walkowski: If there was fair trade oranges , oranges that didn't destroy Chile, I would be the evangelist of that company.

[8/18/23, 2:59:17 PM] Iwona Fluda: And here we need to remember that we had 8 people registered! Maybe the timing is wrong or maybe, we could ask them to pay 1 dollar, so they will show up.
[8/18/23, 3:51:30 PM] Gary Teh: No response. It was basically a reminder email

I am aware both of you have questions about blockchain and web3 related stuff 

I have been receiving your DMs

I observed a lot of the questions I have been getting lately are somewhat recurring

Maybe we should just set a time to organize a AMA on LinkedIn 

Where anyone can participate by either asking whatever Web3 related questions you might have or simply chime by suggesting solutions you might employed successfully under such circumstances 

I believe it’s more effective use of time 

Please feel free to schedule the session and I will pop by 

As @918017107841 personally experienced recently, it took me more than a week to respond to her questions she sent via DM. 

@5491125130580 I know you have a whole bunch of questions for me so I believe it will not just personally benefit you but everyone else as well to have these questions answered

[8/23/23, 2:01:00 AM] Gary Teh: Love the idea you brought to @16468233438 about donating part of the profit proceeds to carbon offsets 

What I actually found even more intriguing was when meshing up  your idea with the one that @554888644380 surfaced earlier in the year 

Why stop there?

Cabruca cacao farmers plant trees i the jungle anyways 

We do know that carbon credits are issued when trees are planted 

Instead of donating the proceeds for carbon offsets, why not donate the proceeds to help these farmers plant even more cacao trees and in the process get carbon credits issued 

We can sell off these carbon credits to companies that need these carbon credits for their day to day operations

Seems like he is hinting at the following types of hard currency

Cacao backed coins
Gold backed coins
Land backed coins 
Energy backed coins
Military backed coins

Anything that is tied directly to physical resources that have direct utilization purpose and not fiat which issuers could simply mint away their debts while devaluing the store of value that savers hope to utilize in the future

Figured to share some short clips here. 

I believe at some point, we should have enough to make a mini-documentary

Will go collect more clips during this upcoming visit to the Bahia region

[8/27/23, 1:58:23 PM] Gary Teh: I was giving some further thoughts about this

*The conclusion about what Agroverse is*
Agroverse is not the low cost provider of cacao nibs for people who simply want to drink cacao and will further perpetuate the social hardship and environmental destruction purely for the purpose of profitability 

Agroverse is a simple no brainer daily experience that anyone can engage in if they see themselves as deeply spiritual person with profound love for our humanity and natural environment. 

Someone who because of this profound love wants to do their part to save our Amazon forest and reverse climate change. 

It just so happens that we are engaged in drinking carefully sourced cacao as part of our efforts
[8/27/23, 2:02:52 PM] Gary Teh: So from this perspective a consumer that is just purely looking at price and has no love for our fellow humanity and our natural environment is not our target customer
[8/27/23, 2:05:32 PM] Tess walkowski: Even on this website there is a major difference between those prices one is $4 one is $8
[8/27/23, 2:06:13 PM] Tess walkowski: This site is b2b and requires minimum purchase
[8/27/23, 2:46:33 PM] Gary Teh: What is the minimum purchase??
[8/27/23, 2:47:05 PM] Tess walkowski: Starts at $100
[8/27/23, 2:47:25 PM] Tess walkowski: They have criolla I would try
[8/27/23, 2:47:45 PM] Tess walkowski: Not much
[8/27/23, 2:48:37 PM] Tess walkowski: Personally I would choose to pay more when it's ethical.
[8/27/23, 2:48:50 PM] Tess walkowski: I would want to find the best not the cheapest
[8/27/23, 2:50:06 PM] Tess walkowski: We probably need to have it here in USA at under $10 a kilo cleared I think ?
[8/27/23, 2:50:59 PM] Tess walkowski: I pay a lot for my criolla.
[8/27/23, 2:51:39 PM] Tess walkowski: It's not "ceremonial" if I don't have the right stuff
[8/27/23, 2:55:20 PM] Tess walkowski: B2B ethical criolla ceremonially fair trade, sure it's fine to even pay the initial trade more up to $22 a kilo   shipping customs will add another $8-15

[8/29/23, 12:30:33 AM] Anupa/diya: Carbonbase is very proud to announce partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to Launch Asia's First Digital Carbon Registry.
Carbonbase, a climate-tech and carbon reduction solutions provider, is excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to launch Global Climate Registry (GCR), Asia’s first digital native Carbon Registry.

"Our previous work in supporting climate solutions' adoption in APAC naturally drove us to find new ways to inspire and aid climate action" Max Song CEO of Carbonbase noted.

"We believe in a future where the balance sheet of our planet lives on a public ledger. It is critical that standards and methodologies are governed and operated in a publicly auditable manner that is easy for project developers to adopt." said Wes Geisenberger, Vice President of Sustainability & ESG at The HBAR Foundation.

"GCR represents a pivotal milestone in the intersection of climate change, digital green finance and blockchain technology" said Katherine Foster, Executive Director Green Digital Finance Alliance & Former Canadian Climate Diplomat.

Blockchain can significantly improve the current bottlenecks of current carbon registries and increase transparency, accountability and traceability of greenhouse gas emissions. It helps companies provide more accurate, reliable, standardised, and readily available data on carbon emissions.

This decentralized approach allows for tracking and reporting of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions along the entire supply chain, including manufactures, suppliers, distributors and consumers.

[8/29/23, 2:22:32 AM] Gary Teh: Had the great opportunity to listen to Mike Jordan share his theory on statistical contract theory during the talk this Sunday in Berkeley University. 

https://www.amazon.science/blog/icassp-michael-i-jordans-alternative-view-on-ai

The framework reminds me of how the number of tokens for each category of contribution is set in our rubric. 

How his theory applies to us is that overtime as we collect more data for each category of contribution on our ledger we will be able to determine via statistics what the right amount of governance token should be. 

Have a read of his paper if you are keen.
[8/29/23, 2:42:28 AM] Gary Teh: If we ever get to the point one day of training an AI to automatically grade an incoming contribution based on our rubric and then automatically adjust the value of governance tokens associated with a line item of our rubric then we would have basically implemented the theoretical framework he posits in practice

[9/1/23, 12:17:23 AM] Gary Teh: Everyday in the morning after you have finished brushing your teeth, the app will propose three verbs that you are already going to do anyway sometime during the day 

You will choose one out of the three proposed 

During the course of the day when you perform the verb, you will be required to be fully present when performing it for just 3 seconds  

Nothing else beyond that 

The choice of verb proposed for you will be surfaced based on your astrological natal chart that will most heighten your energy frequency for the day. It’s based on 五行 the five elements and the astrological research from the banaras spiritual institute of India

[9/1/23, 12:27:04 PM] Val Lapidus: don't keep your nibs in glass jar, exposure to light will is not good for them

Some of the historical *key reasons for common pool resources management failure*:

1. to define clearly what are the resources being managed

2. Clear accounting of how much resource is there

3. Not making the pain of management failure clear and in your face vivid.

He mentioned the same thing as @14806488258 

Creating our own insurance facility at some point that folks along the supply chain can purchase to insure shipment passing through our network

Coincidentally insurance is the business for parent company to social impact fund that  @14152693276 is at. 

@41799155602 also mentioned the floating of a futures sustainable commodity market. This seems to in line with the thinking of the cooperative folks in Bahia

[9/7/23, 10:44:12 AM] Gary Teh: I finally bumped into a local that spoke English last night at one of the cafes. 

She explained the same hobo whom I bumped into again the second evening and showed me his knife… again… was in fact trying to rob me… both times in fact. 

He walked off the second time cursing and swearing. In hindsight it must have been a really frustrating experience for him for attempt at robbing someone and fail miserably because of communication breakdown 🤔

I would have imagined if I was a robber, I would have just took the knife and stabbed my target instead of showing it to him both two times as though I was trying to sell him the knife 🤷‍♂️

[9/13/23, 1:40:18 AM] Anupa/diya: It will be a byproduct to the larger purpose. The alignment and purpose of a DAO will be important for the sustainability
[9/13/23, 8:36:51 AM] Suheil - Europe: it's not about blockchain, it is about building a proper "automated" ecosystem. by theory we know that as a tool blockchain is the most efficient to adopt efficient scalability. 

until now, everything has been worked on by small teams on heavily dependent on a couple of individuals ( just like in a traditional company). Which is completely normal for bootstrap and MVP If we are progressively targeting real decentralization .... other wise it would be just another project ran by some specific teams with a very obvious kill switch threat 🤷‍♂️ 

conclusion: blockchain is a TOOL that CAN help us build progressively into a DAO.
[9/13/23, 9:22:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: while we are talking about this i read : "“We have global clients looking to use these products and in some sense, almost not caring that it’s blockchain, right? They just want access to this new feature.”" from big boss at JP Morgan

[9/16/23, 12:21:42 PM] Gary Teh: two potential ESG community initiatives has organically has surfaced during this trip

*initiatives discovered*
     - vacuum sealer for cooperative here to be used on the cacao nibs to be shipped: USD2000

    - somewhat falling apart facility that youths here hangout at that city hall set aside: budget TO be determined

*followups*
    - surface voting to DAO to extend page on Agroverse.shop focused on ESG initiatives we seek to fund with profits
[9/16/23, 12:49:30 PM] Gary Teh: There has been some discussions surfaced organically by them about setting a local NGO here that utilize our governance model but on blockchain to ensure funds are channeled where they should. 

It’s been proposed that someone from our DAO be invited to join as director to ensure the integrity of the governance model

[9/16/23, 1:11:20 PM] Anupa/diya: That would be necessary if the DAO governance feeds in to the community.

 It would also be necessary that the DAO appoints the flag bearers from the farming community who will liason this community
[9/16/23, 2:10:19 PM] Gary Teh: True. Someone else should volunteer for this

I have too much on my plate… I just want to do… nothing!! 🤩

What I heard from Orlantildes is that a lot of the land were simply abandoned by the farmers when the witch bloom fungus invaded their cacao plantation

[9/22/23, 6:29:29 AM] Gary Teh: Understood from the cooperative they right now are exploring issuing cacao coins to their farmers in exchange for taking their cacao inventory 

Once Agroverse prove we can sell off their inventory in the USA market, I think we might be able to propose to the cooperative to a deeper partnership. to send us their inventory on consignment (we don’t pay for it)

The way I envision it working is that in this scenario:

    - the farmers themselves become the financiers of the inventory 

    - our DAO finances the freighting cost to USA which we will then deduct from the *gross profit* 

    - our DAO finances the packaging cost which we will then recoup from the *gross profit* 

    - from the *net profit* , DAO charge the standard rate (19%) to back the value of our governance tokens 

     - of the *net profit* the rest (81%) all goes back to the farmers for financing the inventory. They get a really good price 
    
    - we retool Edgar (our AI) to monitor USA online markets to identify *consumer market arbitrage opportunities* for the farmers products 

    - farmers and DAO can utilize Edgar’s report to decide which USA consumer market opportunity to bet on. This will be possible because we have full visibility of all the cost components along the entire supply chain 

    - farmer bears cost for inventory. DAO bears cost for freighting. Both have enough skin in the game to want the outcome to be positive 

    - the cooperative self regulates the cost price of the inventory. If they price it too high, the USA consumer will not buy. DAO will not want to take shipment 

    - cooperative members contributing to help build out the network can vote on standard rate too. 

All interest are aligned, we end up with a self balancing system. No need to haggle over price between supplier and distributor 🤩

[9/23/23, 10:44:22 PM] Gary Teh: Beginning to get a sense of what business development after being first introduced to this subject two years ago by @6598383264 and then observing @41799155602 in action up close on how it’s conducted 

If our projects are software, it’s Basically an iterative hacking process which involves modifying its API interface to integrate with external third party service provider or fitting into external third service consumer while keeping a residue of the resource that flows through the pipeline 🤩
[9/23/23, 10:56:17 PM] Gary Teh: The primary difference between software development and business development I observe is that 

During the hacking process, when software receives “junk” inputs, they will either throw well formed exception messages or simply crash 

With business development, since we are technically “hacking” humans, subjects either get really annoyed, frustrated or just simply stop responding when fed with “junk” inputs 

“White box” based testing methods to figure out what works and what not tends to be more challenging to deploy as a hacking approach in business development 🤔

‎[9/26/23, 8:48:55 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/26/23, 8:53:35 AM] Dr. Denis: Plants need CO2 and warm weather to grow. Current average global temperature is 13.9 degrees C while minimum ambient temp required for human survival is 18 degrees. Man-made global warming is scam! We are lucky to live during the current warming period explained by maltitude of natural factors

[9/26/23, 9:29:28 AM] Dr. Denis: Build a coal power plant to supply affordable and reliable electricity and heat to people that would be also highly beneficial to nature ecosystem
[9/26/23, 9:31:20 AM] Gary Teh: Do you have any studies at all on the yearly carbon emissions of a regular coal power plant? 

And what are some latest RnD that will allow for a coal power plant to emits zero carbon?
[9/26/23, 9:32:49 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a study on how much carbon is consumed by plants for photosynthesis per year and how much carbon is already being generated by all living organisms will be really helpful

What we want to net balance

[9/26/23, 10:02:25 AM] Dr. Denis: I am pretty serious about climate change, fake "green energy" and "CO2 damaging the environment" fraud propagated by mass-media, UN bodies and politicians. It has nothing to do with real science. I've been doing my own research in this area for 20+ years (up to PhD level) and I am happy that the laureate of Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 Dr. John Clauser confirmed that I was right https://youtu.be/TGrMvlxEQGk
[9/26/23, 10:07:46 AM] Dr. Denis: There is a tight "Energy-Water-Food" nexus. It's not possible to solve one problem while ignoring & exacerbating other problems. Dutch farmers pump CO2 into greenhouses to increase their yields. CO2 is the food for plants and the source of life on Planet Earth. Capturing CO2 from coal power plants and/or buying fake voluntary carbon offset is non-sense. As a supporter of Agroverse DAO I am sharing here my thoughts and I am eager to contribute my academic & practical knowledge
[9/26/23, 10:14:11 AM] Gary Teh: So can we do the reverse?

When farmers pump CO2 into their farm we issue carbon credits??

@14152032783 and @8618926086648 has helped setup the San Francisco off chain telegram channel where lots of web3.0 events are advertised

I wonder if it would be helpful to reach out to all of them to offer complementary cacao nibs tasting as and when we need feedback for our cacao nibs 

The channel is here

[9/30/23, 10:59:39 PM] Jonathan: This sounds like a nice value add or maybe at an event with a little time for you to talk about the DAO behind it. The key would be able to make it easy to order if people enjoyed them. Really easy to order.
[9/30/23, 11:14:43 PM] Gary Teh: Venmo where we can accept payment right now for the inventory we have on display

If we run out then QR code where they could just order on our website  

Natural complement to the events organized by OffChain since I observe most of the events cater food as well 

We can be one of the mini-caterers
[9/30/23, 11:16:36 PM] Jonathan: Sounds like it has some legs.. especially if you can get the story out which will probably give web3 people a bit more incentive to buy
[10/1/23, 3:17:55 AM] Gary Teh: I think the important thing is recurring buying behavior like a subscription model

What might be interesting would be to serve one cacao derivative (brownie, ceremonial cacao drink…) during a meetup and then have the recipe (perhaps even the profile of the creator) handy and the cacao nibs ready for sale if participants want to DIY when they get home

Each month we will feature the most popular community submitted recipe during the meetup

Perhaps if web3 project wants to get their project feature, their team should compete by submitting their own recipes as well.


*Two potential methods for distributing our governance tokens too*

    - creator of winning recipe for the month 

    - off chain member who held the meetup and got critical mass of participants

*purpose*
    - serves to incentivize web3 project participation in friendly competition of who makes the best cacao recipe for the month 

    - serves to incentivize off chain member who holds the meetup to do a good job of drawing crowd 

    - to them the token will have value as it’s value is backed by the profit generated from the sale of cacao nibs they are tasting ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/23, 1:47:00 PM] Gary Teh: Before I left Bahia, the cooperatives gave me some samples of highly differentiated cacao derivatives that were never before seen in the USA market 

They will probably need some investment before they could be brought online and made available in the USA market 

Since the samples are small, I am thinking of conducting a sample tasting and RnD prioritization session in SF when I get back. 

To ensure optimal experience, there shall only be 8 slots in this session. And they will be reserved only for DAO members who are qualified as general assembly members 🙂🙏

https://docs.google.com/document/d/190Bs1VI_NY3gxZ-j7dN2N61_CDDBIfQiht9f13sGxS4/edit

Items 1 and 2 we can repackage for immediate sale on our website Agroverse.shop

Items 1-3 we will run a focus group to get some feedback with the help of @14152032783and @8618926086648 from OffChain as well as the Folks from Edge and Node

Items listed for *internal sampling*, we will invite DAO members (who are qualified as general assembly members) based in SF to come and help provide feedback and prioritize for productization 

As suggested by @5511982667030 I am chatting with @41765737357 to figure how *items 6 and 7* might be packaged as corporate gifts or gifts for special social occasions if DAO finally decides to go down the route proposed by @5511982667030

This video by Steve Jobs reminds me of how our guild model operates. 

Since there is a maximum capacity of 8 players per guild, the player least able to self actualize gets invited out to free up the opportunity for another player who can more readily self actualize within the scope of the guild 

Getting the opportunity to contribute in a TrueSight DAO guild is equivalent to the opportunity to self actualization in a collaborative space of like minded individuals ‎<This message was edited>

[10/3/23, 6:00:22 PM] Gary Teh: Spent the past 3 hours working on some semblance of a roadmap for TrueSight DAO. Items on the roadmap are subjected to changed depending on how the general environment unfolds. 

*The following Items are addressed*:
    - Future expansion of Agroverse in the USA market beyond successful sales of 100KG cacao nibs
    - When we will finally do initial round of "fundraising" for TrueSight DA
    - Future expansion of Agroverse beyond the USA market
    - When the SunMint project will finally come online
    - How TrueSight DAO might transition into a network state

[10/4/23, 1:55:01 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes will look at it and had some points.
[10/4/23, 2:15:36 PM] Anupa/diya: I was in conversation with an investor for an project. They asked me whay my exit strategy would be. This would be see how much they would like to invest and in what intention we are building 

 It made ne reflect about Trusight. Is it a forever plan. Do we scale and sell. I think it might be a good idea to make a collective strategy group and have people meet once a month
[10/4/23, 2:31:20 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm surprised no one is asking you what you would use the money to do?
[10/4/23, 2:31:31 PM] Val Lapidus: What are we fundraising for?

[10/4/23, 3:13:45 PM] Gary Teh: Feel free to do that in @⁨[ops] The Town Hall⁩ 

In the roadmap I did indicate that at some point we might start listing our governance tokens on decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges 

But those are when our operations and cash flows have fully scaled up to make the listing cost negligible (like a drop in the ocean) compared to the volume of profit we are generating. 

I think at that point which our DAO starts generating massive volume of cash flow, governance token holders should really think long and hard if they want the tokens listed and start introducing speculative elements within our DAO (like Tesla on the stock market) or just keep the governance tokens privately held only amongst contributors (like Craigslist)

Elon Musk did ever mentioned he regret bringing Tesla public because of all the public attention and all the speculative psychology introduced that distracts all Tesla employees once during an interview 

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-has-deep-regrets

I haven’t heard any of those 20 employees working at Craigslist complaining at all. They are literally pulling millions of dollars every year just between the 20 of them. I am sure they probably have a great time throwing their own version of the Carnival of Truth every quarter in some nice locations around the world and have no investors to report to 🤣

[10/4/23, 11:04:21 PM] Gary Teh: when you examine TrueSight DAO and it’s projects critically, it is basically fundraising everyday. Though alot of times fiat did not change hands 

Me investing my time and energy in it. @16468233438 doing the same. @918017107841 doing the same. @41799155602 doing the same. Shadi helping build the main site. @5511982667030 taking precious time away from her busy schedule to help when she could be selling it for a lot more via her consulting….

Folks who helped reposting all the Linkedin posts… 

All these micro-actions contributed by DAO members in exchange for governance tokens is fund raising. It’s just that no Fiat change hands. So unless you truly understand what investment is you wouldn’t recognize it when it’s happening right under your nose

So unless there is an expense item that needs a huge amount of fiat, I really don’t see any reason why we would need to go out of our way to convince some fund managers to write a big cheque. If we ever get to the point where we are forced to do that this means there is something wrong in the way we are operating or probably tackling a problem set that is not well suited for a decentralized model. 🤔

@16468233438’s sister in law who helps tech companies fundraise was examining our operating model last year. Her first feedback was in a DAO no one is truly accountable. And VCs hate that. There is zero sense of control and there is no way to fire the “CEO” and replace him/her with a better one when performance is not good. That is because there is none. 

That was the same exact feedback when I was chatting about this model with Jerry whose wife runs a VC fund. Zero accountability. People just come in and do whatever they feel like or take a break as and when they want to. 

@14806488258 summed it up the best. There are categories of problem that will generate 100X returns and require hyper growth and a strong central command and control. Those set of problems are best tackled by the existing startups and VC model

There are a separate set of problems that do yield returns but not the 100X kind which are still socially/environmentally important to tackle and solve. Those are where DAOs play a critical role. 

The community comes together to crowd fund the solving of a problem. The output is an economically self sustaining infrastructure that benefits both the society and the environment. You would probably get some healthy return multiples from you micro-investments if things pan out but don’t expect to retire on it ‎<This message was edited>
[10/5/23, 2:27:59 AM] Gary Teh: Also speaking of fundraising to finance big ticket items, I been having this side discussion with Satheesh this past day.

Seems his feelings got hurt by me repeating the same exact warning about the macro environment here which I gave him when I realized he was attempting to fundraise last month.

Right now is the worst of the worst macro environment to hope for someone to write a big fat cheque to fund your ideas. 

*signals I am getting*

1. Federal reserve Interest rates are still hiking like crazy

2. VCs are dramatically writing down the valuations of their portfolio companies

3. More rounds of layoffs are still happening in startups 

4. LPs are skittish about funding VCs. Even VCs themselves are laying off their entry to mid level associates

Jason Calanis already issued an early warning to all startups late last year that they should have at least raised enough to last for two years because the quarter starting October 2023 is going to be the worst of the worst

 If they haven’t secured their funding by then, they should at least make sure they internally have enough to last till mid 2024 with no further external fund injection. There are so many of these startups declaring bankruptcy right now and just simply shutting down 

Everytime I go visit some  of my friends startups here these past few months, I hear through the grapevine another round of lay offs  

I was joking with @16468233438 just now when we were hanging out over at his place, I have technically structured my entire lifestyle to be as independent of fiat as possible. With the current configuration, there is no expenses spent on accommodation. Bulk of it is just spent on food and transport. 

@16468233438 was suggesting to further refine this configuration by sourcing for food when in urban settings from the food banks which run daily. Then the only thing that still relies on fiat is basically transport and software subscription cost I am incurring on behalf of the DAO. 🤔

I am actually tempted to experiment with that food bank idea of his 

Right now, after manually survey all six continents over the past five years, I am doing the exact reverse. The experiment I am conducting right now is optimizing my physical movement to have all my needs fully met without needing to step out of the 4 square blocks here in SF. 🤩

Next month, I will up the ante of this experiment by spent three weeks at the zen monastery on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge 🤣

There is no better way to reset the hedonic thread mill by hitting a hard reset button going in the opposite direction. 🤩

This deliberate self restriction of physical movement seems also aligned with what @6590995199 suggested for this period when he looked at my date and time of birth using his own fortune telling system 🤔

Side note, fiat is a proxy of the actual resource required to get stuff done. If you could by pass fiat to get the stuff done, then there is no need fiat. So if such is the case, why waste precious time and resources chasing after fiat? 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/5/23, 2:39:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: truesight dao can’t and does not need traditional fundraising methods. specifically not vc’s. . by fundraising we take cheap money and spend expensive expertise. the dao’s strength is innovating the way traditional businesses seek resources from expertise /human power to funds/budgets for scalability… the moment agroverse rolls and starts generating revenue, the dao can seek funds via “community investing/funding /grants“. 
investments /funding will be on micro and specific related subjects. 
In the moment we have operations hence we create value to truesight token and when ready/mature enough we can launch it on defi’s to generate liquidty...
[10/5/23, 2:42:19 AM] Suheil - Europe: or you can do like all the majority building new web3 businesses defying the total principles of it so you can fundraise easy via truesight inc and re centralize the decentralize system hhh ‎<This message was edited>

[10/5/23, 3:45:52 AM] Anupa/diya: That's a given . For sure. If we need to digitize the ledger and if we need to scale. We will end it

[10/5/23, 4:10:53 AM] Gary Teh: In terms of digitizing the ledger, I still haven't seen anyone bother to step and be the book keeper or bother to update the ledger for their own contributions. 

If no one is already voluntarily doing that on Google sheet I wonder who will actually bother to do it on blockchain if and when we migrate over... 

All the psychological studies states more effort equals lower conversion rate... I figure until something drastically changes, it will primarily be just wishful thinking🤔🤣
[10/5/23, 4:49:45 AM] Anupa/diya: I personally feel it's an effort  to a. Locate the link. B. Figure out the calculation and then go to another site to see how it reflects
[10/5/23, 4:50:59 AM] Anupa/diya: The ux has to be seamless like a shopping select and buy sale
[10/5/23, 4:51:27 AM] Anupa/diya: We need something which is like direct banking experience
[10/5/23, 4:53:43 AM] Anupa/diya: Quick and immersive
[10/5/23, 4:53:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: when the base mother website will be ready , then we can implement this
[10/5/23, 4:55:36 AM] Anupa/diya: The current website is just a top layer to the original trusight Dao done by Gary Both need to be sanwhixhed together

[10/9/23, 1:21:26 PM] Suheil - Europe: ah i got the response ii think i iforgot to update here, their response was to re apply when we advance further with the project .
My personal opinion is they want to see how we create value to our tokenomics
[10/9/23, 1:22:00 PM] Gary Teh: Have you showed them our Agroverse.shop??
[10/9/23, 1:23:00 PM] Suheil - Europe: everything.
both whitepapers. 
agroverse pages (back then was the old version of the website)
[10/9/23, 1:23:10 PM] Gary Teh: Or this listing on Amazon 

https://www.amazon.com/Product-title-Agroverse-Organic-Brazil/dp/B00NNYBMJ8
[10/9/23, 1:24:15 PM] Suheil - Europe: this listing just got on , no ? i got theiir reply a while ago already . we can always re apply not an issue i wantted to wait unttil we generatte firrst sales or traffic . one mooment i check eexact date of their feedback
[10/9/23, 1:25:12 PM] Gary Teh: Got on Amazon mid last week 

Still need to follow up with them on the incorrect category problem
[10/9/23, 1:25:47 PM] Suheil - Europe: i got theiir response 3 weeks ago
[10/9/23, 1:29:28 PM] Suheil - Europe: also dont confuse nikita is joining their incubator program , iits completely different to the “fundraise applicatiion”: i submitted. 

thinking about it, joining an accelerator/ incubator makes much more sense for our project that asking for fundraise/ grant
[10/9/23, 1:31:12 PM] Anupa/diya: I have seen quite a few. J p Morgan had a great one. If there are a few people interested.  We can join
[10/9/23, 1:31:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: can murray on board agroverse to the incubator ?😀

[10/10/23, 11:11:28 PM] Gary Teh: *general thoughts on marketing*

A person’s lifespan is very very short in the grander scheme of things 

The *most pathetic thing* a marketer could do is waste a viewer’s precious little attention and convey nothing!

After analyzing past messaging by marketing greats like Steve Jobs, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, this is the common theme:

You are forced to either *strongly agree* or  *strongly disagree*. Whichever the case, their message leaves zero room to simply ignore them

[10/10/23, 11:33:17 PM] Val Lapidus: I liken Trump and Elons approach to marketing as snake oil salesmen.  Their products are shit
[10/10/23, 11:33:52 PM] Val Lapidus: Our product is not shit.  So we shouldn't try to trick our consumer into buying them
[10/10/23, 11:34:03 PM] Gary Teh: Which further emphasis how strong they are at getting their message out even though their product is shit 🤣

[10/10/23, 11:35:58 PM] Gary Teh: When chatting with my friend Dan he mentioned Tesla deliberately stirs up a lot of Controversy on Twitter to get their name out
[10/10/23, 11:36:32 PM] Gary Teh: This is one of their very deliberate publicity stunt 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rS8fFbW57o
[10/10/23, 11:36:51 PM] Val Lapidus: Is that on brand for agroverse?
[10/10/23, 11:37:18 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't think it is, and I don't think it aligns to our core values
[10/10/23, 11:37:31 PM] Val Lapidus: Integrity
[10/10/23, 11:37:41 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure marketing folks who cares will figure something otherwise it doesn’t really matter anyways… the project and the DAo will just run out of cash and go out with a pathetic whimper
[10/10/23, 11:37:50 PM] Val Lapidus: Integrity is counter intuitive to controversy
[10/10/23, 11:38:28 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true 

I can already imagine a few cases when integrity and controversy goes hand in hand

[10/10/23, 11:41:21 PM] Val Lapidus: That's not all that controversial, since his company is named Virgin airlines
[10/10/23, 11:42:26 PM] Val Lapidus: I think our marketing team needs to focus for our cacao nibs on the fact that we are a unique taste that you cannot find in other products on the market
[10/10/23, 11:43:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Maybe offer a promotion if you find a product with same taste as ours we will refund you
[10/10/23, 11:45:31 PM] Gary Teh: Actually might be interesting would be to drag all our token holders into debt if this campaign you propose goes south since we have everybody’s contact details on file. 🤣

I can already imagine a 101 ways I could hack this proposition you just mentioned 🤔🤩
[10/10/23, 11:47:00 PM] Val Lapidus: Taste is subjective.  You will have a hard time proving that it tastes similar
[10/10/23, 11:47:18 PM] Gary Teh: That is the thing. It cuts both ways 🤣

Especially the one from the Dominican Republic that you yourself taste and immediately threw up.  

Lots of the low grade chocolate out there basically taste really nasty if their flavors were not masked by sugar. 

And some of the premium brands are literally serving these kind of Frankenstein chocolate 🧟‍♀️ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/11/23, 3:21:01 PM] Gary Teh: The country of Israeli is on the cusp committing war crimes against the Palestinian civilians living in the Gaza region. 

Bulk of western mass media is simply broadcasting messaging crafted by the politicians in the country of Israel. 

Bulk of the folks I observe in LinkedIn and Facebook have been brainwashed into about supporting isreali war efforts in Gaza 

https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-gaza-is-open-air-prison-israel-violating-international-law-2023-10

@31641075825 is there anyway to channel humanitarian support to provide some basic necessities to Palestinian civilians stuck in Gaza?

I know of folks in our DAO who don’t feel comfortable being dragged into controversial situations 

This is just a nicely presented exit for them to step out of the room if they don’t feel comfortable about what we are doing but feeling too shy due to the peer pressure 🙂

This is a DAO after all and *rage quit* is a feature. People should be encouraged to exercise their autonomy to utilize this feature whenever they feel like it ‎<This message was edited>
[10/11/23, 7:59:27 PM] Gary Teh: Just occurred to me, we already have something that people naturally want 

There is no reason to be paying advertisers fiat to get the word out for our cacao nibs like other tech companies 

Our product itself is the advertisement. 

We just need to come up with a whole bunch of different recipes to fit it for consumption at all the networking events out there. 

Like Cacao liquor 🤩

@14158669401 mentioned the other evening when we were chatting that if we did manage to pull off figuring out how to get such a decentralized operating model to work running a brick and mortar business we should really submit it as a candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize, because it’s going to be the very first of its kind in terms of fundamentally new economic model 🤩

I have some ideas which I will put into a framework which we can use to focus on our DAO member attention on market Agroverse. 

Currently DAO member attention is all over the place and not focused and directed. This is not very helpful when it comes to marketing Agroverse 

Will share the framework  tomorrow 

Thanks for reminding me of this experiment again yesterday @16468233438. Boomz! 👊

 along with events/ campaigns and other related  actions running parallel.
[10/12/23, 1:53:38 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective socialism means people get to free ride without getting their ass kicked

You got really lucky with your timing dude all the other folks from the meetup that want to join our DAO now have to pay a toll (one way or another) to get into our channels 🤣

    - either await interview to be onboarded into one of our existing roles 

    - or pay USD100 before being allowed in

My sense is from this point forth, it is going to get more and more demanding to qualify for entry into our DAO

If that not the case, the artwork has go be done by renowned artist or the narrative of the project or some indication saying it has potential has  be super strong for be to buy.

[10/19/23, 12:04:17 AM] Gary Teh: I feel that the next phase of our DAO’s evolution would be to define very specific online as well as in real life protocol for social interactions 

And whenever they are executed by any DAO members, governance tokens are automatically awarded 🙂🙏

@31641075825 is already executing on V1 of our *daily social media post protocol* 

@918017107841 is in the process of defining *customer returns protocol* that web3 interns can execute upon to earn governance tokens

The more different faces we can show within our community video the merrier 

People drinking our chocolate will know there is actually a very very large community helping make this project possible 

This is the script that we are all reciting from 🙂🙏

[10/20/23, 1:38:13 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 mentioned that a T-shirt will cost USD30 to print 

The cheapest way to test how viable this guerilla style marketing tactic would work would be for me to just go manually test this in the street of SF.

If we are able to generate 14+6 bags of cacao nibs of sale just by me doing my *Hobo thing* along *haight street* over the course of two weeks, this means this approach is both sustainable and scalable 

The sale covered the cost of the shirt as well as the cost of providing the *leather tramp* 1 meal a day 🤩

Sale of *6 bags* to cover cost of short 
Sale of *1 bag* a day to cover cost to feed the leather tramp ‎<This message was edited>

Why not get him a t-shirt for this venture? The CPM value (ad impressions per thousand) will far exceed the $20 (or les) that it will take to get a t-shirt made

    - our market messaging 
    - the 4 profiles we should be keeping in mind for our messaging and their corresponding CTA
    - the mechanics of how we are right now running our marketing efforts 
    - how we can tap leverage reporters once we have the right CTAs targeted at the right profiles and broadcasted in the right channels (with the help of reporters)

[10/25/23, 3:40:38 AM] Gary Teh: I was having a chat over the phone just now with both my parents back in Singapore. 

I shared about the 0% sales conversion rate last Friday. 🤦‍♂️🤣

Strangely my dad immediately focused on a totally different metric. *did people like what they tasted at the sampling event?* 

My response: Yes they did. “Perfect score then” was his response  

Though I still remain skeptic. until I see actual sales taking place, I will default assume the *Yes* I am hearing is basically a polite *No* in disguise. I have been suckered too many times with this phenomena I just described 

Me and @16468233438 for purpose for our experiment will attempt to offload our entire inventory at the forthcoming night market happening on the 1st of November. 

Dad seems as bullish as @16468233438 about that forthcoming. I remain skeptical until the actual sales data gathered after the event. 

Dad proceeded to explain the parameters he was actively monitoring when he and mum scaled the meat distribution business in Singapore back in the early 80s

*High Level Heuristics*

    - don’t overinvest in infrastructure unless sales volume justifies it 

    - don’t over delay the investment in infrastructure as sales volume scales to such an extend it hampers growth 

    - the food distribution is a retention business more than it is an growth above all else business. Quality Control is hyper critical. ‎<This message was edited>
‎[10/25/23, 3:41:16 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/25/23, 3:51:14 AM] Gary Teh: he proceeded to share the scaling process both of them went through for their food distribution business in the 80s and 90s as well as the scaling process of 3 to 4 of the larger consumer brands in Singapore. 

Amazingly those brands went through the same process as we are doing right now. Two of them started with very very small batch of 5kg produce initially brought in from China

As I listen through the case studies he presented, it occurred to me that without realizing it, we have cracked a very critical component in the Agroverse network without realizing it. 

We have managed to successfully establish a trickling stream of inbound suppliers. 

And the virality baked right into the heart of our DAO is starting pull in more suppliers from regions of the world that we are targeting to source from for our Agroverse network. 

Once we successfully crack the buy side, my sense is the self compounding effect of our network and its virality will become more and more pronounced ‎<This message was edited>

[10/25/23, 4:00:57 AM] Val Lapidus: Let's think in the short term just the Bay area.  That has about 7million and is most comparable to Singapore.  The rest is far spread out
[10/25/23, 4:02:52 AM] Gary Teh: True. If we can establish a proper foothold in the Bay Are and stabilize it, we can start looking at LA next.

Portland thereafter

This city by city expansion pattern starts feeling a lot similar to  pattern described by @6598383264 that Chinese companies follow to expand across China 
    - tier 1 cities 
    - tier 2 cities
    - tier 3 cities

*Another key insight*
Enterprise customers they acquired initially came as consumers visiting their food stall at the wet market 

Enterprise customers once established will predictably order in bulk ‎<This message was edited>

It was a very interesting experience, I got my hands very dirty scaling a database as well as an entire ETL infrastructure to handle the crazy volume of data harvested from the open web

    *Action item 2* - floating our governance tokens for sale by DAO members / buyback by DAO ‎<This message was edited>

[10/26/23, 8:18:55 PM] Jonathan: @14153000019 i have been trying to keep up with the results of the sponsoring of the events. Sorry if I am missing a lot. Am I right that people love the cacao but hard to sell any at the events? Do you have a table with a sign where you try to sell with a big sign at the events? Do they let you do a quick talk before the speakers start about our DAO story? Do we have some charity that we give a very small percentage of the proceeds to like displaced children of Cocoa farmers or something? That can help in the beginning so people feel like by buying the cocoa they are also helping a cause on top of fighting the exploration of cocoa farmers.
[10/26/23, 8:26:58 PM] Jonathan: If you were providing cocoa at an event I was organizing I would put a small line in the poster saying ‘Hear the story of how TrueSight DAO is revolutionizing the supply chain for Cocoa farmers in Latin America and taste their product. I would give you five minutes at the beginning of the event to talk about the DAO. I would then give you a seat at a table on the side where you would put up your banner and sell your product. I am guessing this is along the lines of what is happening but just giving input from a web3 event organizer point of view.  I had you there selling product at a table then it would give some credibility to my event and it might attract other cool sponsors that wanted to sell their product

[10/26/23, 11:11:40 PM] Gary Teh: Mostly @16468233438 

As mentioned I am not a very sociable person when surrounded by too many people at the same time… my brain’s *fight or flight* mechanism just kicks into override. 

Somehow for @16468233438 it seems to be triggering the release of dopamine in his brain instead. 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

[10/27/23, 1:05:23 AM] Val Lapidus: We need to focus on what our goal is for each event.  You can't go to a tech event and try to sell cacao nibs.  You want to sell cacao names? We need to find a keto foods event.  At these events where it's tech events, the right path to approach is to gain Instagram followers and tell our message about how we utilize web3 for our project.  We are exploring also the idea of creating stalls for farmers markets where we will sell hot chocolate.  And then once proving out that use case that that is a profitable method, we will set up a franchising opportunity for others to open their own stalls within their own farmers markets

[10/29/23, 3:41:04 AM] Jonathan: I think you could follow the eggnog way - "If you would like to add alcohol to your eggnog, choose a drink with a high alcohol concentration to help counterbalance the sweetness of the eggnog.  Common choices of alcohol to add to eggnog include brandy, rum, bourbon or whisky."
[10/29/23, 3:41:43 AM] Jonathan: While brandy is the most traditional alcohol to pair with eggnog, according to traditional recipes, you can also use a mixture of dark rum and Cognac. If you like your eggnog with more of a kick you can also add bourbon, but we recommend sticking to rum and Cognac to preserve the 'nog's flavors
[10/29/23, 3:42:28 AM] Jonathan: Brandy: Makes the Most Traditional Eggnog
For the most traditional holiday experience, reach for brandy (specifically, Cognac) to spike your 'nog. It's important to note, though, that both brandy and eggnog are quite sweet. Combining them will produce something that someone with a sweet tooth will love, but that others may find cloying. Proceed with caution.
[10/29/23, 3:44:25 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Thanks for sharing! 🤩🙏

More voting rights and governance tokens for both of you! 💸💰💵💶💷💴🤑

I noticed people get really sated after drinking 2 drinks of hot Choclate. 

What people really want at these events is a drink they can keep drinking the entire night without feeling full in the stomach 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

And it fits in the *three sided network effects* strategy I have mind which also incorporates the PR framework that @971564644817 shared

[10/31/23, 3:32:07 AM] Gary Teh: Started consuming this bar of magic mushroom laced chocolate (one small chunk every evening) which @17755088150 gifted me last Halloween when I was passing through Portland Oregon. It’s effect had been truly fascinating 

You literally feel nothing different than you would consuming a regular chunk of chocolate, but two three hours post consumption, patterns that were staring straight me in the face for a long long time that I have been blind to suddenly became obvious 🤯

My friend who is a master forager has been conducting master classes where he teaches people how to turn acorn into tortillas.  he charges USD80 per person and it’s a full class of 20 people for 6 hours. Basically USD1200 of net profit per session 

https://youtu.be/rmulfscDVNU?si=1SHx9rEvtzpEWERB

I don’t see why we shouldn’t occasionally run classes where we charge the same amount for teaching people how to make choclate from cacao nibs 

It’s a novelty that even Jerry and his kids find fascinating enough to want to do everytime I go visit them 🤯

I wouldn’t mind moving front one hippie colony to the next conducting classes like these. It would be quite fun and not as equipment intensive as the idea that @16468233438 suggested 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/31/23, 11:48:53 AM] Gary Teh: I notice such kind of *psychological profiles* tends to not the most suitable as domestic partners, especially if they are expected to play the role of the *bread winner* in the domestic arrangement. 

Their ultra risk taking behavior tends to send their domestic partners scrambling in panic in the opposite direction as and when they go through one of those *100% conviction* episodes 

Reminds me of Alex Honnold who is well know for his free solo activities (rock climbing without use of safety harnesses)

[11/2/23, 12:58:34 PM] Gary Teh: The security guard at yesterday’s night market suggested we apply for a store at the weekly Sunday market at the same exact location

Usual foot traffic is around 2000 to 3000 people per event

[11/2/23, 1:19:07 PM] Gary Teh: Looks nice and warm! 

What do you have in mind on how future events like this could fit into the much larger picture for our network effects to amp up the value of our governance tokens?? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/2/23, 1:23:15 PM] Iwona Fluda: We are planning to organize similar events globally in the coming months, so there is lots of potential, including but not limited to:
[11/2/23, 1:23:38 PM] Iwona Fluda: here are the ideas that Chat GPT gave me:
    Token Integration: Incorporating governance tokens into the fabric of the summit activities, allowing participants to earn tokens through meaningful contributions, engagement in discussions, and by providing valuable feedback.

    Community Building: Using the tokens to build a sense of ownership and community among the attendees. This can encourage ongoing participation and investment in the network, as each member will have a stake in the collective success.

    Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices through a tokenized platform can ensure that the value generated at the summit extends beyond the event itself, contributing to a growing body of collective intelligence.

    Collaborative Innovation: Encouraging participants to propose and develop projects that align with the summit's goals, with governance tokens acting as a means for the community to vote and decide on the projects they find most promising.

    Continuity and Growth: By connecting each event to the next through governance tokens, we can create a continuous loop of value creation and sharing. This can lead to more significant advancements and breakthroughs in the fields we are passionate about.

    Network Expansion: As the community and its governance token system mature, the network effect can attract more talent and resources, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that grows in value with each event and interaction.
[11/2/23, 1:23:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: :D
[11/2/23, 1:23:44 PM] Iwona Fluda: What do you think?
[11/2/23, 1:35:13 PM] Gary Teh: Surfacing tasks required by our DAO at the event that participants can engage in to earn governance tokens would be great! 🤩🙏

What are the type of folks that have signed up so far?
[11/2/23, 1:45:22 PM] Iwona Fluda: geniuses, visionaries and in general amazing individuals 🌟
[11/2/23, 3:03:05 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Event is posted to start at 4pm. Speaking section will start around 5. So 4ish a good. Thanks!
[11/2/23, 3:22:05 PM] Gary Teh: Got it. See you there! 🙂🙏
[11/2/23, 3:22:18 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks!
[11/2/23, 3:22:43 PM] Gary Teh: Do you have a profile list handy? That way we can start shortlisting a bunch of quests we can immediately surface at the event
[11/2/23, 4:07:06 PM] Iwona Fluda: No, we`re not sharing the profile list of the participants.
[11/2/23, 4:07:37 PM] Iwona Fluda: I need to discuss it all with my business partner on Monday.

[11/3/23, 2:33:51 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 when is the next follow up?
[11/3/23, 2:36:56 PM] Suheil - Europe: We followed up they send me an application to submit for the program didn't submit it yet
[11/3/23, 2:41:03 PM] Gary Teh: When are you planning to do that and what are you looking to acquire for our DAO from them?
[11/3/23, 2:42:08 PM] Suheil - Europe: It's an accelerator program
[11/3/23, 2:42:10 PM] Suheil - Europe: Market Making Pro and WOW Summit have launched the WOW Summit Growth Program with a grant of 1,000,000 USD for founders, as well as the MMPro Experts Program for WEB3 industry professionals.

Details can be found here: Market Making Pro Experts Press Release

Participating projects receive additional benefits, including:
1. Evaluation of projects by leading industry experts.
2. Consultations on projects from Pre-seed to Series B.
3. Bonuses and opportunities for all participants during the bull run.
4. A grant of up to $1 million USD from the MMPro team.
5. A 15% discount from WOW Summit on all sponsorship packages and two standard tickets.
6. Informational support from key partners of WOW SUMMIT and MMPRO.

To start the Expert Audit, we need to gather and compile information about your projects for the Experts.

➡️ Fill out the participant form
[11/3/23, 2:46:00 PM] Gary Teh: I noticed the traditional jargon for the use of *founder* seem to be very pervasive 

Besides calling all governance token holders *contributors* we should just call them *founders* well

So technically we have close to 300 governance token holders (aka founders)

Just go ahead and apply as you would a *founder* 🤣

I noticed that @14152032783also listed @13104674556 as founder on the event sheet created for this Sunday’s event 

@16468233438 also asked if he could use the founder title at some point 

Let’s just democratize the use of the term *founder* within our DAO 🤩

You are all *founders*… 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/3/23, 9:46:50 PM] Alessandro Mele: Curious to see how the “Source principles” would apply to Agroverse ….. according to the theory developed by Peter Koenig there is only One Source for any human project or initiative, the person who has the idea and takes the first step / risk to make it happen. The Source then invited other people into the “field”, the vision for the project / initiative, in order to realise it. People come in as either other sources (realising their own idea / vision within the field) or employees (simply providing time / talent for salary). How did the idea of the DOA started? Who took the first step to realise it?!
[11/3/23, 9:48:58 PM] Gary Teh: Well, I guess that is where we should check our ledger 🤣

https://Edgar.TrueSight.me/ledger
[11/3/23, 9:50:20 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO has went through a bunch of evolution 

Initially a few key principles were just surfaced during random conversations and they somehow started forming a *Mandelbrot pattern* which just kept on growing on its own

Those key principles have been applied by the various individuals independently for along time prior. But somewhere somehow they collided within the network and the crystallization started happening ‎<This message was edited>

This abridged (5 slides) version of how our DAO works seem to drive the message through this community and got them really psyched about it

PS: I was just throwing these slides together to answer your question just now and realized they were having lightning talks this evening at the HackerDojo 

What a synchronicity 🤩

[11/5/23, 6:04:59 AM] Gary Teh: What do you mean by tagged?
[11/5/23, 6:06:23 AM] Gary Teh: Actually when I think about it, DAO voting is not really necessary for spinning up such kinds of system as it’s basically individual members exercising their own personal *Autonomy* ‎<This message was edited>

@13104674556 whose family had been in the cacao business mentioned it was one of the highest quality cacao he has ever sampled 

He also mentioned it’s very child friendly 

@16504369509 mentioned if it’s to be received by the American palette it needs to be way sweeter  than it currently is

[11/6/23, 1:49:42 AM] Jonathan: Last time I made about 10 of the and brought them to the US which was not fun. The difference in cost though is big. $200 in the US vs $13 in China. However, there is a huge difference in quality.
[11/6/23, 1:50:06 AM] Jonathan: I understand why they are so expensive in the US as they are very sturdy with great covers.
[11/6/23, 1:52:02 AM] Jonathan: Great. If someone is every going to HK, I would be willing to make some here in Shenzhen and hand them over for return in the US if we are still doing things cheap and cheery at that point. Something to keep in mind as the sales expand to more than one city.
[11/6/23, 1:55:32 AM] Gary Teh: I believe if we do successfully scale sales the next thing we will  be looking at is getting our packaging printed in Shenzhen

The sweetness reference was more for if the cocoa was explored for use in our street outreach in the Tenderloin. Overall I felt the sweetness of the hot cocoa last night was perfect for me. I’m sure there’s plenty more taste testing to be had and learning from others but I loved last night’s offering. Thanks for brewing it up @16468233438 🙏

We don’t need to waste our time chasing after them

[11/8/23, 3:51:55 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has recently exercised her *autonomy* to create a new Wix based website for our main community site at TrueSight.me as Shadi has been busy with work and couldn’t find time to continue building out the Wordpress based community site 

I think her efforts at exercising her *autonomy* to creatively solve a problem was commendable 🙂🙏
[11/8/23, 3:53:27 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, more of these *autonomous* actions are beneficial for our DAO and also encourages *Diversity* within our ecosystem 

*Diversity* is one of our core values

[11/9/23, 2:03:58 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform 

What a match made in heaven!! 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 3:50:24 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s get his and Micheal’s feedback 

If they feel receptive enough about it then we can trail tested it
[11/10/23, 3:58:56 AM] Gary Teh: I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

Just some random ideas to popped into my mind just now 🤷‍♂️🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 6:15:22 AM] Iwona Fluda: The question is if they were warned about next steps/ if they were aware of this possibility. If not, I fully understand them. 

I understand that it sometimes seems that we live in a “cancel culture”, but I totally don’t get why we shouldn’t act differently individually and collectively. - just a thought. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 6:19:56 AM] Gary Teh: They probably thought the rules that were voted into our constitution/white paper did not apply to them or thought they could probably get away with breaking rules once these have been voted into place 

Or they came into the ecosystem before those ruled were put in place and did not bother to keep abreast of rule changes that have been voted into effect 

The folks that stuck around modified their behavior to fit the rules once informed 

Those that left because they suddenly realized there was no more value to be derived and there was nothing they want to contribute in the first place. They were just in here for sales lead generation to power their own business models. 

They opted to leave. Though we do have a three strikes and you are out policy. They did not even get to strike 2 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 6:22:45 AM] Iwona Fluda: So the question is to all of us: Do you read all the terms and conditions when you join a group of people?

[11/10/23, 6:24:32 AM] Iwona Fluda: When we talk about strikes: which rules did I break that it caused me being kicked out of the Agroverse Guilt without warning?
[11/10/23, 6:24:58 AM] Gary Teh: Notice how the trickle in of folks in our channels have slowed recently?

I started requiring prospects keen to join our channels to read our white paper to understand our rules first
[11/10/23, 6:25:26 AM] Gary Teh: You were not being kicked out but rotated out 

The guild have a different set of rules that were voted in  

A maximum capacity of 8

When a new active members need to join, the least active is invited out 

All the other seven were active on some ongoing tasks ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 6:33:56 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. @557391090002 was recently invited out because when we did an audit amongst ourselves he had no active scope 

Happy to introduce 1 more guild member who can commit time on a weekly basis in there.  

I know @972543523823 would be the 8th person but @31641075825 basically interfaces all the communications for her and she rarely goes into group chats

I am aware Emelin is trying to onboard a new designer she can work directly with. Not sure if that 8th should be used for him since feels like Emelin will be interfacing with the new designer if he wants to join 

But otherwise from what I am aware of so far we need these two additional roles

_Role 1_
a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 6:38:01 AM] Gary Teh: Happy for anyone who would like to exercise *autonomy* by defining a active role for himself/herself to take on within the scope of Agroverse to join the guild to help advance the  project 🙂🙏

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

_PS: Also please don’t self define a role of being a manager to oversee other members._

_The guild size is small enough that members should be able to self manage and self execute once given the instructions manual on how to operate some functions_ 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/13/23, 5:02:05 AM] Gary Teh: *Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/13/23, 5:12:22 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of brutal, Open Sea just laid off 50% of their employees 2 days ago.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-staff-severance-version-2-0-launch

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.

[11/14/23, 5:20:16 PM] Gary Teh: Additional insights from Ray Wu (Y-Combinator Alumni) 

*key insights*
    - tech scene is so abysmal right now no one wants to think about it that is why a lot of tech folks are looking into the FnB space 

    - VCs don’t really do much except _sell the money_ they took from someone else (_Limited Partners_) for hopefully at least a 3X return to keep their job. They market themselves as _value adding_ to try sell their money at a premium to unsuspecting founders but actually not much value add in hindsight

- people come in at seed and pre-seed with the belief in the _greater fool theory_ that someone will buy out their position at Series A for a 3X return. 

- bulk of the rich folks belong to the NATO category by default (_no action talk only_). See them for what they are. Tap on their network of relationships if applicable otherwise be judicious in deployment of operator’s (_person who actually executes_) time beyond what is necessary to maintain the relationship ‎<This message was edited>

[11/19/23, 2:08:22 AM] Gary Teh: I am aware that the cooperative we are working with in Brazil have been actively exploring this concept with a supposed tech solutions provider while I was there

Unfortunately based on what I understood later on, the tech solutions provider ghosted on them... (_ghosting seem to be a prevalent phenomena in the web3 space… I had even offered to meetup with the tech solutions provider to explore collaborate while I was there… but to no avail…_) 

The upside is, once we have proven the end to end model for Agroverse that door is right now left wide open for us to step right in to fill up that gaping hole left by the tech solutions provider. 

According to our new _4 rules rubric system_ we should in principle award governance token to the tech solutions provider that ghosted on the cooperative. 

This is because he did spend time educating the market on our behalf… he just did not deliver on his promise… 🤔🤣

*_Outcome*_

- he is keen to chip in USD1000-2000 play money on the next inbound shipment of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs. He is very intrigued that we have been able to break into supply chain which has been historically a very opaque industry and making it transparent by using blockchain  

- ⁠he will setup a minimal viable @120363045796860099@g.us offgrid power facility at his place in Santa Cruz. I just need to ship over a bitcoin miner to run our proof of concept to test the entire end to end before we go for V1 in slab city this coming winter 

- ⁠he mentioned his uncle has been able to build an industrial grade data feed for cryptocurrency pricing. It might be useful for Edgar’s actual engine since we are right now missing the cryptocurrency data feed

[5/4/24, 1:53:56 PM] Gary Teh: I attended this Cacao ceremony in Davos earlier this year

After attending a few cacao ceremonies here is what I observed. 

The pattern is similar to how jazz music became bossa nova, when it’s brought to Brazil and how Buddhism evolved to become Zen when it spread from India to China and later to Japan

When an idea spreads into a new culture, the community will incorporate elements of their own culture into the idea to come up with their own interpretation.

[5/4/24, 3:16:02 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 1 hour maintaining data pipeline for Edgar’s engine. data pipeline was broken since 27th April. 

- Lost news sentiment data since that date
- ⁠lost market pricing data since that date

Root cause
- one of the Redis server ran out of working memory and started failing
- ⁠new data gathering jobs could not be written to memory and thus crawling was affected ‎<This message was edited>

[5/5/24, 2:56:55 AM] Gary Teh: Didn’t realized I was going to be attending a cacao ceremony until I did this evening here in Mount Shasta 

Met Willow, a shaman who was leading the cacao activation this evening. She ended up buying a pound of cacao. She got really excited when she realized I had with me a new strain of cacao she never had before. 

She also suggested that she needs my help to certify the Ecuador farm that she is currently bringing in cacao from because the import and sales is technically illegal. 

She is a traveling healer diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and only has two and a half years of lifespan left  

*_Recurring patterns observed*_

- healers who specialize in pain management 

- ⁠uses cacao as a gift

- ⁠curious to try more varieties of cacao  

- ⁠female in late forties and early fifties 

- ⁠attends ecstatic dance 

- ⁠there is always an altar at these ecstatic dance sessions dedicated to *_Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva*_ who expounded the *_Heart Sutra*_

- ⁠there seem to be a cultural convergence between the *_Heart Sutra*_ and *_Cacao, medicine of the Heart*_ or some call it Heart resonance
[11/25/23, 3:13:26 AM] Gary Teh: The community at the green gulch zen monastery I am right now having my zen training at figured we make some crunchy aromatic late night cacao nibs cookies 🤩

[11/26/23, 8:42:18 PM] Gary Teh: Something I observed about the way work is structured around these work session teams at the Zen monastery I have been studying these past few days

*_simplicity*_
The task at each position is simple and well defined. Which allows easy build up of muscle memory after 3-4 iteration by a person executing that the role

Also the number of roles are very very limited since the overall scope of operations was deliberately kept to a minimal as is the signature characteristic of Zen inspired designs 

*_ease of role switching*_
Since these roles are designed to be simple, anyone could easily swap in and swap out of those roles (_which happens on a weekly basis_). 

This also makes it possible for a guest student who has just joined the community for a 2 week period to quickly get into the hang of any assigned role after 2-3 days and start being productive by day 4

*_pairing*_
Someone more experienced in a role is paired with someone new to a role. 

I have observed similar process before in engineering teams called _pair programming_ where an engineer more experienced with a codebase is paired up with an incoming engineer that is new to the codebase to quickly onboard the new engineer 

*_redundancy*_
There is a healthy level of redundancy built into the system design. 

7-8 people are loaded into a scope that could be easily handled by 3-4 people ‎<This message was edited>

[11/27/23, 2:12:21 AM] Gary Teh: Well.. seems it’s less intense here than the *_Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat_* which clocks *_10 hours per day*_. 🤣

Based data collected from the past seven days, it is an average of only 5 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day. Plus another 5 hours of meditation while actively attending to simple chores around the temple and the farm.

One thing I am really curious would be to volunteer as a server for one of the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat once I get back to the Bay Area again after my upcoming trip to Davos. 

That will help give first hand knowledge on how the logistic side of Vipassana retreat works (_heard from @14153096839 that no one is allowed to talk there even as a server_) 

And then as a third data point, finally attend the workshop conducted at the Spiritual Science Research Foundation in Goa as recommended by @41765663130 

My hypothesis is in-depth _*qualitative analysis_* of three such system should help provide enough data points to help triangulate at a high level the key components needed for a volunteer based self managing and self sustaining organization. 🤔

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

This is especially both of you will be very heavily involved on the European side of the supply chain as well as Swiss association matters 

@31641075825 I am asking @41799155602 if the three of us could meet up at his place after me and @41799155602 finished visiting WEF in Jan 

That way we could really discuss about next steps for Europe 

Please feel free to proceed without presence during this period while i am in zen retreat
[5/14/24, 12:39:24 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the bus kings will be touring Oregon this summer and autumn 

Daniel spent bulk of the evening explaining how the eeed growing business he used to run works as well as the local market dynamics for psilocybin mushrooms in Oregon 

https://youtu.be/OB-wxZdlJxU?si=blGq6atWeT4ZnmwH

Even thought weed is officially legalized, weed from the legal channels are of poorer quality and more expensive. Legal distributors need to pay government their taxes and end up needing to cut back on quality 

Meanwhile weed off the black market is of way higher quality but at 50% the price since no taxes were paid to the government and more money could be deployed to generate higher quality output 

_PS: Black Market price for psilocybin mushroom in Portland Oregon is USD2.50 per gram compared to USD10 per gram out there in the Arizona desert 🤯_

If USA market is receptive and there is sufficient profit margin that makes it commercially viable for DAO to bring into USA via Agroverse infrastructure, I will pay a visit to your farm to certify it for imports into USA under USA government FDA regulation 🙂🙏

[12/5/23, 8:17:03 AM] Anupa/diya: @41765663130 Thanks for the great chat. Looking into Purpose initiative : skillsharing and advisory roles within the DAO. Planning an online workshop on the possibilities to evaluate the role of the sharer. Time: 1 HR
[5/22/24, 8:33:39 AM] Janet: US has a wide national security implications

[5/22/24, 8:33:49 AM] Janet: I’m here in US
[12/5/23, 1:26:21 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. Top 10 DAO member who has accumulated the most number of tokens over the past 180 days based on our 4 rules based rubric system

_The 4 rules_
    - 100 TDG: per hour 
    - 1 TDG: per USD
    - hours contributed based on self reporting
    - USD contributed, please submit receipt ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 8:20:41 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Indeed. Let’s train and automate Edgar…
[5/22/24, 9:15:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I'm not home now but as soon as I get I will work in a post so we can share through social media. First thing, I need to know where he was last seen or known to be.
[12/5/23, 8:22:01 PM] Gary Teh: The cost of training and automating Edgar is very high 

Unless we are managing a community large fund using Edgar, it actually doesn’t make sense
[5/22/24, 9:15:50 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Was it in South America?
[12/5/23, 8:22:29 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Could we spec it out?

Perhaps makes sense to just create a new channel dedicated to Edgar and dump such kind of content in there

[12/7/23, 5:39:39 PM] Gary Teh: *_Observation at the Zen monastery*_

I had the opportunity to study how the *_sangha*_ (_monastic community_) works 

Specific forms occur at recurring specific time of the day, these are those:

    - communal food
    - study time 
    - meditation time 
    - housekeeping time 
    - operating chores 

The only thing that is compulsory for all to engage in is housekeeping 

As for the rest whether the residents all turn up for them it is up to the exercise of their *_autonomy*_

For residents who are keen the schedule is visibly displayed on the way 

I noticed not all monastic residents show all the time for all meditation or study sessions

But since all residents were self selecting they are generally motivated to follow the schedule which is designed to enhance their spiritual practice 

_*How that translates to DAO*_
Feel free to come up with a schedule and a meeting venue 

If DAO members are keen they can turn up 

If DAO members are not keen they don’t need to turn up 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/7/23, 8:45:27 PM] Gary Teh: I am exercising my *Autonomy* by minimizing my FaceTime for now

When I look at my personal historical data collected over the past 12 months, these FaceTime sessions somehow always occur right when US stock market starts trading. 

The personal cost (_disrupted trades amounting to more than USD20K_) of these FaceTime far outweighs the value generated so far 🤔

I conclude asynchronous communication works best for me. 

Also asynchronous communications allows the space for the messenger to deliver the full message and then ample time for me to fully read and contemplate on the message before replying

Finally side observation these past three weeks, when I deliberately step back, it creates the space that allows other DAO members to step forward. I observed this too as a common practice here in the sangha ‎<This message was edited>

[12/8/23, 9:51:57 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 I have given some more thoughts on personal resource allocation, since you are there covering India there is really no strong compelling reason to be there for @120363044028036610@g.us purpose 

I will more likely than not take a rain check on India for now

[12/9/23, 10:36:50 AM] Gary Teh: The key characteristics of *_compassion*_ is the person who is triggered to action must also have had suffered in the same way as the other that is being observed. 

It is thus not *_sympathy*_ but *_empathy*_ 

*_Sympathy*_: I have never experienced your type of suffering. I don’t really feel how you are feeling. I am just doing a donation right now just to feel good about myself. 

*_Empathy*_: I have been through that same type of suffering and I know how painful it is. I can feel it right now myself just by seeing your suffering. I am naturally triggered to stop the pain. 

You are experiencing the physical pain. We are both experiencing the psychology pain.

@436608133615 these might be elements that you want to consider to incorporate for your *_encrypted gods*_ game design as well

Rather than attempt to sell it perhaps just order as much as possible and then store them somewhere in our decentralized warehousing facility  

Buyers will come knocking on the door at some point when they realize our prices have became competitive just because of market price changes

Then we can start offloading the cacao from our network of warehouses

DAO members get compensated for storage 

Based on my understanding from the folks from the cooperative, Cacao butter can technically be store forever 

Also an active sales team is no longer needed. We just need yo find more folks who are keen to offer their place for cacao storage purposes ‎<This message was edited>

_PS: I was thinking if everyone in the DAO migrated over to the House of Balance there would technically be no further need to maintain TrueSight DAO or any of its channels_

_the values are quite aligned though the set of activities pursued are somewhat different_

_So long as no attempt is made to pursue any commercial enterprises, there is technically no need to maintain the tokens if everything is gift and donation based._

_At some point, we should even consider donating what is left of our USDT treasury to the community events they seek to organize once a year_ ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 3:35:25 PM] Gary Teh: DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them.

[12/12/23, 4:58:35 PM] Gary Teh: My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 7:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: Negative statements are more *qualifiers* than they are *action rules*. 


_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples 


_scenario with qualifer and actual action associated_

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree. 

- *key action*: gather apples from apple trees in garden 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck the blue apples ‎<This message was edited>

[12/13/23, 10:15:07 PM] Gary Teh: Spent past 4 hours creating Python script to automate scoring of Member submissions into WhatsApp channels utilizing OpenAi

_*Location of code base*_
- https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/contribution_scoring/blob/main/Sandbox.ipynb



_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

_Scoring for Town Hall Submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQg09aFTlyUNez3w1GHX4GCQ6b1P3jaUz52z29TUHcw/edit#gid=2120247626



_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels

[12/13/23, 11:09:41 PM] Gary Teh: _thoughts for some far fetched future_

What will be interesting at some point would be to notarize all these submission records on to our own TrueChain (_Proof of Authority based EVM variant_) 

Records to be tokenized will be approved by one of the *_10 Governors*_ system appointed each season. There will be a user interface provided where governors can indicate their approval

Once governor indicates approval, TDG tokens on TrueChain will be automatically issued to DAO member’s Metamask wallet address on file 

DAO member can opt to keep their TDG holdings on TrueChain or request for DAO to have their TDG holdings transferred to either the Solana or Ethereum chain

the story becomes more mulitfaced and richer, definitely even more enjoyable to tell than the one we are currently telling about Agroverse(_even though the current story is already a very entertaining one to tell_) 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/20/23, 4:23:01 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I think we can test it out across different demographics.

We have a new breed of millennial farmers that might be quite receptive. Their approach to agriculture is different.

The older generations have issues with trust particularly with matters to do with land.

The signals seem to be clearer and clearer as they flow in. I definitely need to further take a step back and let go of the reins of the DAO. 

*Integrity* of DAO will evolve to become crowd sourced amongst DAO members and enabled using AI. 

Thus far what I am seeing seems to indicate that my stepping back and letting go of the rein is eliciting the desired effect.

Let’s just propose for millennial farmer friends of yours who plant new trees on their property, to take a photo of the new tree they planted and then emailed the photo to support@agroverse.shop. If they do, they will be awarded governance tokens in our DAO.

That is the minimal action that we should verify can be easily adopted.

Their action will by default provide us with the following details

- email address of farmer
- ⁠Date time stamp (embedded in email header)
- GPS location of tree (embedded in photo attachment)
- ⁠image of tree (embedded in photo attachment) ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 12:21:09 PM] Sarah H.: If everyone is okay with me doing that
[12/20/23, 4:50:58 AM] Gary Teh: Later on when we have an AI listening in on a WhatsApp channel, we could have the behavior even more seamless, they could just text the photos to the WhatsApp phone number associated with the AI. Once they do, the scoring gets automated.
[5/22/24, 12:21:10 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, please, Sarah.
[12/20/23, 5:00:33 AM] Gary Teh: Based according to the principles of the @120363044542957540@g.us , Users should not be forced to behave any differently from how they already are right now 

However what happens in the background should be quietly shifted over to the new paradigm without the need of their awareness

Reminds me of this Zen proverb: “_Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water._

_After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water_.” 

Examined using the naked eye nothing has changed 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/20/23, 11:36:43 AM] Gary Teh: If and When they plant new trees on their farm, would they be keen to take a photo of the new tree they planted and then emailed the photo to support@agroverse.shop. If they do, they will be awarded governance tokens in our DAO.
[5/22/24, 12:23:17 PM] Emelin - Bahia: That's helpful!
[12/20/23, 2:20:36 PM] Gary Teh: Had a 10 minutes chat with @16468233438 just now

He has been calling up the chocolatiers in the USA 

Seems their minimal order quantity is 100KG and their price point is nothing more than USD6 per kg 

We been reexamining the cost components of our supply chain

Seems we are paying a lot more for freighting than we are for the cacao itself 

The freighting is still using diesel which is not very environmentally friendly supply chain wise 

@16468233438 floated the idea of perhaps owning our own ship. 

@41765663130 mentioned he is planning to sail the carribeans end of January and then head over to Columbia to visit the indigenous 

Wind powered transportation is definitely very eco friendly 🤔

Seems the universe is surfacing some really interesting signals again 🤩

It suggests redirecting resources to support indigenous and farmers as an alternative 

And for companies to start focus on actually cutting emissions instead of planting trees to get more credits (_*green washing*_) ‎<This message was edited>

Large scale tree planting initiatives for carbon capture purposes often *_disrupt the existing biodiversity*_ in the ecosystem where they are planted

Cost of the following types of trees saplings 

_We have nurseries that do the grafting and nurturing where we make our purchases_.

- Macadamia - 300 kes
- Avocado - 350-450 kes
- Wambugu apple - 1000 kes
- Peach - 10000kes

_All fruit trees come with different prices._

[12/24/23, 1:49:15 PM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 spent an hour gathering the following information for @120363044028036610@g.us for macadamia nuts 

I am sorry for sharing this in your inbox, it is too much for the hall.


From farmers, the prices have been varying from 80kes to 100kes per kg of the raw product. I will share a photo from our farm.

However, depending on the level of value addition the bags in supermarkets go for 600kes to over 800kes for 250grams. This value add is typically roasting and salting.

For the very premium ones, they go for as high as 250 kes for 30grams.

I will share some photos below.

I requested a quote from an epz that does the cracking of the nuts in tonnes. I am waiting for their response.

[5/22/24, 1:09:58 PM] Sarah H.: Yaaas
[12/28/23, 2:58:08 AM] Gary Teh: I am noticing a recurring pattern… 

ideas and discussions happening in DAO being taken and incorporated into members own independent project 

The most recent one that got surfaced by @41799155602 this morning was by Satheesh (the Ahan project) which borrowed from RnD materials done in Agroverse. The Ahan deck was sent to @41799155602 for fund raising purposes. 

Until @41799155602 surfaced this, I had no idea Satheesh was approaching supporters of Agroverse project to seek financing for an alternate project that had borrowed RnD materials from Agroverse.

This copy and paste phenomena seems to be common in the realms of open source too

_PS: at this point, I am leaning towards being skeptical about the DAO model as a *equitable way* to crowd source for resource to build community projects as the same flaws which exist in open source software operating models are starting to surface in DAO ecosystem as well_

_microsoft for years have been copying and pasting code created in open source projects to build up their OS. Bulk of the market capitalization ended up getting attributed to Microsoft and none of it ever end up getting attributed to these open source efforts_

_as @5511982667030 correctly identified DAO seems to be like a leaky bucket in terms of value generation and capture… value is generated by collective effort but seems to keep getting captured elsewhere_

_I am right now holding off on pouring more personal resources into this leaky bucket until a better alternate variant is discovered…_

_at least it is good to discover a model that doesn’t really work well. This helps us free resources to figure out other models that might work 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 1:10:38 PM] Fatima: We’re in the right track!🙏🏻
[12/28/23, 3:23:47 AM] Gary Teh: If I was a hustler the way I would exploit this network would be to download the entire member contact list and then reach out to every single one of them individually to help  finance my own project… the common term for this phenomena is called “_contacts mining_” as described by @41799155602

However since bulk of the folks here were invited by me into our DAO from my personal network, there is technically no one new for me to *_social mine*_ 🤣 

So whether this DAO continue to exist or not doesn’t really matter for me from a networking perspective as my personal relationship with everyone here will still continue existing regardless 🤔

I think the primary reason for this persistence is I did spent ample time to really know each and every person here as a human being. 🙂🙏

I feel it’s important we learn to stop just treating the next person beside us as just another tool. 

What I observed these three months crashing into some of the networking events in Bay Area just makes me cringe as a human being. 😵 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/28/23, 4:57:48 AM] Vlatko Gigov: This usually happens when you practice maximum transparency. Which has been the case with the DAO since the beginning. It is fine if we are here to support one another and produce spin offs through our participation and chit chat. @5511982667030 rightly points to the leaky bucket analogy. I guess one needs the validation of 100s of ppl to go off on a tangent. Which is again fine. As long as the initial values are preserved. Usually in the begging values are instilled either with an iron fist or a legal bind. Let’s see if we can instil them the hippie way.

Well, Valentine is also a token holding DAO member. And he surfaced yesterday with his workshop!! 🤩

[12/29/23, 9:04:26 PM] Gary Teh: What would actually be interesting would be to get the pricing data for high potential arbitrage opportunity items from exporting countries, pull the historical closing price details from eBay and then verify if there is any margins to be made
[5/22/24, 2:29:46 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Awesome ❤️
[12/29/23, 9:09:23 PM] Gary Teh: Spoke with Angela (_center of photo_) just now while driving her to the gem wholesaler in my car

She handmakes these marijuana pipes that she sells to the weed shops here for a very high margin

She doesn’t want to waste her time hand making them but doesn’t feel confident about finding a supplier that could do it in China that she could trust

I mentioned that I might be popping by China and know a bunch of folks there sometime this year (@8618926086648… _wink wink_…) and we could source for the manufacturer

Might actually pop by to source for a Kraft pouch printing supplier based in China if @120363044028036610@g.us sales volume does go up (_at some point_) 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/1/24, 9:57:49 PM] Gary Teh: Happy new year everybody! 

Spent bulk of today exploring the world’s largest wholesale precious gem fair! 🤩

And it’s totally amazing!! Also managed to bump into an ex-Olympic USA swimmer. She mentioned she will be in Paris to volunteer at the swimming event during summer this year! 

Time spent: 4 hours 

Key insights 

- each spot on the open desert rents for 15 days 

- ⁠renting period officially begins 1 January and last through to February 

- ⁠none precious gen vendors set up as early as October 

- ⁠USA precious gem miners typical work 11 months in a year mining the land they have contracted with state and county until weather turns ultra bad before they seek refuge here in QuartzSite

- ⁠retail price is typically a 100% markup on whole sale price

- ⁠other places where precious gem are sourced from: China, Brazil, Uruguay and Afghanistan

[1/2/24, 10:19:34 AM] Gary Teh: This piece of news does not bode well for our expected trade route from China to Europe for shipping @⁨[project] Agroverse⁩ Kraft pouches now that bulk of shipping is being redirected around the cape of good hope instead of passing through the Sueze canal. 

The fight between Isreal and Hamas which can be seen as a second proxy war between the Western Bloc and the Eastern (_with Russia and Ukraine being the first_) is starting to spread (_otherwise known as WWIII_)

[1/2/24, 1:21:24 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 1 hour today maintaining the Edgar engine to get cleaner signals for news trend to market pricing correlation. One of the components chocked up.

Would be a great opportunity to time a mean reversion trade once the US/ Isreal versus Iran/Hamas tenion eases.

just to be sure….

(1) festival site has no network 
(2) It ended on 20 May (Sun) and 
(3) Gary has stayed behind with the clean up crew to help with the cleaning up…

So Gary might pop up anytime once he has network?? 

If so lets pray and keep all posted.
Thanks
[1/3/24, 5:13:18 PM] Gary Teh: Message from Ray Wu.

_My friend Michael Michelini (based in Chiangmai) has been in eCommerce for years and runs Cross Border Summit. I met him in China years ago._

_He's currently working on loadpipe.com - which is selling on the blockchain. I mentioned your DAO to him. Would you be open to connecting with him? https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemichelini/?originalSubdomain=_

Time take for introduction by him 1 hour

_PS: seems once DAO network achieved some level of critical mass it just ends up self perpetuating_

[1/3/24, 5:38:46 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: @14153000019 Yes well it would be a custom package. It woul be the standard package plus some additional add ons such as AMA, web and mobile banners, inclusion in the newsletter. I could also provide as many comarketing activities as you want, the project sets the budget.
[5/22/24, 4:09:43 PM] Alessandro Mele: 👏👏👏

[5/22/24, 4:09:50 PM] Alessandro Mele: 💙💙💙
[1/3/24, 5:42:04 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The total price would be 10k. The upfront cost can be 3000 USDT + 3000 TDG. to be paid before onboarding.The remaing 4k would have to be paid after the IEO and prior to trading paor going live. 

The balance could be in fiat or a combination of fiat and TDG.

_*My interpretation*: Desert + tons of water = an anomaly that presents an interesting opportunity 🤩_

Will pop by to pay it a visit over the weekend 

If it’s good, will close the deal with the agent before I leave for Davos Switzerland on the 11th of Jan, so that we can have a playground to experiment with for @120363045796860099@g.us

[1/4/24, 5:57:37 AM] Suheil - Europe: btw when are you arriving to davos? what are your plans for europe trip , how long you are staying in the area ?
[5/22/24, 5:23:50 PM] Alessandro Mele: Gary we now know so clearly how much we love you
[1/4/24, 10:43:51 AM] Gary Teh: God knows how long 🤣

Arriving on the 12th evening in Zurich
[5/22/24, 5:24:08 PM] Iwona Fluda: Great to see you back @14153000019. Don’t do it again. I will personally come and kick your ass.
[1/4/24, 10:45:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: ok perfect anyways i have a trip to geneve on week of 17th so by then god knows what we can correlates together 🤣🤣🤣

[1/5/24, 4:20:42 AM] Gary Teh: Establishing another distribution channel

My sense is simply lace as many sales and marketing channels as possible on to this and see where the conversion rate actually happens
[5/22/24, 5:40:14 PM] Gary Teh: Oh..  sorry

I didn’t realize they had totally zero Internet there until I finally parked and started helping setup the fair as a volunteer 🤦‍♂️

But seems like I have been invited to a whole bunch of other festivals like these in the pacific north west for the rest of the season 

Great place to promote our cacao 

People loved it for the following reasons 

- the taste from the way the medicine of the heart was prepared was spectacular 

- ⁠the story of being able to perform a simple act to help restore our rainforest was absolutely empowering to these folks most of whom have never stepped outside of the country before 

- ⁠the price point was a no brainer 

We have a winning product. We just need to monitor customer retention to see if this acquisition method via festivals can scale 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

The book: Activate Your Life, Vol. 4 for which I wrote a chapter, 'Creative Bites: The Dance of Ideas, Sky, and Trust,' along with other authors, has just hit the bestseller lists on Amazon. Still just today you can download the kindle version of this book and 3 previous volumes for free. 🌟

then I guess…I can proudly say… in your face @14153000019 … even without you we were able to engage on a most efficient level that we were able to retrieve you before even you got the time to get back online and reply here ;)

[1/6/24, 1:05:51 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we have established market price for our (_freely available_) clay supply, this becomes really interesting 🤔🤩

We could technically start backing our governance tokens with clay which technically has an indefinite storage period compared to organic materials like cacao and we technically don’t even need to worry about people stealing our clay since there are tons of those where those came from. 🤩

Also since the whole site is full of trash, no one will every want to develope the land for commercial purposes because government ordinance  require that they spend millions of dollars cleaning up the trash (_accumulated over 50 years 🤯_) before they are even allowed to ever build anything on it..  😱

Everytime we sell this freely available commodity on Amazon or to one of our distributors our fiat deposit increases. And our supply is technically protected by the U.S. government 🤔🤣

There is usually 4X more people in that one versus the one in spring which was what I just attended. 

My assumption is that the bales of hay will end up 4X higher in fall…

[1/8/24, 12:39:19 PM] Iwona Fluda: Hi everyone! I've established several media partnerships with organizations during the Davos week, including with the Climate Hub: https://creativeswitzerland.com/climate-hub-davos-x-creative-switzerland/. If you're interested in being featured across our diverse media channels and gaining access to an international audience, please feel free to reach out. This is a unique opportunity to showcase your organization and initiatives and connect with a global network. Looking forward to potentially collaborating with you! Cheers & see you in Davos!

P.S. For one of the events, I also created digital art pieces to be visible on their screen, if you would like to discover more about it and consider it for your events, have a look here: https://creativeswitzerland.com/creative-bites-digital-art-by-iwona-fluda/

@120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs will be shared at Davos

[5/26/24, 6:18:21 PM] Gary Teh: *_Partnership updates*_

The local honey mead (_wine_) producer came up and requested for my contact details

He is seeking chocolate to lace his honey mead with 

There doesn’t seem to be any local chocolatier

The closest chocolatier he can visit is in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon 

As a source he feels it’s very important to be able to taste test it before placing an order of shipment

PS: _*the consumer customer sales activity organically yielding enterprise customer pattern*_ that was exhibited in my parents’ food distribution business back in Singapore is starting to manifest in this project too. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/28/24, 3:32:52 AM] Gary Teh: As adviced by Peter Thiel (_paypal cofounder_), gain a large share of a small market and then scaling strategically.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7ewO1IyZun/?igsh=MXNjdWNqM2sxaHM4ag== 

Competition has been non-existent and if they did exist, our offering is sufficiently differentiated at these small scale regional barter faires up here in the Pacific Northwest. 

From my perspective, it is strategic to fully saturate this distribution and establish a firm foothold before we start expanding to the next distribution channels.

Part of this process will be identifying and recruiting the lieutenants to secure and continue operating these areas before I shift my attention to the next adjacent distribution channel

This is where having an Multilevel marketing model in place comes in handy ‎<This message was edited>

[5/28/24, 5:39:25 PM] Gary Teh: There seems to be a tribune of elders amongst the nomad community that regularly communicate amongst themselves where they collectively maintain a black list of people that should be kept out of the network. 

The reverse seem to be also the case where elders in the community will take notice of an outsider when an elder vouches for him or her. These unnamed elders will at their own time and pace come interact with the outsider and come to their own judgement.

As more and more elders in the network vouch for this outsider, he/she gains status/reputation within the network. The by-product is invitation to access network facilities that are not usually accessible to outsiders.

Flying out from LA so I’m driving over now from Washington state after dropping off the two bags of cacao nibs to @17755088150in Portland Oregon. 

- set up FDA FSVP  documentation for CIC manufacturing facility so we can start utilizing it our Supply Chain

- ⁠ visit for Fazenda Santa Anna farm to collect more video footages for marketing purposes

- ⁠ visit second organic farm to collect video footages for marketing purposes that President of Coopercabruca will bring me to 

- ⁠ set up FDA FSVP documentation for the second farm

- ⁠ open up online bank account in Brazil. This should help save on banking transaction fees.

- ⁠ visit Kraft pouch supplier sourced by @554792591729 to figure out how to link up the Supply Chain with the Cacao nibs manufacturing facility 

- ⁠ visit second farming corporative sourced by @554792591729 to build relationship as well as to set up initial FDA FSVP documentation ‎<This message was edited>

And then bring another batch for sale in the desert in Quartzsite, Arizona during winter season

Dropped pin

All his really expensive equipment has been ransacked 

Saving grace is the solar oven is still intact though 

So is the container. Need to put in a new lock though

The plants are dead. The fishes are gone ‎<This message was edited>

[5/31/24, 10:23:05 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the best way to rapidly gain reputation and support within the nomadic network in the Pacific Northwest is to bring a ton of food to each campfire I visit and then cook and serve it

our hunter gathering forefathers had to hunt to acquire food while our modern day humans have to work a 9-5 to acquire food. 

The most efficient hack I have discovered so far is to go hunter gathering at local food banks for weeks worth of supplies and then unloaded them at every camp I visit. 

This is my most recent hunter gathering hack if anyone is curious🤩🙏

But it does feel like there is room for utilizing AI to make enterprise software to become less clunky and allow humans to become more humane at the work place

[1/10/24, 9:28:41 PM] Gary Teh: All men die. But most never lived 

This dude elevated his relatively short life span from mediocrity to an art form that has inspired a generation of *_Hobos, Hippies and Hoodlums*_ (in the words of @971585558688 🤣). 

He had a beautiful climatic end to his existence. 🤩
[6/1/24, 4:00:29 AM] Gary Teh: These past few weeks while sitting around doing nothing offline, I have been mulling this one question.

The question was posed to me by a fellow hacker at the HackerDojo down in Mountain View, Silicon Valley last year. while me and @16468233438 were serving out samples of our cacao drink

*_How do you measure biodiversity in an ecosystem and ensure that the cabruca system actually helps with biodiversity?*_

A few months ago I did manage to find a lot of mathematical formulas to measure biodiversity in an ecosystem. The most common one is the *_Shannon diversity index*_.

https://www.statology.org/shannon-diversity-index/ 

The math is easy, the main challenge lies in gathering the data and compiling the biodiversity index of a farm. 

Farmers are busy. And it’s comes across as additional work for what would be considered marketing purposes from their perspective

Working through the statistics and thinking through the available technology that is out there, seems the least effortful way to implement the measurement of this would be to use a drone mounted with a high resolution camera 

The video from the drone would be piped to an AI model that then identifies and quantifies all the different species of plants and animals surfaced in the video stream

And if we flew the drone in a fixed pattern across the farm from _east to west, north to south_ we should end up with a 80% accurate count of the different species in the environment 

If this same methodology is applied on all the farms we survey, we will end up with a good enough tabulation overtime. 

We can then justify why we decided to support one farm and not another farm.

And each farm in our support network will come associated with a Shannon index 

And people who buy our bags of cacao nibs could then scan the associated QR code and very quickly see the statistics of the farm the cacao is from. 

If we want ensure the records against being tempered, we could write the records on the blockchain signed with our key

That is how I would see AI and blockchain being implemented at the farm level ‎<This message was edited>

[6/3/24, 3:01:59 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes yesterday discussing with Heather and Mycal who are based in Portland. They run a bar in Chinatown 

They seem keen to import Coconut water

Might spend sometime to source for it when in Brazil 

Noticed that Whole Foods in Rochester  New York is now selling each for $4.99

_PS: Heather mentioned she would be open sourcing for investors on her side to finance the importing of the coconut water once I figured out the sourcing_

_will be joining their crew for the Guignol horror film festival in September again later this year_

_Julia who organizes the Guignol horror film festival in Portland Oregon with Dylan did mentioned that if I ever publish a documentary, she and Dylan would be very happy to screen it when they go on their Hollywood indie film circuit._

_Will capture footage on the state of the rainforest in Brazil during my upcoming visit to compile one such documentary for @120363044028036610@g.us and tap on their network_ ‎<This message was edited>

Spent 2 hours having lunch with Stanley to discuss about @120363044028036610@g.us

*_Outcomes*_
- granted access to use the San Francisco state university innovation labs facility whenever I am in town 

*_Next steps*_

- draft up the scope for inspiration leadership program which he will then surface to the professors for discussion 

- ⁠expected outcome is we will mentor selected students to build out specific aspects of @120363044028036610@g.us and TrueSight DAO

- ⁠scope 1: implementation of Shannon Biodiversity index via smart contracts on the blockchain for farms

- ⁠scope 2: extension of smart contract records by freighting companies and community warehouse managers

- ⁠scope 3: extend smart contracts for ratification by independent third party (_universities, churches, government_)

- ⁠scope 4: for voluntary contributions done by community members to move DAO project forward, mint them as as ledger entry in the blockchain in exchange for governance tokens

- ⁠will review what Stanley’s team has built so far to see what we could use for scope 1 through 4 the week after

Self (1) + Divinity, aka choiceless awareness (1) = 2 

To get to 1 one of the two must be removed from the equation 

Not-self, aka Anatta (0) + Divinity, choiceless awareness (1) = 1

When anybody is doing anything make sure Nobody is Doing Nothing

- validate that we could import 100KG, figure out the logistics via airfreight and clear USA border customs with no issues
- ⁠validate we can identify repeatable sales channels where we could distribute our cacao nibs
- ⁠validate that end consumers resonate with our brand story

_Outcome_
- We were successful on all 3 counts



*_Goal of AGL3 contract_*

- validate that we could import 500KG, figure out the logistics via sea freight and clear customs with no issues

- ⁠⁠validate we can scale existing repeatable sales channels and identify more sales channels where we could distribute all 500kg of our cacao nibs successfully

- determine the maximum volume of cacao nibs that could be absorbed via vanlife-like/nomadic activities in the Pacific North west during Spring, Summer and Autumn period as well as in the desert region during the Winter season.

- ⁠determine that we are able to sell successfully to chocolatiers via Cold marketing outreach.

- ⁠determine that there is indeed demand for 100% cacao ceremonial bars

- ⁠figure out logistics for canning and selling chocolate drinks for sales

[1/19/24, 7:01:25 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 the day before at the Free Thinker Society where he and I shared about the concerns of the forthcoming @120363044542957540@g.us 

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

We spent 2 hours at the free thinker’s society 

_PS: @41799155602 observed the ripple effect on the dropping of this bomb. Economists independently brought this up during discussions at various panels they are part of_

[6/12/24, 5:22:01 PM] Gary Teh: Finished preparing contract for upcoming  @120363044028036610@g.us AGL3 

Made a bunch of enhancements to the clauses therein based on learnings from AGL2 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdFtZ8YoGMsE0RdQ4hGFINUO8CORap7smzbmQXy4Dj4/edit

Also, DAO will be charging fees of 22% instead of 19% for helping manage the sales and marketing of the inbound shipment 

This increase is justified by the fact that during AGL2, DAO has figured out a repeatable sales and marketing channel 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdFtZ8YoGMsE0RdQ4hGFINUO8CORap7smzbmQXy4Dj4/edit

_PS: my sense is as distribution channel scales and sales volume continues to increase to the level where we can absorb more and more of the production capacity of the regenerative farms we are serving, investment return multiples for AGL contract investors will gradually tend towards multi of the federal reserve risk free interest rate yield._

_Junk bonds (unsecured loans) and MREITs (mortgage backed real estate investment trust) in USA are returning around 12% per annum at the moment._

[1/19/24, 12:11:16 PM] Gary Teh: *_Observations made while aimlessly drifting through Davos_*:

Unacquainted strangers who made initial contact when presented with the same story (_stimulus_) either respond one way or the other 

- less and less excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠more and more excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠folks involved in the crypto space visibly recoil as though just presented with a venomous snake after being presented with the keyword _DAO_ if and when they decide to pry further beyond the _Do Nothing_ stage of the story 

_Story_
- I Do Nothing but sometimes when the Calling to do so comes I contribute to projects managed and operated by a DAO

_Distinctive demographic differences_

- subjects who become less and less excited tend to be dressed in formal suits 

- ⁠subjects who grow more and more excited tend to be dressed in casual wear. Further observed is the more esoteric their garment looks the more rapid the rate by which they get excited

They mentioned they would be happy to make introductions when I arrived along the west coast of Africa where cacao is being cultivated. 

@120363045796860099@g.us has been particularly intriguing amongst friends as it was immediately labeled as an Elon Musk category project. 

these were the general themes surfaced during discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

_Key insights_

- it is possible to have *Integrity* (_core value_) without need for Transparency (_not core value_)

_Follow up action_

- future useful insights gathered that are not tokenizable will no longer be shared within these channels (_DM me if you are keen to find out where the category of untokenized  insights are published and shared_)

- ⁠this will further reduce the amount of post within our WhatsApp channels 

- ⁠if two or more DAO members are present, visual submissions will no longer be a requirement to prove that DAO contribution has transpired

[1/22/24, 1:55:02 PM] Gary Teh: *discussion for the week*

what are your thoughts on the China wobbling economy on activities within our DAO? ‎<This message was edited>
[6/13/24, 3:26:29 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, we will be having a cacao circle this evening at Block71 during the NUS INNOVATION FORUM (SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA)

https://www.gevme.com/nus-innovation-forum-san-francisco-bay-area-23993705

See you all there if you have already registered for the event

[1/22/24, 2:01:49 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Very interesting question, I’m eager to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from people in that part of the world. Not an expert on Chinese economics. I only come across so much made in China stuff as i am sure you all do. Do we need all that? 🤔
‎[6/14/24, 3:05:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[1/23/24, 8:14:47 AM] Alessandro Mele: Indeed really interesting question. I guess it depends on our exposure to the Chinese economy : do we have any members living there who might be affected? How do they see the situation and it’s impact on their lives? And do we have any partner or supply chain exposure there? There might be repercussions on the cost of supplies for instance or a reduction in sales from clients in the region. The fact that our DAO is a fairly small and agile organisation should make us resilient and flexible to adapt to chancing macroeconomic situations.
‎[6/14/24, 3:05:39 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[1/23/24, 10:13:07 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Indeed. Looking at it from a macro perspective and how the majority of synthetic/petrochemicals products/by products come from China, the supply chain aspect will be affected. China could end up raising prices, to fill up the coffers. Leaving room for the cradle to cradle circular economy aspect to gain traction @41765737357 is an expert in c2c field. Very strong in the recycled packaging field. Might be interesting to explore partners in China who will adopt these practices… 

And of course when you throw the US in there as their best econ partner we could partially predict what’s going to come as long as we stay on the sustainability agenda. Let’s see what happens. It’s an election year across majority of the countries.

- child labor
- ⁠deforestation 

The chocolate manufacturing industry is going through this news cycle of extremely bad PR at the moment

Not sure how long it’s going to last but feels like we caught this wave at just the right time and we are coasting along at the moment.

There are a few folks who have asked how they could contribute. I referred them to our DAO website

[6/14/24, 12:01:10 PM] Gary Teh: Worldwide Supply shortage of cacao is set to persist this year. 

When I spoke with Natalia from the cooperative in Altamira, she mentioned the supplies from a lot of the farms in that cooperative have already been pre-sold 

Ivory Coast has banned all exports while Ghana is delaying delivery

[6/14/24, 3:40:41 PM] Gary Teh: @447507059473 please check with your team to verify that LATOKENs has received USDT1000 as downpayment for listing fees

This is the transaction hash.
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x69fb7c1ef2ce732cb118bf9e93aeab72aacd868a07c5f942d9c1c9f8d0a2ca84

Once your team confirms that the amount has been received on their end at this wallet address, I will proceed to transfer the rest.
[1/24/24, 2:13:37 PM] Gary Teh: @14152023011 could you share the performance of your automated crypto-currency trading strategy since  its inception 

Please list the following
- sharpe ratio
- ⁠largest drawdown
- ⁠time to recovery since largest drawdown 
- ⁠period in months fund has been running

Post LATOKENs listing in the very short run, we might end up having more liquidity that we could deploy for project build up purposes. It might make sense to deploy a small portion of the liquidity to be managed by your bot if the 4 parameters being inspected are up to par with our DAO’s requirements 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Thereafter we spent the rest of the evening at the theatre cafe having a deeply meaningless discussion on what it means to be part of the @120363044542957540@g.us 🤩🤣
[6/14/24, 3:45:25 PM] Gary Teh: Time taken to undertake transaction was 2.5 hours. 

*_Tasks includes_*

- Setting up a proxy server in Singapore and then SSL tunneling to the internet via that Proxy server to by-pass restrictions most exchanges have placed on visitors via USA IP address

- ⁠Researching cross-chain bridges that doesn’t require the KYC process

_PS: Seems the ecosystem is becoming more restricted compared to the last time we did a USDT vault withdrawal. Gate.IO the usual bridge I use does allow deposits from Singaporeans or Americans._

Didn’t realized one of our DAO members (_Aihui_) was going to be on the panel this evening 

She was giving a lot of advice on FDA related matters (_from her previous startup experience_) last year when we were still attempting to figure out the legal side of things 

Getting her help next to get introduced to food engineer she has previously worked with that is based here 

Time taken 15 minutes
[1/25/24, 5:00:30 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Insightful. Considering the QE in China maybe we can prompt Edgar and Getdata to observe the polarities and trends in reporting so we can base more qualitative decisions in our dealings: trading, commerce, research, etc… anyone has any suggestions?

He mentioned his already working with quite a few procurement managers working for manufacturers

The proposed next step is for him to talk to the procurement managers to get a tabulated list of the kind of materials they are looking for 

We are on our side will handle the FDA clearance of all materials to feed into his system inventory as well as compliance off suppliers while he on his side will just focus on acquiring procurement managers for his inventory system

[6/18/24, 3:57:27 PM] Gary Teh: Spent two hours this morning undertaking the following tasks as guild master of @120363044028036610@g.us 

- Follow up with the corporative in Altamira, Para to make arrangements for my visit

- ⁠following up with @31641075825 and @972543523823 for the new package design which incorporates feedback from the Cacao Circles we’ve conducted the past few weeks (_courtesy of @14152032783and @6598622082_)

- ⁠ poking @16468233438 to get the calling script done which will then be reassigned to Suchitra to execute on 

- ⁠ poking @16468233438 to get the details we need to ship out the 500 KG shipment from Ilheus to USA via Sea freight.

- ⁠ corresponding with Alice on buyer feedback from ShenZhen china
[1/28/24, 9:16:16 AM] Minahil Alvi: The challenge actually starts with the teachers - In the Middle East specifically the average teacher spends 20 to 30 percent of their daily classroom time doing admin tasks such as (Lesson planning, student reports, Subject specific materials, etc) Tutorwith.ai automates these tasks leaving room for a more personalized educational experience. We are in the MVP stage of our platform and until now the feedback from teachers and educators has been overwhelmingly positive, indicating the importance of our mission and vision. (In short, the challenge we are anticipating might be on the adoption side of such a tool in the wider educational landscape)
[6/18/24, 4:12:14 PM] Gary Teh: *_Reflections on the qualitative data received so far*_

*_Manufacturers*_ that utilize our raw material for their own final product, really only care about availability of supplies and price. if we go down this route, we will just end up haggling over price and margins with the buyer and the farmers. It will only further compound the inertia in the industry that is right now causing all these social and environmental problems, the source of all this negative PR in the industry right now.


When that the price of the end product matches with existing brands out there, *_USA Consumers*_ are very sensitive to the narrative/brand story. And will be very inclined to switch. All thanks to the 2020 pandemic and the increasing concerns about climate change... every new report of nature disasters that are attributed to climate change only serves to galvanize more support for the @120363044028036610@g.us brand story 

In light of this key piece of insight, the Tesla approach of owning the entire supply Chain vertical till the stage of consumer sales, bypassing, all traditional middle men, makes a lot of sense. ‎<This message was edited>

[6/19/24, 11:09:45 AM] Gary Teh: Finally got around to thinking through why TDG tokens would be interesting for *_professional investors/speculators*_ now that our governance tokens are on the way to getting listed on LATOKENS exchange 

*_Simple high level calculation based on just @120363044028036610@g.us business model*_

- Estimated market size of 1% of the US chocolate market: $195 million

- Estimated market capitalization of the future company at 1% market penetration level (using an average P/S ratio of 2): $390 million

- Current valuation of DAO (based on total tokens issued at 1 TDG = 1 USD): $1.9 million

- Expected return on capital returns at 1% market penetration: *_205x*_ ($390 million ÷ $1.9 million = 205)

_Spent around 30 minutes working through the mathematics and the high level projections with the aid of chatgpt in pulling out and tabulating the numbers._

_Did not include high level projections for other geographical territories that we could expand into or products other than cacao derivatives_

_To get to target 1% market penetration, we need to source for a few more talents, namely_

- seasoned FMCG marketeer

- ⁠seasoned international logistics and freighting professional 

- ⁠seasoned food engineer ‎<This message was edited>

[6/19/24, 11:27:20 AM] Gary Teh: Have proposed initial listing price of our governance token to be at the amount of USD in our vault backing each issued TDG token 

Will leave it to the traders on the LATOKENs exchange to decide how they want to price the tokens, namely the following approach 

- cash per token

- ⁠contribution per token

- ⁠some multiple of our historic revenue 

- ⁠some speculative value based on what has been realized so far by our execution using their own Growth model projections

The contribution list will vary from project to project.
[6/19/24, 11:51:57 AM] Gary Teh: Based on governance tokens management protocol voted into effect 15th Nov 2023 in our TownHall

- Rule 3: if trading price falls below cash per token, DAO will proceed to do buy back

- Rule 4: If trading price goes above USDT1, DAO will proceed to make sale till the maximum extend of increasing total TDG tokens in circulation by additional 25% of what was already in circulation at the end of the previous quarter.

[1/31/24, 2:34:07 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: sure, The IEO or initial exchange offering is a way to offer the token to early investors/traders. It is similar to a presale or ICO but it is done on the exchange.The price during the ICO is usually at a discount to the public sale price to reward early participants.It also allows projects to raise funds by selling a % of the token supply. It must be noted however that the exchange can't guarantee of how much funds may be raised.It is also used to market promote and create awareness of the project. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/31/24, 2:36:24 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The listing going live on the other hand would be setting up a trading pair on the exchange and make trading on the exchange possible right away.The listing will also include promotional campaigns to drive token adoption and community growth.

[1/31/24, 3:26:39 PM] Gary Teh: Based on the policy voted into effect, we are just planning to release 200,000 TDG for sale this IEO and listing 

All DAO members are already contributing at 1USD = 1TDG

What are your thoughts if we just made the token price at IEO to be the same rate and then thereafter allow market to decide what rate they want the prevailing TDG/USDT exchange rate to be at? ‎<This message was edited>
‎[6/20/24, 4:27:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‎video omitted
[1/31/24, 3:38:49 PM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The market will eventually decide the rate, but there has to a price for the initial listing to have a starting point. After the first initial trades the price will be determined by market sentiment. I think a better way to do it is set whatever price you want the listing to be and have the IEO be at a discounted price, So an example could be to set the listing price at 1USD per TDG. Prior to the listing IEO participants can be given the chance to by at $0.80/TDG. Have a cap on the IEO say 75% of allocated tokens.The remaining tokens can be used for co-marketing activities and the liquidity for the trading pair. The trading pair can be opened with as little as $250TDG/$250USDT but the more liquidity the lower the less volatile the price will be and have better spreads on the buys/asks
‎[6/20/24, 4:35:58 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[1/31/24, 3:44:14 PM] Gary Teh: I see

It might make sense to do the following

Pricing
- IEO at $1/TDG 
- ⁠list at $1.5/TDG 

Allocation volume 
- 150,000TDG for allocated IEO
- 50,000TDG allocated for release during listing time 

Anyone else have thoughts about this?

After an hour of back-and-forth, finally I got the issue approved by the federal taxation office

Singapore is spelt with a C in Portuguese Cingapura which got them confused as they couldn’t find record of the country in the database 🤔

Stage three will be to open a digital bank account here in Brazil 

Ideally, the bank has an API (_application programming interface_) so that we can hook the bank up for easy off chain off of TDG from our DAO or USDT from our @120363044028036610@g.us AGL smart contracts to Brazilian Reis in the future 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[6/26/24, 2:26:44 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 has spent 30 minutes helping make introduction to the politician that represents the indigenous here in the Amazon

The goal is to help us more deeply understand the challenges the indigenous population experience here in the Amazon ‎<This message was edited>
[2/2/24, 8:44:48 PM] Gary Teh: As previously shared during Davos at the Hari Krishna temple, when I last did the math, 20ft container worth of mushroom basically yields around USD2 million every 3 months. If distributing wholesale, it’s around USd1 million every 3 months per 20ft container

We don’t really need much upfront investment. Just need to get a plot of land to setup the initial prototype 

Snowballing of the revenue from that will help scale the infrastructure. It’s basically another marketing and distribution problem ‎<This message was edited>

[2/2/24, 10:22:07 PM] Gary Teh: After a chat with @16468233438, seems most likely for the rest of the year I might end up knocking on the door of  USA chocolatiers in areas which have recently gotten their asses kicked by Mother Nature to do some proselytizing of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs 

This means very likely I will be visiting San Diego after the 1000 year flood subsides 😵🙃

[2/3/24, 1:42:22 PM] Gary Teh: @447507059473 you might want to adjust this term before you get into trouble with your boss

The second USDT3000 is contingent on IEO raising more than that amount otherwise, there is no recourse on you receiving that amount from the DAO since all the DAO members will just become permanent residents in the @120363044542957540@g.us beyond that point and really Do Nothing 🙂🙏

A more feasible term would be up to USDt3000 contingent on the USDt amount being raised during IEO and the balance in TDG. ‎<This message was edited>

- ⁠RnD in the San Francisco kitchen on how to coat the cacao almonds with caramel and then sell that as its final product 

- ⁠this approach will ensures that each region has its own unique product that best represents it

Do you want the entire life cycle from harvest, that is, the nuts in the shell, deshelled and vacuumed? Also, on the local certifications, we are making good progress. We are looking to finalize before April.

[6/27/24, 8:55:40 PM] Gary Teh: Just occurred to me, since I am here I might as well take the opportunity to experiment and find out what happens when a bar of artisanal chocolate is dropped in the mail box of the local postal office and shipped to @16468233438 place in USA 🤔

@14806488258 did suggest experimenting with international mailing of small packages when we last had lunch a few months ago.
[2/4/24, 2:57:06 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s get some over to Switzerland as well.

[2/4/24, 3:06:59 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Will do!
[6/28/24, 3:53:28 AM] Gary Teh: And then it occurred to me the Kraft pouch might be the perfect envelope to ship the chocolates in 🤩

- exterior is tough enough to withstand wear and tear

- ⁠it is possible to easily write or simply stick an address label on it

- ⁠interior is water proof  and airtight when heat sealed so not a big issue even if the chocolate melts

- ⁠the aluminum lining also provides some structural reinforcement to prevent the interior content from being too damaged

[6/29/24, 12:04:00 AM] Gary Teh: Spent four hours wining and dining over at Paulo’s family house with his dad who is a senior official of CEPLAC 

- The key takeaways are the total production volume of Organic cacao is 1200 tons a year

- ⁠ only 10% of these supplies are properly fermented with at least 80% fermentation level

- ⁠ the fermentation of the other 90% of the supplies is inconsistent  hence lots of them are just sold bulk price 

- ⁠ he proposed to set up a separate fermentation facility to handle fermentation to increase the total supply of well to be above 10% of the organic cacao supply by 3X

- ⁠ makes total sense why the markup for organic cacao versus bulk price in this region is around 20% as opposed to 100%

- ⁠ totally explains why Natalia emphasized this during our conversation two weeks ago

- ⁠ also explains why the directors of the corporative yesterday was asking how many percent fermentation in the cacao we are seeking in our sourcing

- ⁠ finally explains the anomaly in the Organico pricing that I observed when @554792591729 first surfaced the pricing from this region to me earlier this year

- ⁠ my response to him at the zero to one stage. We just want to make sure the Supply Chain works. We are just going to test a small shipment.

- ⁠ in later iterations, we will start optimizing the supply chain as what we are doing right now in Bahia ‎<This message was edited>

It has since been expanded to a lot of other countries. The solution might be to find some country nearby that has the UPU epacket agreement with the US, bulk ship cacao to that country, and then take advantage of shipping rates from that country to the US. 

Or bulk ship cacao to the US and then do retail shipping to customers from a US address using bulk mail shipping rates.
[2/6/24, 10:12:16 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 since you are looking into reconfiguring the freighting portion of Agroverse into USA from Brazil check with @918017107841 too

[6/29/24, 7:09:09 AM] Gary Teh: Insights from last evening

starting to understand why I couldn’t find any cooperatives in the Amazonas state that grows organic cacao

They don’t grow it there , the indigenous just goes into the jungle to harvest the wild Cacao that’s growing there

The center of activity is the town of Tabathinga which I traversed through last year during my border crossing from Brazil into Columbia

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C80lzSstCMX/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Last year, when I was just starting to dabble into this space, I mentioned to folks around me that the Cacao don’t really taste different from one region to another

At Cacao Innovation Center I was offered samples of three different chocolate made using the same exact recipe… 70% cacao

They tasted absolutely different  🤯
[2/6/24, 8:50:03 PM] Gary Teh: What synchronicity!?! 🤩

Was chatting with a close friend based in Shanghai to get a sense of how bad the economy in China was just now so as to figure how much of the dirt cheap assets to be considered for collection as the country goes into shit 💩😱

Didn’t realize she recently got into regenerative energy sector as well 

She has proposed to take the entire round of financing needs for @120363045796860099@g.us… as usual, she complained the required capital outlay is peanuts!?! 🤷‍♂️🤣

She even proposed to supply  second hand solar panels for sale in USA if interested via our @120363044028036610@g.us Amazon account  🤩

[6/30/24, 1:21:52 PM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the Sunday*

- The final three hours yesterday evening was the most critical qualitative observation during this entire week since arriving in Altamira.

- Jedie pulled over on the highway while on our way back to Altamira when he saw a fellow organizer of the event had a flat tire. It was in the middle of nowhere where there was zero cell phone reception.

- He first tried to help change the tire using his own tools but quickly realize the nuts were a different size.

- He drove for 20 minutes to the nearby farm attempting to get help but realized the farm was closed.

- He drove for 30 minutes to a nearby restaurant attempting to get help.

- He managed to finally arrange for help to come.

- He drove back to the organizer’s truck to explain the help he has setup

- He brought loaded passenger on the other truck over to our truck to bring the passenger back to Altamira while help came

*Constrains he experienced during the entire situation*

- It’s been a long day, we were all physically tired especially since he went to bed pretty late the night before as well

- ⁠the sun has set. Road conditions were bad and it was pouring heavily

- ⁠The gear box of our truck was already on the verge of failing. He was praying for the gear box to continue holding before our drive back to Altamira

*Personal interpretation*

- If Jedie had a weaker character he could have just ignored the fellow participant who was experiencing trouble and continued going about his business.

- I always believe you can’t change a person’s character, but instead you could do is to be very diligent when selecting professional partners based on desirable character trait that they already exhibit when undertaking minor things.

- ⁠My interpretation from this, when issued a request, Jedie will to the utmost of his abilities deliver on the requirements. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/7/24, 2:56:03 PM] Gary Teh: Greetings. I have been involved with a DAO based organisation called United Religions Initiative since 2008 and it was founded in 2000. For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this. It is the Proof of Point of DAO which is now 24 years old
‎[7/1/24, 10:51:36 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/7/24, 2:56:03 PM] Gary Teh: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

It has a flavour profile that is very distinct from the one we have from Bahia

While the one from Bahia is very well balanced and aromatic 

This one is very floral and fruity. It is perfect for the cacao almond snacks

It’s grown on former pasture (_deforested_) land that has since been restored by the family living on it ‎<This message was edited>

[7/2/24, 10:19:17 PM] Gary Teh: Similar with Bahia, the earliest time they can start shipping will be in August. The impact of climate change is deeply felt across the board. 

Till now their warehouse is mostly empty and devoid of inventory, even though it is usually the case that harvest generally starts in May and inventory becomes available late May.
[2/9/24, 1:14:18 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 5 minutes modifying the phrase on our landing page from ~empower change~ to _Heal the world with love_

Empowering change is very abstract. Doesn’t address what is the change we are trying to make as well as the motivation to do so. 🤔
[7/2/24, 11:32:11 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 2 hours thinking through the qualitative data collected from the folks in the Bahia and Para community

the prevailing norm is for dominant chocolate manufacturers (_majority European based_) to import cacao from these communities, perform the manufacturing in Europe before redistributing the end products to the consumers, in the process capturing the bulk of the profit margin for themselves.

Analysis with the help of Meta AI shows that USA is in fact the world’s largest market for chocolate consumption. 

Shifting manufacturing away from Europe to the source countries and then importing the manufactured end product directly into USA if done properly will yield structural cost savings that will be hard for European manufacturers to compete against in the USA market (_we don’t incur logistic cost associated with having a European leg in our supply chain_). 

From my limited understanding, since there is a lot of labor union protection in these European, shifting their manufacturing to source countries for these companies is like pulling teeth. It will also generate very very bad PR for them domestically. But since we have zero legacy, we dont have this problem.

From this perspective, the *disruptive innovation/ differentiation is the structure of the supply chain itself*

- Importing directly into the USA, _the world's largest market_, from source countries
- Direct sourcing from small scale farming to support regenerative farming practices in the Amazon rainforest
- ⁠Stimulating local industry growth to eventually displace the dominant chocolate manufacturers
- Reducing carbon footprint by eliminating the European leg of the supply chain
- offer USA consumers high quality cacao as opposed to low quality cacao at the same prevailing price

The *final outcome*
- Environment: reduced carbon footprint and support for regenerative farming
- Consumers: high-quality cacao at a competitive price
- Local communities: economic growth and empowerment ‎<This message was edited>

_Discussed_
- Green Up is a non-profit Swiss association
- ⁠Explored how Green Up operates projects and events in Switzerland
- ⁠One of the most popular workshop offered by Green Up to cooperations is how to live simply
- ⁠how foundations that provide financing to Green Up projects work

potential areas for interfacing
- Green Up has done a bunch of research on living simply and soil restoration. We could potentially utilize the research materials to identify prototypes we want to test and implement for testing in the SunMint Project. Those that we have tested to work in our SunMint project we can then compile as a handbook that Green Up could use in their workshops
- We could learn from operating processes that Green Up follows when running volunteer based events
- ⁠There has been a bunch of folks in our DAO that have proposed that I write a book at some point. I think the most useful book I could probably come up with right now is basically a blueprint that people can follow to implement the minimal carbon footprint off-grid setup I have right now. I will contribute that as materials to the workshop that Green Up workshop
- ⁠Foundations that Green Up is in communications with in Switzerland that are associated retailing distribution would be helpful for distributing Agroverse produce growing using environmentally restorative techniques. We should support the farmers ‎<This message was edited>

[7/5/24, 1:40:38 PM] Gary Teh: _PS: Barking up the wrong tree by hoping to get resource challenged farmers to pay for technology solutions was a lesson I learned when working on platform growth and monetization back in Edmodo_

_Teachers in the USA are the most abused lot in the country. When I was making initial visits to classroom in the USA while conducting interviews and making actual on the ground observations, first thing I noticed is that they are really really broke and always under-resourced. And often left very streased_ 

_USA public schools are underfunded. Meanwhile parents having paid a lot of money to moving to expensive for real estate within reputable school district expect schools to handle the rest when it comes to their children’s education without forking out more resources on their end_

_it’s a vicious catch 22 making education a very challenging vertical_

_in hindsight, it was really good training Dojo as a technologist since you are trained from day one to know how to deliver quality that work with limited resources… aka being very *LEAN*._

_this operating philosophy helps one go a very long way in any industrial vertical one attempts to penetrate especially in the pre-product-market-fit stages_ ‎<This message was edited>

- current go to market strategy is still too spotty and lack enough consistency to scale 

- shadowing/replication the distribution network of specific health food store that is in close proximity to the yoga studios/gym that was observed in Palo Alto 

- ⁠focus on smaller regional retail networks that are focused on our target audience segment. Example ranch99 established their network in areas with a high concentration of Chinese.

- state to consumer on package that each N KG of chocolate sold, 1 cacao tree is planted on pasture land in the Amazon that is to be restored
- ⁠each cacao nibs package should have its unique serial number that could be traced to the location of specific tree planted 
- ⁠for each new cacao tree planted, corresponding carbon credit issued via recognized authority in Brazil 
- ⁠USA is number 1 emitter of carbon. Credits could be sold to companies with a net carbon negative balance

It states if a piece of land has 80% of forestation or less, no trees can be cut down. 

If a land has more than 80% forestation up to 20% of the land could be cleared 

For legacy land that has below 80% Forestation, if the land was left fallow and New trees start to grow on it, land owners by law are not allowed to cut down any of the trees Forestation level is above 80%

Putting those wind mills behind trees is the stupidest idea after direct CO2 capture from air ever proposed by the folks making money in dirty waters of climate-industrial complex because trees decelerate wind flow, and therefore reduce their profits. 😅

- ⁠he is planning to work on publishing a book on education for kids on how to Do Nothing (_with computers_) now that addiction level is almost hitting epidemic level as well as how to live simply. I have proposed the RND that we are conducting via @120363045796860099@g.us be forwarded over to him to include in the book. Once it’s published, the book could be forwarded over to @41786813052 

- ⁠he mentioned USA used to be setup as networks of trading post where the European civilization gradually expanded westwards. @120363045796860099@g.us cluster that @19209806391 shared could be a modern rendition of this network

- ⁠Evangelizing an intentional day of Do Nothing as a movement! This we will more deeply explore in the @120363044542957540@g.us 🤩🙏

Pollution of air, soil and aquifer with microplastics eroded from wind turbine blades may affect the quality of agricultural produce in neighbouring areas. Using fraudulently declared "clean, green, CO2 free" unsustainable unreliable wind & solar alternative energy systems definitely should be avoided if it is the case within project boundary

[7/8/24, 12:46:16 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/15/24, 10:29:58 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity—facilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.
[7/8/24, 1:18:44 PM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense what you just said

DAO Will review your article and tokenize links that are relevant to @120363044028036610@g.us⁩ Project

60% will have to be paid before the IEO and the remaining 40%a fter the IEO before trading pair goes live.

- custom duty exemption 
- ⁠cheap incorporation cost and year renewal fees
- ⁠liberal legislation on cryptocurrencies

Belize remains the best country incorporate the parent DAO entity that manages the governance tokens still sitting in the vault 

Coincidentally, Dimitra.io the recent company I research also had their company incorporated there 

Next step would be to experiment with shipping a bar of chocolate from Belize to San Francisco to get data on the actual cost of shipping

And then ship a bar of chocolate from Brazil to an address to Belize

That way we can then compare the actual price difference 🤔

Bulk shipping will be tricky to consider at this early stage since sales volume is not that high yet

[7/10/24, 3:10:50 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the agenda of today’s meeting with Karen is to get some visibility of how much carbon credit we will get issued if we financed 100 trees to the indigenous in the Amazonas that @557191035605 introduced

Ideally, the realized sale price of the carbon credit we get for financing the 100 Cacao trees to the indigenous in the Amazonas is more than the actual amount of USD spent acquiring the cacao trees

That way DAO will still have a net surplus after the 100 cacao tree has been financed and shipped to the indigenous folks there

_PS: there is a difference between sustainable sustainability efforts (the funds replenishes itself) and unsustainable philanthropy (giving money away)_ ‎<This message was edited>

*Follow ups*
- Karent to determine if the economics might work for her company to help issue carbon credits in exchange for TDG governance tokens
- ⁠Karen to determine if it is possible to issue at least USD$5 worth of carbon credit per tree planted
- ⁠Karen to define the exact methodology we must follow to get the carbon credit issued for the trees we finance to the indigenous

Target outcome
- $USD500 worth of carbon credit issued for the 100 Cacao trees we will be fiinancing to be planted by the indigenous that @557191035605 introduced.

Each registry has its own Methodology we must follow and set of documentation to get the carbon credit issued 

_PS. Starting to see the some pattern similarities between carbon credit registries and the web servers_

_all of the latter serve web pages but their architecture and interfacing is a little different_

_the main commonality is that HTML documents are served when http requests are received_

_The Apache web server has a different expectation versus the Microsoft IIS server versus the rails engine versus the Python Django engine_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/10/24, 9:24:08 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 1.5 hours facetime with Stanley Li and Mayra

Mayra is one of the student union leaders from the San Francisco state university

*Key takeaways*

- Mayra will bring scope 1 back to the student union and work on organizing an on-campus event as an initial pilot to drive awareness of the current problem into chocolate industry 

- ⁠KPI proposed for adoption by Stanley for event success - 1) Number of new Instagram content supporters and 2) sales volume on agroverse.shop

- ⁠Mayra will look through some of the engineering scope and reach out to students in the engineering faculty to find students who open to contribution

- ⁠Mayra will be working with the student union to help source for government funding to implement the proposed scope.

_PS: Mayra is from Peru. She and her parents are familiar with the issues in the cacao industry._

Have also spoken with organizer to be onboarding van life influencers while we are there for an overriding commission of subsequent sales by influencers they bring onboard (_guess we are going down the MLM route on the direct to consumer side of the business after all_)

[7/11/24, 9:00:05 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes executing 1000TDG transfer to project success team on LATOKEN for TDG promotion purposes on their platform
[2/27/24, 10:19:20 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello good day everyone.

I talked to the approvals team regarding the LATOKEN listing. For a short amount of time I can reduce the final price to 5k from 10 but it would have to be paid in USDT or other equivalent.

The main points are
*Can be listed for 5k total instead of 10k
*Needs to be USD 
*Can pay 3k in advance and 2K after IEO


If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.

- Total debited amount from USA account: $105
- ⁠Total fees charged by TransferWise: $2.20
- ⁠Actual Amount sent: $102.80
- Conversion of $102.80 to $R at prevailing exchange rate on XE.com: R$560.3532 
- ⁠⁠⁠Final amount credited into Brazilian Bank account R$559
- ⁠⁠⁠Final amount equivalent in USD that we received: $102.46592
- Total waiting time for money to be transfered from USA bank account to Brazilian Bank account: 3 minutes
- *⁠⁠⁠USD lost in bank transaction fees: -$2.53408*

*Breakdown of TransferWise Fees*
- ⁠TransferWise charges: $1.52
- ⁠IOF tax: $0.39

Conclusion: we have a winning formula for cheaply transferring USD to Brazil for conversion into R$ 🤩🙏

*Implications with low transaction fees and fast turn around time:*
- Micro-payments for purchases become feasible
- ⁠Retaining of a work force in Brazil becomes feasible

- Discover cryptocurrency brokerage that can allow us to onramp R$ from our Brazilian bank account to exchange for USDT
- ⁠Discover cryptocurrency brokerage that can allow us to offramp USDT as R$ into our Brazilian bank account
- ⁠Once we discover an easy way to do so, we can work on the next part which is to implement Smart contract which Crypto whales could sign to finance AGL contracts directly on the Blockchain

[7/12/24, 3:43:35 PM] Gary Teh: Bumped into Eddy Diamantis, a FullBright scholar, undergoing internship for a U.S. law firm. He is undertaking an assignment for their firm on behalf of some USA govnerment. The goal is to figure out how to further increase USA foreign direct investment as well as near shoring in this region 

*_My interpretation*_

- USA barely has any foreign investment interest in Brazil 

- ⁠BRICS was signed last year and during which time Brazilian President has stated USA relationship is not of much significance compared to China trade relations

- ⁠China’s belt road initiative is really helped China gained lots of influence in this region 

- ⁠the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean have acted as very strategic moat for USA territory

- ⁠a scenario where China gains enough influence in a Latin American country to establish a Chinese naval base would present a headache especially one that is right along the shores of the Caribbean Sea.

- ⁠the Cuban missile was one of those scenarios which presented a lot of headache when it happened 

- ⁠the amount of natural resources Brazil has to back its foreign efforts is a few order of magnitude larger compared to Cuba’s. Hence more holding power if and when it takes roots

- ⁠before USA was dragged into WW2 by Japan, its stance was isolationistic and was primarily only concerned with what was happening in the Americas 

- ⁠USA policy has been tending towards isolationism these past few years 

*_What to watch out for from the US*_

- more concessions for imports from this region into USA 

- ⁠more policies to encourage USA foreign investments in this region 

- ⁠infrastructure improvements as near shoring trend gains momentum 

- ⁠price increase as near shoring trend builds momentum continues

- brazilian and Indian  suppliers for @120363044028036610@g.us. @919210068790 will send price list over 

- ⁠MLM marketing for @120363044028036610@g.us with Neil and his network of influencers 

- ⁠Neil’s conscious product market place back by sources from @120363044028036610@g.us 

- ⁠@919210068790 and Neil’s mental health market place where all spiritualist and mental health practitioners can list their service… related to the Do Nothing society

- ⁠@120363045796860099@g.us Offgrid facility as a venue for @120363044542957540@g.us to unplug and restore their mental health

[7/12/24, 3:44:58 PM] Gary Teh: From the USA foreign direct investment and near shoring perspective displacing part of the $5 billion chocolate import and redirecting it from Brazil sounds reasonable 

- no USA jobs were lost

- ⁠encourage local community industrial growth 

- ⁠support climate change goals 

- ⁠deepen trade relationship with Brazil 

- ⁠displace Brazil trade relationship with China by reduced export of cattle and soy bean

_PS: it’s fascinating to observe how one simple action can cause such huge second and third order impact_

Influencer positive response rate was around 16%

An influencer who has accumulated a lot of followers based on her weigh loss journey would be someone that is perfect to showcase our cacao nibs. Since that is what alot of folks who follow a Keto diet end up consuming

Someone like influencer who started her weigh loss journey from 300lbs

[3/6/24, 9:49:54 PM] Gary Teh: 9 out of the 10 influencers we reached out today is fighting obesity. Some of them already having lost more than 100lb

Something clicked in my head just now when looking through this afternoon’s qualitative signals 

Each physical human body has a configuration range where it’s considered healthy. The body’s consciousness intuitively knows that

Nature does not do anything extraneous. When the body is healthy. It is naturally attractive regardless of biological age. 

These influencers from today’s marketing outreach efforts intuitively know their current configuration is not within the healthy range and trying to restore balance to their internal system 

Gaia (_the universe_) is attempting to restore balance not just in the rainforest but also in the human body ‎<This message was edited>

Consciousness intuitively knows beauty when it beholds it within its field of awareness.

Beauty can exist in the physical body or in the natural environment 

Beauty is a natural indicator of health within an organism as well as the ecosystem.

Consciousness is naturally drawn to love and beauty. ‎<This message was edited>

[3/10/24, 11:04:36 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 could you help source for the contact details of three call centers based in India that we can reach out to within your network?

There are two customer acquisition strategies we are right now testing for @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once each one is validated we plan to scale them by retaining the service of a call center 

That way we can just throw more headcount’s into the outbound saled team using th profit generated as we scale our sales volume. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/13/24, 8:42:11 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections on this ultra high purchase price set by the exchange*

Though the sale and purchase prices are different, it has achieved the same desired effect. 

Contributors who _mine_ the TDG governance tokens with their physical time and effort to build our projects or pay for project expenses using USD fiat are gifted TDG as tokens of appreciation for their contributions

While speculators on the CEX exchanges who just want to buy into the tokens, end up paying elevated purchase prices. 

_Added bonus:_
Contributors/Miners who wants to cash out some of their tokens to cover personal daily expenses can do so at the original TDG exchange rate without being penalized for cashing out early by having to sell at Cash in vault per issued token valuation

I assume the exchange is probably the one making the surplus from the sale of TDG at the ultra elevated prices 

Overall Win-Win-Win-Win 🙂🙏

_PS: In that regard all our Instagram reels as well as our Ledger of records resembles some variant of the Bitcoin Proof of Work protocol… but in this case the work is done by actual humans in the real world for stuff that needs done instead of machines in the cloud_

[7/13/24, 12:06:52 PM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour conversing with Meta AI to critically analyze Karen’s proposal 

Seems she is proposing to utilize technologies solutions from centigrade.earth and then do the buy and sell of the carbon credit via her nature wired MVP 

Further analysis of her LinkedIn profile shows her background is primarily in marketing

Makes more sense to tap directly into centigrade.earth for the carbon credit issue if they already have a streamlined process in place

If centigrade.earth already have buyers as well then I don’t see where nature wired would be impactful

Karen’s main value add will likely be marketing the issued carbon credit to potential buyers in the USA market if centigrade.earth does not already have a pipe line of carbon Credit buyers

But If she can’t find buyers for the carbon credit, I don’t really see where the actual value add is by complicating the technology stack allowing nature wired MVP into it 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

[3/13/24, 3:53:42 PM] Gary Teh: Finished reaching out to 101 TikTok influencers via TikTok messaging app

Up next, I will be reaching out to this same influencers on the list who have not responded to my messages yet. 

This time we do so via email and also track if they have opened and read the email. This will give us some insight on the attractiveness of our CTA (_call to action_) before without them needing to respond to the emails
[7/14/24, 7:18:02 AM] Gary Teh: There seems to be a convention for Carbon credit can be pre-sold before the carbon credits are issued by the American carbon registry

- Agroverse
- ⁠SunMint

_PS: The ecosystem has been hammered with the collapse of Alameda and FTX. Our original market setup on the Serum protocol was defuncted. We will need to set a new market up again on the OpenBook protocol once we are ready._

_Once setup our DAO can start performing open market buybacks from DAO members who are keen to sell off tokens which they have earned through their contributions_ ‎<This message was edited>

Creating the market for our tokens will require 3 SOL. 

We can exchange for SOL using USDT in our vault or USD profits we generated once when they do get generated

[7/14/24, 2:24:30 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes studying the operations of our market maker on the LATOKEN exchange. Seems the market is right now pricing each TDG at 2USDT per share. Just sold off a second TDG to verify the sales price.

I remain curious why they are pricing it above the 1USDT that we are all contributing at. 🤔

_PS: They are probably more optimistic about the future as distant speculator than I am the daily operator in the grind._

_Reminds me of the time in the previous 3 startups. The next most critical thing that could kill us was always front and center of everybody’s attention everyday, it was easy to fall into pessimism if left unchecked._

[3/20/24, 3:05:22 PM] Gary Teh: _*Murmurs from the USA cacao market_*

After rounds of feedback gathering that @16468233438 has conducted with the USA chocolatiers, and me with the USA consumers.

The taste of Gourmet cacao is more refined due to the additional care in the processing and thus pricier. 

USA chocolatiers are accustomed to working with the usual bulk cacao supplies and their corresponding price points.

The USA chocolate connoisseur knows quality when she taste it and is willing to pay premium price for it. 

*_Proposed path forward_*
Our mission is to heal the world with love and restore its beauty. In the case of our cacao nibs, restoring our rainforest. So long as we have the opportunity to help further increases the sales and distribution of  agricultural produce grown regeneratively by the farmers, we should go for it.


- Have two product lines targets at the different target segments

- ⁠*Gourmet cacao market segment* - targeted at the direct to premium consumer market segment - cacao ceremonies, medicinal ingredients infused cacao 

- ⁠*Bulk cacao* - targeted at chocolatiers who want to enhance their brand story by supporting our climate change efforts, but don’t want to incur the premium that comes along with the gourmet cacao process.

_PS: This seems to be the norm for other brands I had the opportunity to encounter_ ‎<This message was edited>

After much curation within my personal network, looking back at 20 years of personal data as well as reading through the biographies of the top organization builders, the most important function within any organization with a commercial intent is *_Marketing (making money 💰💸💵💶💷💴🤑)*_

*_Sources*_
- Ryu - business developer
- ⁠Jerry Luk - President of Fireworks
- ⁠Peter Gwee - DAO member, 3 generation business man in the fenshui industry 
- ⁠Dad - third generation business man in the food distribution industry
- ⁠Vinod Nair - CEO money smart 
- ⁠Richard Brandon 
- ⁠Elon Musk

PS: when the *_marketing (making money)*_ function works wells, the rest of the function will automatically work well of their own accord 

Creators are drawn to a space because they enjoy the process of building a product. 

Paradoxically, to really be successful in a space, creators have to step away from the product development function and focus on the organization building itself and most especially through marketing function.

Creators that have been observed to struggle are those who cling on for too long to the product building instead of letting otters handle it. 

When the marketing function works well and starts bringing in 💴💷💶💵💸🤑, specialists from various functions will naturally get attracted into the organization to support in the other functions ‎<This message was edited>
[7/16/24, 9:29:01 PM] Gary Teh: With the holiday seasons a few months away, I think it might start making sense to reach out to the HR department of all the tech companies and Silicon Valley to ask if they would like to have door gifts given out during their holiday parties

[3/22/24, 11:30:53 AM] Gary Teh: Personally I am holding off on further deployment of efforts into the @120363045796860099@g.us 

From my perspective that is project that is in its product development phase of the Marketing 4Ps 

My sole and only focus for this year is sales and marketing of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao in the USA market 

Anything else in the DAO, not my problem… hence systemically ignored unless to do with the USA government 😎✌️ ‎<This message was edited>
[7/16/24, 10:05:59 PM] Gary Teh: Suni spoken with the tribal council of elders. They gave the go ahead after understanding at a high level what the plans for cacao trees are. 

@557191035605 is actively following up with Suni to help sort out the details.

_PS: heard from Suni that there was another project which attempted at carbon credit… Somehow it failed… Will need to figure out why it did_

_For the current scope, might be prudent to just focus on getting the cacao trees planted and growing. If it works then its reasonable to consider extending it for carbon credit issue._

[3/22/24, 2:44:39 PM] Gary Teh: After running this initial end to end process manually to get a sense of what works and what not, I spent sometime today to slightly scale up our TikTok influencer outreach process by creating this web scraping recipe on GetData.IO

https://getdata.io/data-sources/129694-tiktok-influencer-profile-page-email-address-scraping-

Given a list of shortlisted TikTok influencer profiles URL, the crawler visits each page and then extracts the email address listed on each influencer’s profile page.

We then feed it to our automated email outreach tool.

Was able to gather more than 100 email addresses within a span of 1 hour using the data gathering infrastructure ‎<This message was edited>

[7/17/24, 11:23:35 PM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour facetime with Karen Hardy

*Key Takeaways on what was discussed*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface…
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Agroverse is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/19/24, 12:19:07 AM] Gary Teh: _PS: Secondary pattern observed. When I studied DataBricks (a data lake provider based in Silicon Valley ) growth model, I observed their growth strategy for enterprise account heavily relied on timing their outreach to enterprise customers at around the time when contracts their clients have with their data infrastructure suppliers were about to expire and are becoming open to new ones._

_Climate change disruption on supply chains can be figuratively seen as Nature forcing all the enterprise buyers to rethink their current contracts with their suppliers as their suppliers were forced to drastically change price on them. This causes existing buyers to become open to new suppliers_

_Shena when she text to me 2 weeks ago mentioned that coffee farmers Costa Rica are right now facing supply disruption as well thanks to climate change._

_When there is disruption there is a market gap and when there is a market gap there is an opportunity to exploit the gap_

_It also extends beyond the agriculture industry into the real estate industry. The most dramatic example was Indonesia abandoning their current capital Jakarta to shift to a new on on the island of Kalimantan. Real estate prices shot up by more than 100X overnight on that new plot of land_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/19/24, 11:11:53 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 4 hours today at the cacao festival chatting with the _Tree to Bar_ choclate brands present to get a sense of their 
 level of motivation for shipping _tree to bar_ Choclate to USA based on the operating model that @14806488258 suggested 

They seem overall receptive to the idea of it

The very obvious entry point for the disruption is when the seller says to his fans that he has being forced to raise his price because of the change in the cost his suppliers are charging him. 

_PS: for folks out there who see any Choclate seller publicly declaring that they are being forced to change their price because of the cost of Cacao. Please do reach out to them and say that we do have reliable sources of cacao so that we can start the conversation to capitalize on the Supply Chain disruption 🙂🙏_

It was a video privately shared in the Davos channel by and Amazon tribe leader and their community as a sneak preview to their film

Please don’t share it is outside. You guys will get me into trouble if you do

It does not make sense to allow random cross promotion of projects in our DAO channels

A close analogy is a TikTok employee going into Facebook office in Menlo Park, California and then pasting posters about TikTok products on the walls of Facebook office 

A security guard working for Facebook overseeing the premise will end up recognizing the out of place posters as such (_vandalism_) and then removing them 

A DAO Is decentralized and autonomous in how it governance itself, but at the end of the day it is still an organization. Organization needs to behave like an organization. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[7/22/24, 12:27:44 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 spent 30 minutes suggesting Agroverse is not just a bag of cacao nibs and the Amazon

When USA consumers buy a bag of Agroverse cacao nibs they are not just getting the nibs for themselves but also a bite size experience of Brazil 

The booth in the USA where we sell the cacao should include music of Brazil, displays of Brazil as well as the smell of Brazil 

_PS: reminds me of all the nomad folks as well as folks in the Pacific Northwest asking that I take a lot of photos during my visit in the southern hemisphere_ 

_And in the exact words of Melody a Native American from Northern America so that she could live vicariously through the experience._ ‎<This message was edited>

It would be a total logistic nightmare for Suni to need to setup individual tree tracking and associate it with each bag of cacao nibs sold

[4/14/24, 11:43:49 PM] Gary Teh: Had this chat @918017107841 this morning regarding the pursuit of market opportunities business development wise

DAO has eyes and ears over the place, spread across six continents to be exact. It’s a really wide net which ends up picking up a lot of opportunities. More opportunities than DAO has resources to pursue

At this point, it makes sense to follow the GE rule

Unless DAO has an unfair advantage that other players in the market niche don’t, and DAO can see a path to end up either the leader or close second in the market niche associated with a market opportunity, we will not deploy our resources to pursue the opportunity

This should further help us focus on where resources should be deployed

This also mean, we will end up saying no to around 99% of the opportunities that come our way ‎<This message was edited>

[4/18/24, 9:07:14 PM] Gary Teh: *Thoughts regarding @120363044028036610@g.us*

_Current value that we need to offer our customers (people who buy from us)_

- underwriting the risk of renegade suppliers

- ⁠verifying suppliers are legitimate and not scammers 

- providing the financing to bring in the shipment 

_Another critical value that we need to offer our customers_

- proper hedging so that our customers do not experience wild price fluctuations and supply shortage which is becoming increasingly critical during this unpredictable phase of climate change

_PS: the farmers are not our customers. While the core purpose of the @120363044028036610@g.us project is to help them help restore our rainforest, at the end of the day, they are still suppliers_ ‎<This message was edited>

Based on the ongoing conversations he’s been having with the NASA and SpaceX engineers based here in Silicon Valley, we are 5 to 10 years away from moon surface colonization

Decentralized infrastructure is going to be a key aspect of this ecosystem we are building since we should be expecting more and more far-flung colonies in outer space

_PS: the idea of AI/robotics powered mining of ore in harsh environments that @14806488258 surfaced yesterday during lunch has once again surfaced. In this case from the surface of the moon_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/22/24, 11:10:29 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like we’ve somehow opened the Pandora box with the listing of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchange

Prior to this, no one from the centralized exchanges seem to care or were interested to talk to us (_not that we tried very hard_)

Suddenly, we have a huge influx of centralized cryptocurrency exchange listing managers queueing up wanting us to list our governance tokens on their centralized exchanges

My sense is the fact the trading value of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchanges is holding up has provided a strong signal that the underlying token economics of our DAO  is financially sound hence why it caught their interest

_PS: my sense is we should maintain the relationship and hold them at bay while we focus on our core operations which is to drive the sales volume of shipments into USA_

_once we have hit the 50% sales completion mark of the next shipment, negotiate for the best deal from amongst these other CEX and then list on just one. This will help maintain if not boost the sense of exclusivity that comes with the opportunity to list our governance tokens_

_this is much like the strategy that Gmail used to roll out to release of its service to its early users as well as the way Waymo is rolling is right now rolling out self driving taxi to early users in San Francisco_ ‎<This message was edited>

*Outcome:*
- cacao butter manufacturing facility does not have the sanitario certification from Brazil to handle export to USA
- ⁠ cacao molasses facility is right now two facilities. Interim facility and new facility.
- ⁠weather condition is too bad for us to drive to the farm to inspect the equipment used to drain cacao honey from cacao beans 
- ⁠cacao harvesting begins next month 

*Follow ups* 
- Orlantildes will help introduce cacao butter facility in São Paulo which I will visit and certify 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide the photo of the equipment on the farm that drains the cacao honey from the cacao beans 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide exact details on how cacao molasses are processed from cacao honey 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide shots of new equipments setup in the new cacao molasses facility once it is up and running in three months
- ⁠ with details provided by Orlantildes I will draft up FDA FSVP inspection document to be signed for the production of cacao molasses

We are expecting the packaging material to arrive this coming Friday on 2nd August

[7/30/24, 11:31:12 AM] Gary Teh: #UPU insights

Met a nomad here in Itacare who has been cycling around South America for the past 13 years.

After volunteering to help man her store while she went to visit the bathroom, she mentioned when mailing the same package from Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil to Europe, the shipping cost is so vastly different

- Costa Rica to Europe - USD10
- ⁠Colombia to Europe - USD30
- ⁠Brazil to Europe - USD40

Time spent gathering insight was 30 minutes ‎<This message was edited>

[7/30/24, 12:48:32 PM] Gary Teh: Spent five minutes responding to all the cryptocurrency central exchange listing managers that are trying to get DAO attention on cryptocurrency exchange listing matters

Directing all of them to our telegram channel where they can wait for update on when they can finally gain an audience with DAO

https://t.me/TrueSightDAO

_PS: from my perspective, channeling updates via telegram is the most effective way of disseminating information to non-governance token holders who wants to get something from the DAO, but not ready or motivated to put it any resource on their part to exchange for what they desire (aka Nothing)._

_in telegram nobody knows who anyone else is. So everyone is kept on the toes guessing who the other people on the channel are and if they are competitors for the resources or resource controllers_

_this also minimizes the noise and distraction experienced by actual DAO members doing the work_ ‎<This message was edited>

*Follow up steps*

- compile the list of all prior contributions associated with Agroverse guild in relationship to the setting up of the Brazilian supply chain into USA and then submitting them

- set up periodic submission of contributions associated with Agroverse guild in relationships to the setting up of the Brazilian supply chain into USA and then submitting them

_PS: something interesting to explore is reimbursement for the man hours that were contributed by DAO members to setup this piece of infrastructure and then utilizing this reimbursement to back the value of our TDG / USDT exchange rate on the LATOKEN token exchange_


Thanks for helping setup the meeting @14102184337

- USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) is actively building out Brazilian exports volume into USA 

- ⁠USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) has retained the service of an army of freelancers at a rate of 100USD/hour 

- ⁠labor expenses are incurred whenever freelancers time are engaged to build out supply chain for Brazilian exports into USA

- ⁠labor expenses are incurred whenever freelancers time are engaged to perform sales and marketing activities to drive Brazilian export volume into USA 

- ⁠expenses are also incurred when other vendors charge USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) for service rendered in USD to facilitate Brazilian export into USA 

- ⁠expenses are paid in TDG currency with an exchange rate of 1TDG = 1USD

- ⁠payment for each expense line items are recorded on the blockchain ‎<This message was edited>

[8/3/24, 11:41:46 AM] Gary Teh: Just did up the initial financial projection for the upcoming shipment from Coopercabruca - *_aka AGL3*_

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ji-p9z6fMhb0A30lsW2r0hryzJGsDRBgM3vRnn9tCiU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

- Estimate cost of goods before freighting and customs clearance cost to be financed: $10,876.19
- ⁠Total expected returns on shipment: $12,183.81 (_112.02%_)
- ⁠Total amount to be made by DAO after shipment sales completion in USA market: $10,514.64
- ⁠Total returns to financiers: $1,669.17 (_15.35% return on capital injected_)

_PS: DAO needs to recoup the resources it has already deployed so far to build out the supply chain between Brazil and USA_

_My sense is the exceptionally high Gas fee of 86% charged by DAO will probably turn off most financiers, however let’s just consider it already been fully financed_

_If AGL3 gets fully sold out wonderful, Agroverse project will continue. If not, then we will shutdown Agroverse along with the entire DAO. Then I will finally enter into the Zen monastery for permanent wall facing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/24, 11:56:18 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this shipment is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. 

On the bright side, We have 1 year upon arrival of shipment within the borders of USA to fully offload the entire shipment before it gets donated in its entirety to @16504369509 project for homeless rehabilitation and the @120363044028036610@g.us and the DAO shutdown in its entirety

[8/5/24, 10:10:53 AM] Gary Teh: The USA stock market experiences its largest crash since 24th Sep 2022 on the day our purchase order was issued

Meanwhile major crypto currencies experiences their largest nosedive 

This should perhaps applies some downward pressure on prices of cacao we are planning to purchase since prices quoted to us are tied to multiples of the cacao futures prices… 2.3X to be exact 🤔

[8/7/24, 4:56:55 PM] Gary Teh: After a quick afternoon inspection into the whole web3 practice of spending tokens to gain publicity to drive up interest in tokens, my conclusion is that it is both a waste of time and resources that could  otherwise be better deployed towards building the actual product(_s_)

The later scenario is also known as someone paying for something useful that will either

1. result in more USD in our vault because they paid using USD

2. result in less TDG in circulation because they paid using TDG

_PS: I will no longer spend my time entertaining incoming proposals where we pay TDG to get more people excited about our TDG._

_The ideal scenario we should be targeting is someone has no choice but to either acquire TDG or give us USD for something they really need done… for example clearing their agricultural produce imports with the USA FDA agency_ ‎<This message was edited>

Just one more small step and we would have the TDG tabulation fully automated on Telegram… Should probably be done by tomorrow.

I am going to start doing my DAO specific contributions reporting over on the Telegram channel instead. 

Meanwhile I will continue doing my Agroverse related contributions reporting on our Agroverse channel.

@31641075825 for the NGO internship thingy that you were mentioning, might make sense to just gather all of them into a Telegram channel and then be done with it. 

Once they are all gathered there then tabulating their contributions based on our 4 rules tokenomics is trivial ‎<This message was edited>

Now that our tokens are actively trading and folks have actively taken on operating scopes that’s previously on my plate, i’m starting to see myself transitioning more and more to playing the role of the CFO

Another two weeks before it’s ready for for shipping to the USA
[8/14/24, 9:27:51 PM] Gary Teh: I spoke with Orlantildes this morning

Once I get back to the US will run a focus group to get a sense of USA consumer interest in caramelize Cacao almonds  using the 7 variants that we have.

[8/15/24, 1:46:35 PM] Gary Teh: Was speaking with @557191035605 yesterday and this crystallized during the conversation

*Our purpose*
Heal the world with love by building a better world based on verifiable truth 

*Our core values*
- autonomy
- ⁠integrity
- ⁠diversity

*Our mission*
Sell organic cacao grown using cabruca regenerative technique in the Amazon rainforest so as to finance the planting of trees via cabruca agroforestry to restore it. 

*Vision* 
Shift 1% of total US chocolate consumption to organic cacao grown in the Amazon rainforest using cabruca regenerative technique by 2030. 

*Key statistics*
- _Total USA chocolate consumption in 2023 was USD$19 billion._
- _1% is USD$190 million._

I spent 10 minutes drafting this up
[8/16/24, 2:26:45 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I am missing the strong sense of community and the power of diversity in this 😘
[8/16/24, 6:37:56 AM] Gary Teh: Totally makes sense 🤩🙏

And now we have a diversity and community of three 🤣
[8/17/24, 10:18:19 AM] Gary Teh: *Suspended the purchase order issued to Coopercabruca*

The prices they quoted for the cacao nibs and the cacao liquor are not competitive for the US market 

I observe they purchase from the farmers and resell with a markup (_of 40%_), this technically makes them a middleman.

Getting @557191035605‘s help to do a sanity check on the price against the other corporatives in Bahia 

If overall prices are at the level which is not competitive in the USA, we will suspend all shipment from Brazil this year

However if the variance of the prices are very high after doing the sanity check on prices with the other cooperatives, then it makes sense for us to establish a Local Brazilian legal wrapper entity to gain further control over the Supply Chain and to further reduce *_middlemen leakages*_

If we do go down this route, The CEO for the Brazilian legal entity will be elected based on the following criteria: 

_the DAO member with highest amount of TDG accumulated from amongst all DAO members with legal Brazilian residency over the past 12 months_

*Scope of Brazilian legal entity*

- Sourcing direct from farmers

- ⁠ generation of sales and marketing content for social media

- ⁠ sales and marketing activities into USA ‎<This message was edited>
[8/17/24, 10:28:46 AM] Gary Teh: _PS: in this scenario the title of CEO is literally a pun on the person that executed the most in the region._

_This is literally one of those classic Elon Musk first principles moment where we examine the Supply Chain and realize very quickly to our self that the 40% markup represents around approximately US$9000._

_This money could otherwise be used to go a long way towards establishing a replica of that section of the Supply Chain that was previously handled by middleman and securing long term cost savings. Savings that could be used to boost the value of our TDG 🤔_ ‎<This message was edited>

[8/20/24, 8:34:20 AM] Gary Teh: Shena spent 10 minutes yesterday explaining about the trend that’s happening with Gen Z and millennials yesterday evening

That demographic does not consume much alcohol and they are looking for alternate replacements that has not just juice, but contains herbal properties as well

The kids that don’t drink they make as much money 

They would rather spend money on experiences then going to the bar and drinking $20 cocktails

Mocktail is the in thing in right now ‎<This message was edited>

_Objectives_
- 240 sales calls via sales lead list provided 

_Key results_ 
- successful appointments set for 24 unique stores on behalf of @16468233438 and @14102184337 combined to visit
[8/21/24, 9:39:09 PM] Val Lapidus: Where and how will I be notified of appointments?

[8/21/24, 9:41:58 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 will DM you directly 

Meanwhile you can check the status of his calls here

[8/22/24, 4:45:05 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 and @557391090002 both of you have dabbed in the retailer space at this point 

It makes sense for both of you to have a chat for knowledge sharing purposes to figure out what works and what doesn’t
[8/22/24, 9:02:10 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 1 hour updating our Offchain balance to account for the recent transfers of USD, USDT and Brazilian Reis for the following purposes

- LATOKEN market making
- ⁠Brazilian Bank account setup and Brazilian Reis debt repayment to Fatima

Our current USD balance is down to USD612.50
[8/22/24, 9:19:55 AM] Gary Teh: Now that _*OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)_* have became more widely adopted in our DAO and we have worked with it for a few iterations, I figure it is a good time for me to share my thoughts on it

From my perspective, *_Objectives_* has to do with processes and concrete tasks within the processes that DAO member undertakes. It is deterministic. By just looking at the logs, we can determine if a DAO member consistently been executing on process or not.

*_Key results_* are the outcomes. Until time set is due, we do not know for sure if the outcomes will be within our desired target range. They are probabilistic. Only a very small fraction of the inputs are within the control of DAO member undertaking the process driving these outcomes. The form of control DAO member has is the way tasks are conducted within the processes. 

The best thing we can do to improve outcome is to share with the DAO what we have learned that work and what did not as we iterate through the different variants of our processes.

Over the past quarter, I have been undertaking a very systematic process of identifying various DAO members whom I then later communicated clearly, I will not engaging in any future form of transactions within the realms of commerce, investments and money. This is primarily because enough data has been gathered to show that when given the opportunity to execute on a self-defined and agreed upon process, instead of a deterministic outcome, it ends up being a probabilistic one.

A rule I learned from our fellow DAO member Ilya who manages a hedge fund in Wall Street which seems very applicable to our domain. A fund manager cannot be faulted on _*the OUTCOME_* of a trading strategy but must definitely be faulted when he fails to diligently follow the defined trading strategy (_the PROCESS_).

Assuming sales volume continues growing at the current rate of five times per year, we would achieve our sales target by year 9. Which is seven more years from now.

We are currently in year 2. We should hit our sales revenue target for regeneratively grown Organic cacao of at least $190 million by 2032. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/1/24, 10:55:06 PM] Tess walkowski: Are you on copywriting or web design
[9/1/24, 10:55:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Both when requested. I am a ux designer / ux writer.
[9/1/24, 10:55:56 PM] Tess walkowski: I think it's a philosophical/ market research question.  What word hooks consumers.
[9/1/24, 10:56:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Agrosverse: a ceremony for everyday
[9/1/24, 10:56:54 PM] Tess walkowski: Agroverse : our cacao is ceremonial quality
[9/1/24, 10:58:03 PM] Tess walkowski: The definition I use for ceremonially cacao is made by hand, small batch, fire roasted
[9/1/24, 10:58:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Cool!
[9/1/24, 10:58:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thank you for your feedback. It is important to acknowledge that our audience includes a diverse range of individuals beyond just healers and those involved in cacao ceremonies. As a result, we will be revising the text to better reflect this broader audience.
[9/1/24, 10:59:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I loved everything about Soursop by the way.
[9/1/24, 10:59:42 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we can use ux research to grow and zero in, in time
[9/1/24, 10:59:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Users offer feedback we miss
[9/1/24, 11:01:09 PM] Tess walkowski: They started with more than us and are a few million in.  They have done it before
[9/1/24, 11:01:40 PM] Tess walkowski: I like how they had cards and questions
[9/1/24, 11:02:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Inflammation?  Solution our product
[9/1/24, 11:03:26 PM] Tess walkowski: 15 min talking to soursap ladies
[9/1/24, 11:06:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: In my opinion, it is important to understand more about healers and shamans, but also remember our audience (people into sports, wellness, organic food). The healers bring a great demand, and it is important to hear their necessities. Each member is welcome to step on and add to the table. Right now, my focus has been on suppliers in Brazil, so we have more options. Each one is analyzed very carefully and demands some time. So right now I can attend small improvements with the site (content) and take care of our digital presence.

Or else the information just get lost here because of the many messages. What do you think?
[9/1/24, 11:12:44 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It generates curiosity.
[9/1/24, 11:12:48 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I like it as well.
[9/1/24, 11:35:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes alot get lost in this thread
[9/1/24, 11:36:16 PM] Tess walkowski: Is the website relevant now for review?
[9/1/24, 11:39:36 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes. It is important to align it with the marketing strategy and once for all put us all in the same boat. Although I say that due to the cacao properties, different may see it differently. Some buy because it tastes good. Others because it helps with diets/gives energy without the spikes, others because it is sacred for them.
[9/1/24, 11:40:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Those who treat it as sacred should hop aboard and manifest it through words.
[9/1/24, 11:41:10 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we want to apply the daos core value to web design
[9/1/24, 11:41:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: These different views in the end are about the same thing, which returns to the respect and reverence of nature.

[9/1/24, 11:42:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Once you finish.
[9/1/24, 11:43:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I was thinking the same earlier today. That actually would enter as "philosophy"

[9/1/24, 11:45:36 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Being like water.
[9/1/24, 11:46:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: In the beginning it made sense to have the site as it was because we needed something small.
[9/1/24, 11:46:35 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Now I feel it is time to put more bricks, slowly.

[9/1/24, 11:47:37 PM] Tess walkowski: How do our core values separate us
[9/1/24, 11:48:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Meanwhile, I am doing other things, I will provide you with a Google form to help you synchronize the ideas. So we can filter them. This for the more complex ideas and for the site, send me prints and what do you think of.
[9/1/24, 11:48:12 PM] Tess walkowski: Why are we different etc
[9/1/24, 11:55:32 PM] Emelin - Bahia: For those following our conversation, we will keep talking in private, due to the amount of messages I am managing right now. All insights and things discussed, although I will write here after.

[9/3/24, 8:53:38 AM] Gary Teh: Solved the Upu problem presented by @14806488258 for Brasil 

The outcome is as below

Consolidate packages till 30kg before shipping to USA California
[9/3/24, 10:05:24 AM] Gary Teh: Shena spent 30 minutes last week explaining how convenience stores work since she owned and operated one for 5 years 

Vendors typically come in to check the stock and stock up every week 

For the operator, basically the initial investment is the largest 

Thereafter she only pays for what is required to stock up the inventory to the required level 

Typical profit margin is 10% 

Some really good products are like the ones she created herself. The profit margin 100% profit margin. She handmade some fishing baits. It costed her $.28 per bait. And she sold it for $5.

When she bought the convenience store, it already came with a bunch of vendor relationships 

Vendors should consider entering the shop to speak to the owner give a sample and help the owner Decide if she wants to stock the inventory.

[9/3/24, 12:37:01 PM] Tess walkowski: It is easier to scale when branding is solid.
[9/3/24, 12:37:35 PM] Tess walkowski: We are small now, but our values, plus marketing reflect our aim.
[9/3/24, 12:38:13 PM] Tess walkowski: My margins are personally at 100.   But I can't scale.
[9/3/24, 12:39:54 PM] Tess walkowski: ....but getting exclusivity with a space.... The relationships.... Are key....
[9/3/24, 12:40:17 PM] Tess walkowski: So if let's say we go exclusive with a san fran coffee shop
[9/3/24, 12:40:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Or we show new and exciting things like Gary's brewed coffee, those almonds, those mango smoothies.
[9/3/24, 1:50:29 PM] Gary Teh: I shared this framework based on the Pareto principle with @557191035605 earlier today which I think will be useful to reshare here again.

It pertains to how random unstructured qualitative conversation data is gathered from the general community and then tabulated into concrete actionable insights which eventually leads to entirely new products or product features added to a product management team’s execution roadmap

_PS: This means while all your valuable inputs are taken into account, they might not translate literally into products or product features on the DAO’s execution roadmap_ ‎<This message was edited>
[9/3/24, 2:28:29 PM] Gary Teh: After conducting multiple cacao farm inspections over the past14 months, I figured to surface this proposal that will allow authorized DAO members to onboard new organic cacao farms from Brazil on to our Agroverse network. That way, cacao farm inspection and onboarding does not need to be bottlenecked by my availability in the local proximity.

[9/3/24, 2:31:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The *absence of residues from cleaning agents or pesticides*
[9/3/24, 2:32:37 PM] Emelin - Bahia: To ensure that a cacao tree is part of a totally organic production system, several key practices and principles need to be followed. Here’s a comprehensive look at what makes cacao production organic:

1. No Synthetic Chemicals
Pesticides and Herbicides: Organic cacao production avoids synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Instead, it uses natural pest control methods and organic-approved substances.
Fertilizers: Chemical fertilizers are replaced with organic fertilizers like compost, manure, and green manure.
2. Soil Health and Management
Organic Matter: Organic farming emphasizes the use of organic matter to maintain soil fertility. This includes composting, mulching, and green manuring.
Soil Conservation: Techniques such as cover cropping and reduced tillage are used to maintain soil health and prevent erosion.
3. Pest and Disease Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Organic cacao farms use IPM strategies, which include biological control agents (like beneficial insects), companion planting, and manual removal of pests.
Disease Prevention: Practices such as proper spacing, pruning, and the use of resistant cacao varieties help prevent disease.
4. Sustainable Farming Practices
Water Management: Efficient water use and conservation practices are crucial to prevent waterlogging and maintain soil structure.
Biodiversity: Organic cacao farms often incorporate agroforestry practices, maintaining a diverse ecosystem to support natural predators and improve soil health.
5. Certification
Organic Certification: To be recognized as organic, cacao farms must obtain certification from an accredited organic certifying body. This involves adhering to specific standards and undergoing regular inspections.
6. Non-GMO Seeds
Seed Sourcing: Organic cacao production requires using non-GMO seeds and plants. Cacao varieties should be chosen based on their organic compatibility.
7. Sustainable Practices
Energy Use: Organic farms strive to use renewable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint.
Waste Management: Organic cacao producers manage waste through composting and recycling to minimize environmental impact.
8. Ethical Labor Practices
Fair Trade: Many organic cacao farms also follow fair trade principles, ensuring fair wages and ethical treatment of workers.
9. No Synthetic Additives in Processing
Processing: When processing cacao, organic certification ensures that no synthetic additives, artificial flavors, or colors are used.
[9/3/24, 2:34:00 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 just granted you editing rights to the document
[9/3/24, 2:34:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: In my point of view, the additional photo proof can be skipped once they have the seal.
[9/3/24, 2:34:30 PM] Gary Teh: For the chemical residue yes. BUt for the rest no as they pertain to the actual handling
[9/3/24, 2:34:38 PM] Gary Teh: As per HACCP requirements
[9/3/24, 2:34:48 PM] Gary Teh: Hazard Analysis critical control points.
[9/3/24, 2:35:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: And even with the seal, there are some requirements for those who are gonna check if it is legit.
[9/3/24, 2:35:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Verification of the Certificate
Confirmation with the Certifier: The seal usually includes the name of the certifying body. You can verify the validity of the seal by contacting the certifying body directly or visiting their official website to confirm if the farm is listed as certified.
2. Seal Consistency
Authenticity of the Seal: Make sure the seal looks authentic and is from a recognized certification organization. A counterfeit seal or one from an unknown organization may be a red flag.
3. International Recognition
Recognized Certifying Bodies: Check if the seal belongs to a certification body recognized internationally, such as USDA Organic (USA), EU Organic (European Union), or other certifications recognized in your country.
4. Farm Documentation
Request Documentation: If possible, ask the farm or supplier for more information about the certification, including documents and records proving compliance with organic standards.
5. Transparency and Traceability
Additional Information: Organic products often come with information about their origin and the certification process. Transparency in how the product was grown and processed is a good sign of authenticity.
6. References and Reviews
Research the Farm: If possible, research the reputation of the farm or supplier. Feedback from other consumers and reliable references can help ensure authenticity.
7. Consider Brand Trustworthiness
Reputable Brands: Buying from reputable brands and distributors with experience in organic products can increase confidence that the seal is legitimate.

They only concern themselves with food safety. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/3/24, 2:40:21 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If someone ask, you can just ask them to read the document and they will see why their product is organic as well.
[9/3/24, 2:40:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: But it is important for the clients.
[9/3/24, 2:40:58 PM] Emelin - Bahia: And for our reputation. If we go organic, we do organic.
[9/3/24, 2:41:30 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Non organic is less costly btw. But we went with organic and sustainability so we should be sure to hold to that.
[9/3/24, 2:41:31 PM] Gary Teh: That is correct.
[9/3/24, 2:41:40 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Mainly people who will be checking the farms.
[9/3/24, 2:44:37 PM] Gary Teh: Later on as we observe more USA consumer demand for other cacao derivatives, we might extend our DAO crowdsourcing inspection to include those stages. Examples

- cacao nibs production
- ⁠cacao liquor production
- ⁠cacao molasses production
- ⁠cacao powder production
- ⁠cacao butter production

[9/7/24, 2:01:02 PM] Gary Teh: I just did a check with the FDA’s portal for FDA agents. There is a simple option to submit a notice that there is an inbound commercial mail containing food that is being sold directly to USA buyer

This will support the route where we send cacao products up to 30 kg using the local postal office in Brazil and where buyer is legally allowed by the USA FDA agency  to resell to consumers

I spent 5 minutes doing the necessary fact checking. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/7/24, 2:35:42 PM] Gary Teh: I was just relooking into the mathematics of AGL2 freighting and customs clearance cost for 100kg from Ilheus to USA  

Customs clearance: USD$5.21
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231117_payment_for_customs_clearance_taxes_airport_handling.pdf

Airfreight cost per kg: USD$7.15
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231109_100KG_flight_from_salvador_to_sfo.pdf

Trucking services per kg: USD$1.90
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231109_100KG_transport_from_Coopercabruca_to_Salvador_invoice.pdf

Total cost was USD14.26 per kg….

Compare to sending packages over to USA via local post office in 30KG parcels where customs is automatically cleared by the postal service.
Total cost was USD10.86 per kg…


For smaller quantities, why even bother dealing with freighting companies… 🤔🤷‍♂️ ‎<This message was edited>

[9/7/24, 10:12:25 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We have been living really chaotic situations due to the wildfires in the Amazon. Except northeast, Brazil has been living extreme air conditions. To those interested, we posted about it: https://www.instagram.com/p/C_ouSvwsLpB/ Our cacao and some teammates as myself come from the clean area on the map.

[9/8/24, 6:26:26 PM] Tess walkowski: So 30 kg post from Brazil is cheaper?
[9/8/24, 6:27:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is about 65 lb
[9/8/24, 6:27:50 PM] Tess walkowski: I have heard some rumors it has to be under 65 for the dhl shipping to cross customs
[9/8/24, 6:28:19 PM] Tess walkowski: My starting shipping for a 30 lb shipment from Colombia is shipping cost about $225
[9/8/24, 7:00:35 PM] Gary Teh: From Brazil is US$247 to ship 65 lbs
[9/9/24, 6:08:13 AM] Gary Teh: Guess we are once again ahead of the curve 🤔

[9/9/24, 5:47:42 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 45 minutes doing cost analysis for small batch shipments from Brazil direct to USA retailers

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aMB3JJWTE0RI6saVt-4LU5sIFmw39FhQnvq_Cj3GTVE/edit?usp=sharing

If a cacao derivative product conforms to the following then it is economically viable for any shipment that is above 10kg

- acceptable retail price USD$10
- ⁠cost of goods sold is less than USD$5 
- ⁠net weight per unit is below 250grams.
[9/9/24, 6:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: From a portfolio risk management perspective, it is prudent to quickly ship 5kg and fail than to ship 100kg and then realized we failed thereafter be stuck with a truckload of inventory to be offloaded at a loss 😱

5kg is equivalent to 25 units 

And The test can be done very quickly too. With just a taste testing session with around 20 participants 

If the product is so delicious, bulk if not all of the entire shipment will be sold out by the time 2 taste testing is completed. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/9/24, 6:22:18 PM] Tess walkowski: Is your minimum really 1000kg? So cool though!
[9/9/24, 6:41:18 PM] Gary Teh: More tiers getting voted into existence
[9/9/24, 9:13:34 PM] Tess walkowski: I think as me learn about economics we will find a market for those 60-100 lb orders
[9/9/24, 9:14:26 PM] Tess walkowski: There is research which shows that cacao holds nutrition even at 75 year!
[9/9/24, 9:14:58 PM] Tess walkowski: 5kg will move quick
[9/9/24, 9:15:31 PM] Tess walkowski: If I had cash I would also immediately buy like 10kg of almonds! I think it will be a winner!
[9/9/24, 9:15:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I ate all mine before I reached the USA!
[9/9/24, 9:18:28 PM] Tess walkowski: You got $50 shipping from Brazil for small orders? That's incredible! That the costs are that low and that's solved.
[9/9/24, 9:21:46 PM] Tess walkowski: If any other group members have had chocolate "almond"  I call them caramelized cacao beans though one could say caramelized cacao nut.  This food brings out an amazing flavour! And adds Carmel.   It's addictive.   Pop in your mouth yummy snack just like chips with enough sweet and salt. This is an amazing product! I bought it folded in a little carton. It would look beautiful next to our nibs.

I finally got to take a look at the scratch on the car which we got after narrowly swerving away from the truck that cut in front of us. 

I think all three of us could have died this afternoon

[9/12/24, 10:15:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.
