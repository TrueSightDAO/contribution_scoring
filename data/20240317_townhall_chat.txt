https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUBd6E2cFwFMBDLURS-SxCY75AlJ7sPtUklXi0N8hR4/edit?usp=sharing

Non-governors will be welcomed to sit in during that session as an observer 

In-line with the new governance model, EcoVerse21 will be having a meeting where active members discuss and define the tokenizable actions within the scope of that project 

EcoVerse21 will submit for approval to our main DAO governance tokens allocation to facilitate out the next phase of its planned roadmap

One of the key principles he mentioned was allowing the ability to bifurcate

This means when it starts becoming obvious that two conflicting context starts surfacing within a channel, it is time to split it into two. 

In hindsight splitting our main channel into the Beer Hall and the Town Hall with separate but very well defined context make absolute sense

My stance, being very rule based profile, I follow the 3/7 principle

If 3 members independently complain about a phenomena, it falls under the might need to address category of problems

If 7 members independently complain about a phenomena, it falls under the must be addressed ASAP category of problems 

I remember Reid mentioning his strategy of triaging when they were rapidly scaling LinkedIn in the early days. 

Something was always going wrong all the time. And it is impossible to fix everything during blitz scaling mode. 

The most important task is to figure out which are the subset of most critical problems that must be addressed and the rest can continue burning while the team heads back home to sleep

[4/3/23, 3:22:04 AM] Gary Teh: The irony of things, I remember when I was in the Mojave desert back in early 2021 during winter and was coming to a conclusion to myself it was probably not a good idea to have built an entire webscraping infrastructure tuned specifically for AI model training needs. This conclusion was due to the total lack of companies operating in the space 

Fast forward two years later, we are suddenly seeing an explosion in the population size of companies operating in the AI space. 

I am right now in my head toying with how to extend our  DAO’s tokenomics to include GetData.IO as part the ecosystem and if that works out, start channeling part of its monthly subscription revenue proceeds to our DAO’s vault as defined in the governance framework defined by @381644913030 in exchange for DAO support

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUBd6E2cFwFMBDLURS-SxCY75AlJ7sPtUklXi0N8hR4/edit?usp=sharing

Two areas where GetData.IO could potentially benefit regarding assistance from the DAO would be data set discovery/creation and marketing of these datasets to Ai companies that need these data sets 

One area where GetData.IO could extend the utility of our governance tokens is to start accepting it in exchange for data downloads

Open to any thoughts you might have. Let’s discuss 🙂👍

[4/4/23, 6:28:29 PM] Gary Teh: Been chatting with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 for the past two hours. 

Seems we gotten down to first principles during our discussions which tied somehow to the key principles of Buddhism

3 nature of reality
- impermanent 
- unsatisfactory 
- no-self

Anytime any of this three is transgressed, craving and aversion naturally arises 

Any individual who can’t self regulate away this craving and aversion will end up paying to have it go away

Any Business model needs to fundamentally address a key craving or aversion that a large enough group of people have, other it serves no purpose 

I believe that should be the core component in each of our projects 

That said, @5491125130580  has proposed a technical solution that could be implemented for Cypher defense. We will test the value proposition against 10 subjects in our defined target market tomorrow when we visit the local tech hub to verify their willingness to pay USD10 for the pain to go away 

If they do, then we would have very cheaply validated a monthly subscription business model for cypher defense

[4/5/23, 5:57:15 PM] Gary Teh: I think it became really obvious after today’s 8 hours long discussion with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 that what initially catalyzed TrueSight DAO coming into being was figuring out a complex solution in a decentralized manner to tackle the complex multi faceted problem of fake news.

However when our DAO started experimenting with forking the original prediction market project last august and opening up our ecosystem to support new projects that are aligned with our core values of Autonomy, Integrity and Diveristy, it catalyzed a shift in our collective narration

Fast forward 8 months into this collective inductive process, seems our mission has fully shifted away from tackling fake news 

Right now, taking a step back and looking at our DAO as a external observer, what is obvious is our DAO is really attempting to find an answer to this three questions 


1) Autonomy to be - Discovering what the future form of organization is. One that is rule based and without a central authority. One where individuals have the freedom to grow in any direction their professional aspiration takes them. 

2) Integrity to self - Discovering how communities of people could collaborate and work together in an asynchronous and distributed fashion that allows them to live with integrity that is aligned with their high order purpose. The second order effect of this is that we should see less people experiencing anxiety and depression

3) Preserving our diversed natural ecosystems - Discovering and implementing business models that are not just aligned with profits but also aligned with nature.

[4/5/23, 6:29:45 PM] Gary Teh: In essence all the spaces within our DAO are endeavors by our community to bring our core values to different domains of concern. I usually refer to the game Unchartered Waters as well as the activities of the British East India company when describing the domains of concern.

These are namely Exploration, Commerce and Military.


SunMint ( our DAO's physical territories )
    - in the near term. Preserving the autonomy of our DAO so as to negate the need for external financing by directly converting solar energy into BitCoins which we can then use to finance other projects within our ecosystem. 
    - In the long term, establishing an off the grid data center network which we will run Edgar from.
    - In the long term, a worldwide network of facilities that DAO members can stay when move from one geographical territory to another


Edgar (Exploration - insight generation)
    - right now: providing the much needed integrity for financial news to help community make financial decisions so that they can retain autonomy on how they live their lives. 
    - future vision: the bot that will answer any questions new members might have about our history and how they can onboard
    

Beer Hall (Exploration - insight generation)
   - providing multifaceted interpretation of current occurrences within the realms of geopolitics


Ecoverse21 (Commerce)
    - Building a trading network that fosters adoption of sustainable farming practices worldwide, with its integrity secured by the use of blockchain. 
    - Firstly, this preserves the autonomy of small scale farmers. 
    - Secondly, preserves diversity within our natural ecosystem by fighting against large scale mono-culture farming practices which are not sustainable


Cypher Defense (Military)
    - Providing the integrity layer that protects members against phishing scams which attempt to compromise the autonomy of web3 actors through disinformation practices.

The website will be what Gary has already created in terms of the management of the token and etc along with the newer additions

There is a need to put all this information to make it more manageable from for existing members to know the processes and opportunities that are available to further develop so they can make better informed decisions moving forward 

 and for newer members to know which route they can adopt

The main outcome is that as a DAO we become more proactive not only in conversation but in other aspects. To acknowledge where do I stand and what we would like to do. 

We are also currently defining the roles people are adopting on the DAO and also what the other roles required for the DAO and independent projects 

I would urge everyone to join this conversation via the figma or independently so we have a collective and comprehensive vision as a community

[4/8/23, 5:20:35 AM] Gary Teh: Hi folks, @918017107841 has very kindly assembled a list of grants that we could start applying to to fill up our DAO’s treasury.

The reason why we want to fill up our treasury is to enable us to pursue some of our project goals which will require some amount of fiat. 

The list can be found here 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11UXh0HmeRbZTS705XIli-UEiSJioMg4zArd7BTeoi5o/edit

Before we go about the phase of applying to these grants, I would like to propose that we add more sources that we might be aware of to the list 

This activity is a tokenizable one. Each new line entry will yield you 25TDG 

In the next phase, we will go through and apply for liquidity from the listed grants. 

Each application attempt will yield you 100TDG  

Each successful application will yield you 10% of the grant amount received 

This means if you successfully helped our DAO bring in USD10,000 worth of grants, you will be awarded 1000TDG. 🙂👍
[4/8/23, 5:23:59 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s aim to compile what we can by the end of this month 🙂👍

[4/8/23, 8:31:58 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through our DAO’s operating process just now, it occurred to me there might end up being potential conflict of interest between contributors within the scope of projects 

This scenario arises when project members collaboratively do RnD within the scope of a project and a member chooses to take the collective work done and spin up a separate project on the side to privately capture the value of the efforts for himself/herself

Let’s do a poll to get a sense of our stance on this matter 🙂
[4/8/23, 8:34:12 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
members should be allowed to take RnD materials surfaced within the project chatrooms and privately use these for their personal gains
‎OPTION: That is unethical and we should have agreements in place to curtail that (8 votes)
‎OPTION: Allow free flowing of insights into and out of the DAO will benefit the ecosystem as a whole (1 vote)
[4/8/23, 9:47:03 AM] Alessandro Mele: Good point @14153000019 ! I think we should have another option, which I would vote for. Which is to allow members to monetise outside of the DAO the RnD developed as long as such member notifies the DAO of such intentions, invites other members who had contributed to such RnD to the spin off and a commercial agreement is reached for the commercial exploitation of such RnD. If no agreement is reached I would agree with point 1 as unilaterally exploring RnD developed with the contribution of others would be unethical.

[4/8/23, 4:04:58 PM] Gary Teh: @972556609556 and @447887692903 these are very insightful inputs 

Definitely there seems to be a need to figure such a framework that allows DAO members to commercialize the RnD efforts of the DAO and then channel part of the proceeds of the commercialization to re-energize the DAO. 

In essence allow the natural formation of a symbiotic relationship 🙂🙏
[4/8/23, 4:08:28 PM] Gary Teh: In fact from my perspective, such a legal framework would be useful for other DAOs in the future as well. 

It would be useful to hear the thoughts of legal practitioners here in our community 

@41799155602 @381644913030 @41791555798 🙂👍
[4/8/23, 10:19:36 PM] Gary Teh: I posed this question to ChatGpt 

What is a good legal framework that we can use to ensure members do not utilize RnD materials contributed by other members in the DAO in an unauthorized manner that does not benefit the DAO?
[4/8/23, 10:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: When it comes to ensuring that members do not utilize RnD materials contributed by other members in the DAO in an unauthorized manner that does not benefit the DAO, a good legal framework to consider is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

An NDA is a legal document that protects sensitive or confidential information that is shared between two or more parties. It can be used to protect intellectual property rights, trade secrets, and other confidential information. An NDA ensures that members are prohibited from disclosing any confidential information to unauthorized individuals, using it for their advantage outside of the DAO, or utilizing certain intellectual property rights in a way that is detrimental to the DAO.

The following are the key elements of a basic NDA framework that can be adapted to fit the requirements of your DAO:

1. Definition of Confidential Information: The NDA should define the types of information that are considered confidential and should not be disclosed outside the DAO without prior written authorization.

2. Scope of Confidentiality: The NDA should specify the scope of confidentiality, including the duration of the non-disclosure obligation and the purpose for which the confidential information is being shared.

3. Obligations of the Recipient: The NDA should specify the obligations and responsibilities of the recipient towards the confidential information, including how the recipient can use the confidential information and who can access it.

4. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights: The NDA should describe how any intellectual property rights associated with the confidential information will be protected.

5. Remedies and Enforcement: The NDA should include provisions for breach of the agreement, which should clarify the remedies available to the disclosing party, including legal actions and damages.

It is important to consider the possible legal consequences of a breach of an NDA and to seek legal advice to ensure that the legal framework is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. The NDA will establish a legal framework that protects your DAO's intellectual property rights, ensures trust between members and promotes the development of RnD materials among the participants.
[4/8/23, 10:25:40 PM] Gary Teh: I posed the question to ChatGpt to come up with a legal framework to do so with this question 

Create a legal framework that allows member to utilize RnD materials contributed by other DAO members which allows them to commercialize these RnD efforts while allowing for a symbiotic relationship between the newly registered entities commercializing the RnD and the DAO which seeded the RnD efforts
[4/8/23, 10:25:52 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Sure, below is a legal framework that a DAO can use to allow members to utilize RnD materials contributed by other members, leading to the commercialization of these RnD efforts, while developing a symbiotic relationship between the newly registered entities and the DAO which seeded the RnD efforts:

1. Licensing Agreement: The DAO will enter into a licensing agreement with the newly registered entities that will allow them to utilize the RnD materials contributed by other DAO members under specific terms and conditions. This licensing agreement will outline the scope of fees for utilization, the manner in which these fees will be apportioned, the restrictions and obligations, and the expected period of commercialization.

2. Intellectual Property Ownership: Each contributing member of the RnD effort should retain the right to own their respective IP, and such ownership rights will be outlined in the licensing agreement.

3. Revenue Sharing and Royalties: The licensing agreement will contain terms and conditions for revenue sharing and royalties, where the DAO will receive a share of the revenue generated from the commercialization of RnD efforts. The terms of revenue sharing will be proportional to the amount of RnD financing contributed by the DAO, stakeholders, or contributors.

4. Compliance: The entities that commercialize the RnD will be required to comply with all legal, regulatory, and governance requirements, standards, and guidelines, specifically those that are relevant to the product, service, or technology that the RnD efforts focused on.

5. Termination Clause: The licensing agreement will contain a termination clause, specifying how the agreement may be terminated in the event of a material breach or expiration of the term.

6. Liability and Indemnity: The licensing agreement will allocate risks between the DAO and the newly registered companies, outlining their respective rights in case of liability incidents that may arise as a result of the agreement.

7. Dispute Resolution: The licensing agreement should contain a dispute resolution clause that outlines the procedures for resolving disputes between each of the parties.

In conclusion, this framework should align the interests of both parties. It is important to caution that a proper assessment of regulatory compliance requirements and applicable jurisdictional laws should be reviewed with legal assistance during the drafting of the agreement. Additionally, it is necessary to provide updated use-case data and the establishment of methods to monitor the process regularly to ensure that the commercialization process is working and that fair compensation to all parties involved is taking place.
[4/9/23, 7:37:58 AM] Gary Teh: I posed this question 

What is the best way to generate revenue for a DAO with a purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth and the core values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity?
[4/9/23, 7:38:10 AM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Generating revenue for a DAO focused on building a better world based on verifiable truth and core values of autonomy, integrity, and diversity should align with the organization's mission and ethos. Here are some potential strategies for generating revenue:

1. Non-Profit Initiatives: Partnering with non-profit organizations focused on similar goals as the DAO could help generate revenue, through fundraising or grant applications. Revenue can also be generated through a focus on charitable goals or via donations. 

2. Digital Applications and Tools: Developing or funding applications and tools that enable the spread of truth, transparency, and equity can generate revenue for the DAO. A few examples could be building a decentralized verification platform or a truth-tracking application or a fact-checking tool.

3. Membership and Platform Fees: Offering premium access plans, subscriptions or partnerships with the DAO, or charging fees for using the platform could generate revenue for the DAO.

4. Invest in Impactful Businesses: Investing in impactful businesses and start-ups that share a common goal of spreading truth, integrity, and diversity can be a revenue-generating opportunity. By utilizing the wealth of knowledge and resources within the DAO, successful business ventures can translate into returns on investment for the DAO.

5. Sustainable and Ecological Projects: Funding eco-friendly ventures aimed at building a healthy and sustainable community aligns with the DAO's mission, and there's a potential to create revenue streams from ventures that align with these values to the benefit of the DAO.

6. Crowdfunding: Approach investors who share the DAO's goals and help support DAO growth through channels like crowdfunding platforms.

In Summary, generating revenue for a DAO focused on spreading truth, integrity and diversity may require exploratory and novel approaches. It is essential to take advantage of the DAO's community and strengths to create value and require a maintained sense of integrity and transparency in all business endeavours. With proper planning and execution, these revenue-generating strategies have the potential to ensure sustainable growth while continuing to uphold the DAO's core values.
[4/9/23, 8:02:04 AM] Gary Teh: Seems we are starting to do 1. through the list of grants we have started compiling 

Under category 2 and 3 is edgar, cypher defense and potentially Sun mint 

Under category 5 is EcoVerse21
[4/10/23, 1:49:48 PM] Gary Teh: I am receiving quite a few pitch decks a week right now. And generally don’t have much bandwidth to review them or follow up on the necessary introductions 

@5511982667030 posed me a question this weekend which I ask ChatGpt

What are the benefits a project leader can have if he brings his project to become part of a DAO? Answer in less than 100 words
[4/10/23, 1:50:13 PM] Gary Teh: The response 

A project leader can benefit from joining a DAO by accessing community resources, crowdfunding opportunities, decentralized governance, reduced operational costs, access to talent, community support and increased transparency.
[4/10/23, 1:51:17 PM] Dan: Love that response!
[4/10/23, 1:52:24 PM] Gary Teh: Seems funding is a need amongst project leaders 

I am opening up the question to community members here on how to streamline the process without really bottleneckkng through me

As @918017107841 rightfully realize once I kickstart the Sun Mint project I will mainly be offline during the facility’s construction
[4/10/23, 6:17:10 PM] Gary Teh: Posed this same question to ChatGpt 

Our DAO has the purpose of building a better world based on fundamental truth with the core values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good scalable process we could use to process all incoming requests by DAO member seeking funding support from other DAO members?
[4/10/23, 6:17:22 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

To process incoming funding requests from DAO members seeking support from other members, a good scalable process could include the following steps:

1. Set up Clear Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for members whose projects are seeking funding support, including eligibility criteria, funding limits, expected outcomes, and community involvement.

2. Verification and Validation: Verify that the proposed project aligns with the DAO's mission, vision, and values and meets the criteria set in the funding guidelines.

3. Proposal Submission: Allow members to submit their proposals and all necessary documentation online.

4. Review and Evaluation: Assign a group of expert reviewers to evaluate proposals based on specific criteria, rating them and providing feedback.

5. Presentation and Q&A: Allow project leaders to present their proposals and answer questions from the review team and the wider community.

6. Community Discussion and Feedback: Create a forum or chatroom for community members to discuss and provide feedback about the proposed projects.

7. Vote: Allow DAO community members to vote based on the proposal's details and how it aligns with the DAO's mission, vision, and values.

8. Disbursement: Disburse funding to successful projects based on the DAO's governance model and the voting outcomes.

By implementing these scalable processes, the DAO can review and finance projects that align with its core values while avoiding funding ineffective or incompatible projects. This process ensures that the DAO maintains its integrity, autonomy and inclusivity, and enables community collaboration towards realizing the DAO's vision of building a better world based on fundamental truth.
[4/10/23, 6:18:41 PM] Gary Teh: Feels like if we did a deep dive into each of the 8 points surfaced by ChatGpt and collated them onto a document we would have a complete well defined process for handling all incoming funding request by DAO members
[4/10/23, 8:39:01 PM] Anupa/diya: There are a handful group building the project now we need an active a community. If would be great of people to voice what they are thinking in terms of moving forward or changing direction
[4/10/23, 8:43:03 PM] Anupa/diya: Great ideas/ Great network of people in Tru sight 


 Cypher defense will some push can be actualized. It's ready for funding and a roll out plan.

Ecoverse . Is ready for research 

Sun mint is ready to roll 

Or do make trusight a place where newer communities create their pitch decks via tru sight Dao process,  uploads it to the community, and communities votes for it to go to the "stage" for investors to take a call.

We just built this community so they can network and build their connections.  Foster connections 

Do we have scrap this and concentrate on sun mint and building sustainability for community where sun mint will be built
[4/10/23, 8:46:59 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 Perhaps create a poll here so that members can cast their vote 🙂

What would be the immediate next step we need to undertake to get it setup?
[4/13/23, 8:55:03 AM] Vlatko Gigov: 1. Nominate legal support to draft bylaws for submission for approval of the cooperative. 
2. Fund paid in capital min ~25k/50k Chf 
3. Choose representative members 3+ … 
4. Establish bank account.

[4/13/23, 9:05:36 AM] Gary Teh: What are the immediate next steps to execute upon 1?
[4/13/23, 9:08:39 AM] Gary Teh: Can the funds paid in be immediately redeployed to fund our projects like SunMint and EcoVerse21? 

Or does it have to be a steady 25K to 50k of liquidity kept in bank regardless of asset level?
[4/13/23, 9:12:11 AM] Vlatko Gigov: It can be used once released from the temporary bank account upon registration and new bank account.

This reminds me of the scenario when Jack Ma had to fire two of Alibaba’s top sales performers for policy transgressions (by giving customer employees kickbacks)

[4/13/23, 11:19:18 AM] Gary Teh: I prompted ChatGpt to propose a first draft of our DAO’s bylaw with this prompt  

We are TrueSight DAO. Our purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity. 

Propose us a set of bylaws we could use for our incorporation as a cooperative in Switzerland
[4/13/23, 11:19:34 AM] Gary Teh: This was its response 

Sure, I can propose a set of bylaws for TrueSight DAO's incorporation as a cooperative in Switzerland, based on your stated purpose and core values. Please note that this is just an example and should be reviewed and adapted by a qualified legal professional:

ARTICLE 1 – NAME, SEAT AND PURPOSE

1.1 Name: The name of the cooperative shall be TrueSight DAO.

1.2 Seat: The seat of the cooperative shall be established in Switzerland, at a place to be determined by the board of directors.

1.3 Purpose: The purpose of the cooperative is to build a better world based on verifiable truth, powered by decentralized technologies. To this end, the cooperative seeks to promote the development, adoption and use of blockchain, smart contract, and other decentralized technologies to advance the principles of Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity.

ARTICLE 2 – MEMBERSHIP

2.1 Eligibility: Any individual or legal entity that shares the purpose and values of the cooperative may become a member by submitting a membership application and paying any required membership fees.

2.2 Members' Rights: Each member shall have one vote at general assembly meetings and shall be entitled to participate in the cooperative's activities and to benefit from its services and facilities, subject to the conditions set by the board of directors.

2.3 Members' Obligations: Members shall abide by the bylaws and decisions of the cooperative's organs, pay their membership fees and contribute to the cooperative's activities and projects, as determined by the board of directors.

2.4 Cost of Membership: The board of directors shall determine the amount of the membership fees, as well as any other fees, contributions or investments required from the members.

ARTICLE 3 – ORGANIZATION

3.1 Organs: The cooperative shall be composed of the following organs: the general assembly, the board of directors, and the auditors.

3.2 General Assembly: The general assembly shall be the highest decision-making body of the cooperative and shall meet at least once per year. It shall be composed of all members of the cooperative and shall have the power to elect and remove the members of the board of directors and the auditors, approve the bylaws and the annual report, and decide on any other matters requiring a vote by the members.

3.3 Board of Directors: The board of directors shall be composed of at least three members, elected by the general assembly for a term of three years. The board shall be responsible for the overall management and direction of the cooperative, as well as for implementing the decisions of the general assembly.

3.4 Auditors: The auditors shall be responsible for verifying the cooperative's accounts and financial statements, as well as for reporting to the general assembly on their findings.

ARTICLE 4 – DISSOLUTION

4.1 Dissolution: The cooperative may be dissolved by a decision of the general assembly, taken by a two-thirds majority of the members present. In case of dissolution, the assets of the cooperative shall be distributed to one or several non-profit organizations with similar purposes, as determined by the general assembly.

5.1 Amendments: These bylaws may be amended by a decision of the general assembly, taken by a two-thirds majority of the members present.

5.2 Legal Framework: These bylaws shall be subject to Swiss law and shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the applicable legislation.

I hope this bylaws proposal meets your needs. As mentioned earlier, it should be reviewed and adapted by a qualified legal professional before incorporating as a cooperative in Switzerland.
[4/13/23, 12:09:34 PM] Gary Teh: One more bump on this. Let’s close out this poll by this weekend
[4/14/23, 12:00:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: The problem with ChatGPT is that it is generic while we are in a more or less uncharted and highly international area where the law gets very fuzzy. When I read something like point 4. Compliance .. I wonder if anyone knows what to do then? The solution is: tailor made proper contractual arrangements, selecting carefully your partners and some tech to help with the evidence if it gets ugly. 
People take ideas if they are not protected or the law enforcement is too complicated, expensive or simply impossible. 
We would need 1. a consent in the group eg as Alessandro suggested and 2. identification of the members and 3. traceability. Still then … it can happen.
[4/14/23, 12:22:57 AM] Anupa/diya: What I can suggest is that all the relevant information that is being put in a chat. Let's add to it to a document which that then be edited
[4/14/23, 12:23:06 AM] Anupa/diya: As a the final source
[4/14/23, 12:24:47 AM] Anupa/diya: It can be done for all the active groups as eventually we can have to start accumulating the information constructively
[4/14/23, 4:33:36 AM] Gary Teh: There is this function. We could potentially feed it to with ChatGpt to get a summary of our weekly discussions. 

Or at a much later stage, extend Edgar to support large language AI model function and then feed Edgar with it to get our daily summary 

From my perspective feeding Edgar with it will be helpful not just for getting summaries. Since Edgar will primarily be feed only with data we trained it, it will become our dedicated Oracle  to answer members (new, old and prospective) any questions pertaining to our DAO

[4/14/23, 4:58:47 AM] Dr. Denis: https://www.amxlaw.com/
[4/14/23, 4:59:26 AM] Anupa/diya: The thing is that once you export the data. It normally exports who is saying what. That data ie names has to be extracted before it is feed to chatgtp. Chatgtp also says do not feed it with names and emails.

Is there any other way that we are not so dependent on chatgtp. Maybe some sort of function on the website ?
[4/14/23, 5:43:08 AM] Gary Teh: That is why I mentioned in the future we could extend Edgar with a large language model function (essentially what ChatGpt is)

Right now no other cheap and affordable way to go about it 

Unless having these summarizes is super urgent and too priority , I would suggest we hold off on it for now

The reason is because setting up such a facility…  


Option A - do our own on AWS 
1) takes up a lot of engineering effort

2) costly to maintain if using AWS infrastructure 


Option B - do on ChatGpt
1) Leads to privacy concerns


Maintaining our own infrastructure once the Sunmit off grid data center facility (initially used for mining Bitcoin) becomes viable since the infrastructure cost is just the initial sunk cost used to setup the facility
[4/14/23, 6:53:44 AM] Gary Teh: Have you had experience with them, what was the renumeration arrangement you had with them for handling your legal needs?

Let me ask @381644913030 to see if she might be able to help with this too
[4/14/23, 7:08:13 AM] Dr. Denis: Karin used to work for MME - the leading Swiss legal firm focused on crypto and then established her own legal practice. So, her services should be more affordable compared to traditional legal firms. Fabio (founder of AMX) is the legal advisor of my own crypto project. We’ve already done some work together and the service was good & readonably priced. In any case you have to talk to those lawyers in order to get a quotation for your specific case
[4/14/23, 4:26:27 PM] Gary Teh: Came up with the first draft of white papers for the following projects

After doing a deeper dive into both projects, seems SunMint and Ecoverse21 feed into each other.

This upcoming exercise reminds me of this casual conversation I had with a senior engineer back in Edmodo one day (he helped built a huge section of the Unix kernel). 

I asked him what was his Ikigai. What drives him to wake up everyday and still come to the work. His response “pay bills…”

“That’s it!?!” I replied incredulously surprised by his total honesty and thorough lack of thought on how he uses his life 😱

Well… he quit and left the company two weeks. I guess that conversation was a wake up call for him 🤣

2. members who need advisory inputs to further their personal projects will also need to start paying in DAO tokens 

3. Members who want to advertise their personal projects in any of our channels will first need to pay DAo tokens otherwise all advertisements will be automatically removed by administrators

Response 
———
Sure. 

From my perspective it is less about revenue (since no fiat changes hand during the entire process) and more about conserving precious time, attention and resource of network members.These are the property of the commons for this community. 

Everyone loves a space where they can gain access to “free” expert advisory, “free” introductions as well as a “free” channel to advertise their projects. 

The flip side is this value does not come “free” though and maybe subjected to the abuse by less mindful members in the network. 

When that occurs everyone on the receiving side end up spending their time and energy on contents/requests that are not truly aligned to their own purpose. 

This is especially true after receiving lot of feedback from members who have disengaged due to there being too much messages in the chatrooms and too much inbound requests. 

Having such policies in place will ensure some form of merit based filter on the requests passing through the network. And if it does pass through the network, recipients can be confident the requester has accumulated enough merit/good kharma in the network. 

Plus after close observation spanning close to two years, it seems less mindful members with abusive inclinations will naturally choose to leave the network after achieving their personal goals anyways. 

Having this set of policy only serves to hasten the process while minimizing the impact of their behavior on other members.

overall it is also positive to provide governors with a coherent policy to follow regarding requests that are passing through the network. 

And all these we can bake into the smart contracts on the blockchain later on and manage via UI/UX of our supporting community website. 

As suggested by @5491125130580, @918017107841 and @5511982667030, we now prepare our grounds to plant the seeds for the virtuous cycle to truly start flourishing within our community 



PS: I Will be busy preparing for the keynote I will be giving in Germany at the conference that @491736386942 has kindly organized, over the next few days. There I will be presenting the learnings of our DAO’s meta-game social experiments (basically what we are collectively engaged in right now)

Open to having a zoom call after that. 

Will send a lettuce meet link once I arrive in bogota 🙂👍

Just to clarify pertaining to a question asked earlier by @41765737357 which might be your minds as well 

No, The second option doesn’t mean you will be forced to leave the network. It is just a statement of how strongly you feel against the introduction of the proposed policies to protect member privacy, to such an extend you will exercise your right to Rage Quit. 

Rage Quitting is a common phenomena. As members of TrueSight DAO you have every right to exercise this option if you feel the direction the DAO is headed is not in alignment with your core purpose and runs contrary to your core values 🙂👍
[4/26/23, 10:11:30 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the issues raised by @5491125130580 and @918017107841 

It makes sense from a productivity perspective to have the types of required roles defined upfront for each project and when members in our DAO request to join those project groups they will undergo a separate onboarding process for each of these projects 

During the onboarding process it will become apparent whether they will be a good fit for the project’s needs and when they do finally get into those channels, it will be crystal clear how they will be expected to contribute 

There will exist this scenario where a DAO member desiring to join a project might not be admitted to it due to a lack of fit. 

Based on my observations over the past year, allowing free for all entry into project groups without proper onboarding process is a generally confusing experience for bulk of folks who have undergone the experience 

Taking a step back, I noticed even in prior organizations I am part there exist only around 2.5% to 5% of the population are comfortable navigating unstructured and uncertain environments. The rest of the 95% just curl up in confusion feeling totally lost. These latter folks will need some form of structure in place before they can be let in.

[4/26/23, 10:42:25 AM] Gary Teh: I would like to propose during the [test] phase only these roles be made available and only members who can fill these roles be allowed into the channels after a round of review 

1. subject matter experts 
2. Facilitator 
3. Business analyst  

That way discussions not be sidetracked by off topic distractions

[4/26/23, 10:44:05 AM] Tomas - Offchain: how the validation will work?
[4/26/23, 10:44:16 AM] Gary Teh: What do you mean?
[4/26/23, 5:21:49 PM] Tomas - Offchain: The business analyst will do the validation of the business from point to point? Just trying to understand a little bit how it will work
[4/26/23, 5:24:06 PM] Gary Teh: The business analyst will help fill up the business model canvas which means during the process checking to make sure the nuts and bolts fit correctly
[4/26/23, 5:56:30 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/26/23, 5:59:10 PM] Gary Teh: The business analyst is more an inner facing role, managing and directing the efforts of all the internal folks operating within the scope of the project.

The facilitator is more an external facing role. Helping recruit for roles into these projects when the open up. Also the facilitator will have the task of facilitate the transition of project members out of the scope once the project has grown beyond the phase where the skill set is of direct relevance 

The business analyst will work with the facilitator to define the newly required roles as and when needed
[4/26/23, 6:09:29 PM] Gary Teh: I noticed while overseeing various projects over the past year that members will try to surface business ideas within the scopes, however when requested to practice the full discipline of filling out the business model canvas, it came to my attention bulk of them do not have the necessary business background training to even think in terms of profit and losses statements much less fill up a full business model canvas which assumes an underlying profit and loss statement. The ideas they surface when examined critically are generally piecemeal and not useful. 

After collecting a year’s worth of data, my conclusion is the right profile to drive a project forward should at least be someone who has had some training in business, financial accounting or had built and ran a revenue generating startup. 

As for the other folks, their skill set lies elsewhere, some in graphics, others in engineering, others in gaining followers and driving eyeballs, others in writing compelling articles, others in simply just being likable thus having relationships with a lot of people in influential positions. Others in building rock solid software systems

rather than set them up for failure by forcing them to operate in areas they are weak at, we should tap into their strengths by correctly profiling them and only introducing them into the projects when these projects reach the stage where their skill sets become directly applicable. Meanwhile the facilitator should keep everybody posted on the progress of various projects
[4/26/23, 6:13:31 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Sounds like a good test to make
[4/26/23, 6:15:38 PM] Gary Teh: The structure within the project is more centralized than I would want. But the trade off of having too decentralized an operating model with the scope of the project is a waste of everybody’s precious time and resources 

So we have tested a full decentralized approach the whole of last year.

Now let’s scale it back and attempt a semi-centralized structure within the scope of projects
[4/26/23, 6:17:34 PM] Gary Teh: That said. Quick bump
[4/26/23, 6:17:50 PM] Gary Teh: And another bump to this too
[4/27/23, 8:38:33 AM] Gary Teh: Seems our collective stance has became unanimously apparent. While we wait for it to close out, I see two approaches in determining the amount of DAO tokens to be charged for scenarios 1 (request for introduction) and 2 (expert advisory). 

Approach 1: Charges will be calculated based on total token holdings of DAO member who has been approached to make introduction or provide expert advisory.

The formula will be [Total Member Token Holdings] X 10% / 80%

If requesting for expert advisory or introduction from a member who has 30K tokens the total amount of tokens the requester will need to pay is 3750 tokens

The member providing the advisory or introduction will receive 3000 tokens while 750 tokens will be returned to our DAO's vault thereby removed from circulation.

The advantage of this approach is that members seeking to access this utility will be mindful on whom they approach for their request especially members with a high standing in our community and only quality request pass through the network. 

Approach 2: Charges will be calculated based on corresponding amount in our rubric / 80%

If requesting for an introduction in an investor from a member our rubric indicates this action is worth 50 tokens. So the total amount of tokens to be charged to the requestor will be 62.5 tokens. 

The member making the introduction will receive 50 tokens, while 12.5 tokens is returned to our vault and removed from circulation. 

The advantage of this approach is that the utility is more accessible to members who need introductions. The drawback is our network might get flooded with a lot of requests and members will start experiencing request fatigue again. 

Let's get a quick sense of which direction our community is inclined towards
[4/27/23, 8:40:21 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
How shall we calculate the amount of tokens to charge for these side benefits of introduction and expert advisory?

- what assumptions of the world we are trying to prove 
- our operating structure
- ground rules 🙂👍

[5/2/23, 7:54:07 AM] Tiff Tiff: Thank you!
[5/2/23, 7:55:08 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the decision on our guild onboarding policy is now apparent 

We have revised the white papers for both EcoVerse21 and Sunmint guilds

The financing structure and the operating roles are defined therein 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper

https://truesight.me/dao/sunmint/whitepaper

The raising of fiat financing will be done via NFT sales issued by their respective guilds 

The benefit of holding these NFTs is reaping the recurring profit yields generated from the underlying business activities within these guilds 

DAO members who want to earn returns through their efforts can continue to contribute work in exchange for DAO governance tokens within the scope of these guilds. 

The value of these governance tokens issued are backed by the 20% carry the guilds impose on the recurring profits generated by these business activities.

[5/2/23, 8:39:48 AM] Gary Teh: I think this two tier model should cleanly demarcate the fiat funds injected by investors into various projects operated by our guilds and the governance tokens issued to DAO members in exchange for their time, effort and social capital contributions

The two key concerns we address are

1) how to raise external fiat funds while preventing purely profit focused and non-value aligned crypto whales (high networth individuals) from simply buying their way into our DAO governance tokens and compromising our DNA with the outsized voting weight they end up having through their raw purchasing power

2) the immediate dilutive effective whales experience on their capital when it gets injected directly via our governance tokens route. Buying at USD1 per governance token while cashing out from our DAO’s treasury at the current rate of USD0.0033 per governance token

[5/6/23, 7:12:51 AM] Gary Teh: Encountered this situation yesterday when I somehow ended up sharing about our DAO to an entire table of speakers at the cryptocurrency conference. 

They were all asking how to join the DAO. 

From my perspective rather than just lumping them all into the beer hall which is really a poor onboarding experience, it makes sense to have them just leave their email address on a waitlist along with their reason for interest and what skill sets they have 

That way we will selectively onboard them as and when roles open up that fit their skillset and motivation

The population growth rate of our DAO might end up being slower but the immediate engagement for newly onboarded members will be higher since the openings will be directly relevant and motivations aligned

This is aligned with what @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @5511982667030 have suggested 🙂👍
[5/6/23, 7:14:29 AM] Gary Teh: In essence, we end up extending this policy to cover DAO entry as well.

[5/9/23, 3:31:52 PM] Gary Teh: We have managed to achieve a significant milestone today within the EcoVerse21 guild today by gaining full visibility into the end to end cost components required to finance the very first shipment of premium cacao from small-scale marginalized farmers in South America for resale to North American consumers. 

At a high level, the amount of assets within our treasury will be more than enough to cover all the required costing

Once the final figures are in, we should be expecting to hold a vote in treasury to release the assets required for its execution.

Executed successfully we should be expecting a significant jump in the assets under control in our treasury while benefiting these small scale marginalized farming communities 

We can then expect to continue ramping up the asset under control in our treasury via this route for the foreseeable future until market saturation in Northern America or until production capacity is achieved within these small scale farming communities.

We can then start expanding our guilds operations to support other communities that are focused on other agricultural produce.
[5/9/23, 3:45:18 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/9/23, 3:46:23 PM] Gary Teh: Another key insight gained this week is that a lot of these small scale farms are ran by the aging elders. 

Their offsprings attracted by the allure of cities are opting instead to move to big cities seeking out minimum wage jobs. 

The younger generations once their parents choose to retire will opt to sell of these farms. 

This trend naturally segways into our sunmint project where we can opt to acquire these productive assets during such events.
[5/9/23, 3:48:22 PM] Gary Teh: It’s quite similar to the policy adopted by AirBnb when they transitioned into the period during the pandemic

And here is why I am doing it. Some folks are too shy to leave a channel even though they know they can't really contribute within those channels. And meanwhile they are feeling agonized everyday when they see their phones being bombed with messages. 

If you believe you were wrongly booted from a channel please kindly request for re-entry. Please note that new policies are now in effect where applicable for re-entry into those [ops] channels (aka signed NDA and noncompete forms).
[5/10/23, 1:30:25 PM] Gary Teh: Another clear signal which we will utilize to gently extend the invitation for a member to leave the [ops] channels is when we noticed a member hasn't visited it for more than consecutive 30 days.

Right now what I observe is bulk of the solutions skirt pass the heavy lifting of tackling the legal, marketing and logistic hurdles. 

This leaves huge room for arbitrage and exploitation of producers and end consumers by middle men (the ones who tackled these hurdles by building a bridge and then charging a toll for its use with the goal of profit maximization ).

We build a bridge too. But with the goal of ironing out the asymmetry within the system. first we become the middle man and then from there we expand our bridge. 

Eventually we replace the bridges setup by other middle men.

I am aware there are members who are familiar with other trade routes and product types. 

We will reinvite them back into the guild once we have done a few iterations of transactions and are ready to expand to either more territories or product types. 

Meanwhile as we go through the current two iterations as and when there are other needs within the guild we will reach out to bring more members who fit the profile into the project🙂🙏

‎OPTION: Texas (1 vote)
[5/17/23, 11:00:38 AM] Gary Teh: This is what ChatGpt has advised after being queried

Delaware: Delaware is a popular choice for incorporating businesses due to its well-established corporate law structure, business-friendly regulations, and specialized courts, such as the Court of Chancery, which handles corporate disputes. Delaware offers favorable tax laws for businesses and has a strong legal framework that provides clarity and predictability.

Nevada: Nevada is known for its business-friendly environment, including minimal reporting requirements, no state corporate income tax, and no personal income tax. It also provides strong asset protection laws, making it an attractive option for businesses.

Wyoming: Wyoming is another state with business-friendly regulations and low taxes. It offers advantages such as no state corporate income tax, low annual fees, strong privacy protections, and a simplified reporting process.

New Mexico: New Mexico is gaining popularity as a favorable state for LLC incorporation due to its low filing fees, no franchise tax, and a straightforward business formation process. It also offers a business-friendly environment and favorable tax laws.

Texas: Texas is known for its pro-business environment and has no personal income tax or state corporate income tax. It offers a favorable regulatory climate, access to a large market, and a strong economy.
[5/17/23, 11:23:12 AM] Tres Garcia: Can we take a quick inventory on the count of US and Foreign peeps that will be involved with the LLC?

Missing deadlines and not documenting non us owners will result in heafty fines for Delaware based co / LLC

Not sure how they view tokenization if it infers ownership of the Entity. 

TX has no tax as long as the DAO is under $1M in rev.

[5/17/23, 11:40:35 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking if all the token holders should even be listed as directors or shareholders of the US based LLC. 
Perhaps only a subset of those actively involved in the guild.

I think the bulk of the financial plumbing work would be to figure out how the funds provided by the DAO to finance the shipment will be channeled back to it after the sales of the shipment is completed. And have it cleanly accounted for in the guild's LLC.

To keep things simple, perhaps to only have US based DAO members who plan to be really hands on and involved with the Ecoverse21 guild listed as directors of the LLC. 

Right now based on what I am observing that would only be me and @13134136108, unless some other US based members are willing to stepup.
[5/17/23, 11:42:32 AM] Gary Teh: We have found our customs broker and FDA representative. The next step is to figure out our LLC entity. Once that is done, the rest will just start flowing really smoothly.

Should the agent handling the funds decides to abscond with it, then our DAO would have experienced our very first rug pull. 😱
‎[5/17/23, 1:10:56 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎<attached: 00000296-GIF-2023-05-17-13-10-56.mp4>
[5/17/23, 1:36:19 PM] Gary Teh: Since I will be the person handling the funds and overseeing the shipment transaction once it is OffChain, I will sign a copy of this agency agreement 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ZgY2Q18Ftw8B-yQlAbQhXwI3Dk_qCDbQgCbWuvwGa4/edit

That should help protect the DAO against a rug pull. 

We should probably modify the terms alittle to TrueTech Inc undertake the rectification in case I rug pull
[5/17/23, 2:31:47 PM] Tess walkowski: A constellation of llcs!
[5/17/23, 2:34:50 PM] Tess walkowski: So in general the way token holders succeed is my the tokens of trusight dao going up in value as we succeed?
[5/17/23, 2:35:33 PM] Tess walkowski: And then the profits are channeled back into the fund to be used for other projects?
[5/17/23, 2:36:51 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.
[5/17/23, 3:23:34 PM] Gary Teh: That is correct. 🙂👍
[5/17/23, 3:23:52 PM] Gary Teh: And that too is correct
[5/18/23, 5:03:46 AM] Gary Teh: This is a great approach

This is how I am thinking of accounting for the flow of funds 

Whenever there is an incoming shipment the financing the DAO provides to the LLC is recorded as a personal loan on the balance sheet. 

Once transaction is finished loan amount is returned and the amount removed from the balance sheet

Profit (less taxes) is then used to purchased governance tokens from our DAO’s vault at the rate of USD1 to 1 governance token by the LLC. 

The side-effect though is the LLC end up accumulating a lot of voting power in our DAO overtime.

Anyone has a better idea?
[5/18/23, 6:21:01 AM] Tess walkowski: Is there a way to make a smart contract for this.
[5/18/23, 6:29:13 AM] Gary Teh: Pretty hard at this point still

Since a lot of the activities happen off line
[5/18/23, 6:50:31 AM] Tess walkowski: I have trust in this situation but we want to avoid setting ourselves up for future rugs or attacks
[5/18/23, 6:52:51 AM] Suheil z: we can create internal token attaching to it all offline material such as legal agreements ect ect usiing tokentool.bitbond.com easy

[5/18/23, 7:48:14 AM] Gary Teh: We can consider exploring that more deeply once we have proven the viability of shipment #1 and shipment #2

This should be addressed once the Swiss entity is setup that acts as the custodian for the governance tokens and the assets sitting in the vault, we should be able to resolve this. And we can then update Ecoverse21's white paper with the new fund management protocol

[5/18/23, 3:09:13 PM] Gary Teh: Actually anything more than 8 people in a guild becomes counter productive 

I am proposing once a guild reaches capacity 8 if a new member is to be added to a guild, the next least relevant existing person in the guild should be disinvited
[5/18/23, 3:09:56 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Impose 8 member capacity in guild
‎OPTION: Yes! Less communication overhead and distraction (5 votes)
‎OPTION: No! That is so strict!! (1 vote)
[5/18/23, 3:27:44 PM] Suheil z: i would vote yes to begin with as we don't have efficient tools yet to manage better with more... inshalla soon we will and then i would re change my answer to so strict. 2 rule pizza came within web2 era, we are here to upgrade :D

[6/12/23, 5:52:43 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Your preferred structure for Agroverse (AGS) and fiat capital injection for it via TrueTech Inc (TTI)?
‎OPTION: TTI as holding bay for $. Governance tokens issued to TTI for expenses paid 4 AGI. AGI stays in DAO (2 votes)
‎OPTION: TTI as independent subsidiary running AGI. TTI shares issued to Swiss Association 4 DAO contrbutns (1 vote)
‎OPTION: TTI as independent subsidiary running AGI. TTI shares issued to investmnt syndicate 4 DAO contribtns (1 vote)
[6/12/23, 5:59:32 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/12/23, 6:03:58 AM] Gary Teh: Side note: Folks who opt for option 2 are basically also volunteering to help setup the Swiss association that will be TrueSight DAO’s legal wrapper. 

Option 2 and 3 assumes Agroverse will be a brand under TrueTech Inc and TrueTech Inc is getting structured as a spin off and TrueSight DAO is one of the early investors in the Agroverse project. This route allows us seek capital raise via traditional financing methods (Angels, VCs…) once our initial pilot test proves successful. A whole bunch of full time staff will then be hired to operate the project thereafter.
[6/12/23, 6:15:41 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/12/23, 6:18:20 AM] Gary Teh: Option 1 assumes profit generated via Agroverse operations will get channeled back to TrueSight DAO to back governance tokens value and provide liquidity as and when DAO member wishes to cash out the governance tokens for fiat or when new project passing through our DAO requires resource backing. 

Option 2 and 3 assumes profit generated within TrueTech Inc will continue to stay within company for continued business operations and scaling. Value of governance tokens will be backed by shares in TrueTech Inc. There will be no liquidity for governance tokens until such a liquidity event such as TrueTech Inc gets acquired or goes for IPO. New projects passing through TrueSight DAO that requires resource backing will not benefit from the liquidity sitting within TrueTech Inc.
[6/12/23, 8:00:55 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Wouldn´t it be good to have some discussions on the topic before doing the pool (it might get more insights having that in the process)

Checking with @18298364965 now to figure out when he might be available to head over there together. In worst case scenario (his day to day schedule operating the hotel is very demanding), I will figure out the logistics to get there

    - @972543523823 has came up with a draft of our package design. She is now modifying the designs to fit the required physical dimensions 

    - I have acquired enough information to draft up the financials for our first 100KG pilot test as well as the economics for each 1000KG of cacao shipment.


Main DAO

    - had a chat with @33652866472 today. The folks from Peace on Snow Associations have responded. Apparently Hans Martin whom I visited during my recent trip to Switzerland is one of the founding members. I have since started the conversation with them.

    - there is right now an ongoing private side discussions about a new potential project amongst various DAO members that is focused on addressing the social injustice within the hospitality industry. Discussion are still in the early stages to figure out which partners fit where and how TrueSight DAO might fit in. We will be deliberate and proceed with care so as to avoid committing the same mistake we did with Peter Peng. 

Peter Peng (an ex-member booted from our eco-system) came into our DAO, utilized our collective brain cycles to help refine his AI idea thereafter claimed it fully as his own. Renumeration for usage brain cycles within our DAO was not properly accounted for. Brain cycles of DAO members were consumed but in exchange there were no boost to the net book value of our governance tokens. 🤔

Some of the RnD I observe done at the grassroot level is just amazing. The other day, me and @18298364965 had the opportunity to taste wine made from Cacao! It tasted like elixir. 

From my perspective, that will be one of the very very next SKUs, we want to carry once the organic cacao nibs and ceremonial cacao trade routes have been established.

Well done Gary. 

But I don’t really get it. It’s coco nibs. It’s organic. It’s everywhere in my supermarket. 

So what’s the unique selling point?
[6/23/23, 5:11:32 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: give me more info for the Swiss association

[6/23/23, 5:31:19 PM] Gary Teh: During my meeting with @12023686334 yesterday. It seems if you just look at the product itself, it's technically just a generic commodity.

But as @573136732781 has just shared and @41765737357 has emphasized over and over again during our conversations, the pandemic has caused a shift in consumer attitude.

They are looking increasingly beyond the commodity aspects of a product they consume on a daily basis. Increasingly they are concern about the story behind the product. 

- are the people who produced the product being treated fairly?
- what are the day to day struggles the people producing the product face (climate change impact)?
- Is the process used to produce the product environmentally sustainable?
[6/23/23, 5:34:50 PM] Gary Teh: If the proposal gets adopted, then the current set of governors (past 90 top 10 contributors in our DAO) being nominated by our system will be asked if they are able and willing to contributed at the level required as documented in the proposal.

For those that are not, we will source for people who are able to contribute at the required capacity in the following order as nominated by our system

    - 180 days top 10 contributors
    - 360 days top 10 contributors
    - all time top 10 contributors

[6/23/23, 5:38:06 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: easy and not that expensive to show this story whit a professional vidomaker in the social media marketing in the right market whit high visibility, maybe whit a present in a special  day like the day of the heart, san Valentinos day,christmas and bla bra. Everything connected whit a good brand design and a good shipping Amazon fba selling mode over then the sell in the normal market.
[6/23/23, 5:39:46 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Using Amazon FBA selling model and then sell in the normal market is the same order that both @31641075825 and @12023686334 proposed.
[6/23/23, 5:42:49 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: ye the unicity will be a mix from brand design and quality of the product.
[6/23/23, 5:44:45 PM] Gary Teh: Yes, the quality control process is so important. So is the process of telling and spreading the brand story
[6/23/23, 6:10:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: My chime in is this. 

For you to launch a common product which in my supermarkets has many organic sources. Their labels probably will have sustainable type writing. 

You are basically selling the STORY. 

So hence from a sales person perspective. 

Your focus needs to be finding ambassadors to sell story. Some sort of viral marketing. Some sort of influencer thingy. 

Don’t expect to slap on sustainable, ESG. Organic Some farmer story on a label and expect it to sell. 

Unless your price is cheapest amongst all the organic items. 

Unless there is distinct taste advantage. 

Otherwise. You will get initial sales for the novelty. Then it will fizzle out. 

These days. The market is too saturated with the word Organic. Home grown. Local farmers. It’s been overused and consumers are very numb to it.
[6/23/23, 6:12:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hence in sort. If you do not have a superior taste difference. Or price difference. 

Concentrate on marketing the story. Not the product.
[6/23/23, 6:12:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Short*
[6/23/23, 6:13:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Do a world’s first DAO created sustainability product
[6/23/23, 6:13:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: Use the DAO itself to create hype
[6/23/23, 6:13:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: Showcase the product born of collaboration
[6/23/23, 6:14:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: Sell it to the world that it bypasses all the red tapes of the world. Down with big corp ripping off farmer profits.
[6/23/23, 6:15:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tell the world farmers get directly tokens and hence product sales directly raises income of the farmers. 

Then set ablaze a decentralised farmer movement. 

If it takes off. You can create a branding for it
[6/23/23, 6:16:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Those points below. Sorry it won’t appeal to the vast population.
[6/23/23, 6:17:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: I don’t care much about it. But beating the big corporations. Dao cooperation. Crypto. And so on. You can tap it on a different market segment.
[6/23/23, 7:51:50 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : These áre valid points.
[6/23/23, 7:57:53 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : The farmers connect with each other....our goals áre in líne with what You discuss. Maybe considering adding dao to branding Even on Amazon is a valid point.

[6/25/23, 1:10:26 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Direct is exclusive.     My own strategy differs from the dao.    We choose amazon as a means to an end

[6/25/23, 5:52:38 PM] Gary Teh: The signals from what I gather when conversing privately with long time contributors like @16468233438 @5511982667030 @18175503434 @6596983014 @6594897484 and @48606646246, is that ideally we arrive at something tangible. Tangible means tokens they acquired via their contributions could sooner rather than later be exchanged for resources that could be used to feed their families. 

Be at peace that I am very well aware of these needs various DAO members with differing financial background have when assessing the various opportunities that come our way and helping prioritize as according.

[6/26/23, 5:24:42 AM] Suheil - Europe: Hypothetically speaking ethereum foundation are best team

But it all depends on who will be willing to on board us with best terms
[6/26/23, 5:25:26 AM] Suheil - Europe: Eth foundation became to big to have their attention for any special need

And I know de facto that they are small team and barely have the time to focus on anything new
[6/26/23, 5:25:42 AM] Suheil - Europe: The eth foundation core team traveling the world are barely 10 personnel lol
[6/26/23, 5:26:31 AM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: not more different in tezos
[6/26/23, 5:26:40 AM] Jonathan: The question is what needs to be onchain? If not much ethereum is good but the fees will kill the business if a lot of transactions going on
[6/26/23, 5:29:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: All are like this . They are seeking high volumes and care the less about low quality volume

[6/26/23, 6:35:14 AM] Gary Teh: Here are a few recurring transactions I have in mind

Main DAO
———
- Voting and management of treasury funds 

- Issue of governance tokens from our vault for contributions made by DAO members


Agroverse
——
- [potential] DAO member submits shipment financing request by providing all necessary details including wallet address of the human agent who will be handling the transaction offline 

- [potential] DAO votes to determine if shipment financing request should pass and minting of Agroverse shipment NFTs  for this shipment financing request enabled


- [potential] issue and minting of Agroverse Shipment NFTs to finance shipment of cargos to USA for sale by interested supporters

- [potential] DAO voting to determine how many percent of Agroverse profit proceeds should go to Agroverse shipment NFT holders 

- [potential] DAO voting to determine how many percent of Agroverse profit proceeds should go to DAO treasury

- [potential] Agroverse shipment NFT holders to vote on how many percent of their profit proceeds should be channeled to farmers the shipment was sourced from 



The bulk of the transactions for the Main DAO will be via the vault solution that already exist 


The entirety of the transactions for the Agroverse transactions will be encapsulated in the DApp that folks at the hackathon Suheil will be organizing will be building
[6/26/23, 6:39:17 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective all these are just really interim bootstrapping solutions 

once volume gets larger for the shipments we will just migrate all these to our own chain - TrueChain

TrueChain is going to be EVM compatible 

And the miners/validators will be mainly ran by the farmers/cooperatives. Bulk of them already utilize solar panels to power the facilities 

This will provide them with an additional source of revenue (in the form of gas fees) to tide through times when harvest are negatively impacted by climate

[6/26/23, 6:44:54 AM] Jonathan: Definitely not good for ether. Maybe just a layer 2. If your are willing to look at icp I can ask them if this is a fit for a grant
[6/26/23, 6:45:19 AM] Jonathan: Sure you are great at filling out grant applications
[6/26/23, 6:49:44 AM] Gary Teh: Will be happy to have a look. Also will defer to the overall voting of our DAO.

[6/26/23, 7:39:49 AM] Gary Teh: The reason we are conducting this exercise is because there will be an upcoming vote happening directly on our vault to release USD850 to @12023686334 

USD600 will be utilized by @12023686334 to pay for the USA Trade Mark Registration for Agroverse. We will need to registration ID before Amazon will unlock our Amazon Seller Profile page

USD250 will be utilized by @12023686334 to procure GS1 barcodes which we will need visible on our packaging and transportation boxes when they arrive in the USA

This is the location of our vault in case you are keen to have a look

[6/26/23, 9:27:41 AM] Tres Garcia: Is there a TLDR for why you want to change layer 1?

SOL = fastest and cheapest. 
ETH = dependable but expensive. 

If agroverse is recording transactions. It may become too expensive to record on ETH vs sol.
[6/26/23, 9:28:39 AM] Tres Garcia: You will need a layer 2 to manage bulk transactions (polygon / MATIC). So just stick with the dater layer 1

[6/26/23, 10:38:24 AM] Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli: ‎Suheil - Europe added Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli
[6/26/23, 1:54:31 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, it’s mainly where the critical mass of blockchain developers are and where the liquidity is aggregated around 

The qualitative signal I am getting from @41799155602 and @31641075825 is that energy level of the people behind this chain is waning. This could infer that population growth rates of developer in that ecosystem will likely stagnate if not drop. Feel free to counter me

Meanwhile seems EVM variants are increasingly gaining more and more critical mass

Liquidity wise, if Agroverse is going to allow the minting of Shipment financing NFTs it makes sense to utilize the chain that had the most liquidity. Hence my thoughts of utilizing Ethereum chain and Tezos chain for that. 

(If we do go down the route of the shipment financing NFTs for Agroverse) Since the funds generated from their minting is not going to be staying onchain but actually utilized Off Chain, the actual smart contracts of blockchain is not really useful. 

What we will really end up needing is an actual legal contract based in the USA that states the person receiving the funds generated via the minting actually go ahead and execute what is promised off line (take the money to pay the cooperatives and vendors to get the shipment into the USA for sale) otherwise get sued by our legal entity in USA. The big question is is that even legally enforceable in the USA courts
[6/26/23, 1:55:37 PM] Suheil - Europe: I just initiated contacts with tezoz tonight to on board them to the factory project
[6/26/23, 1:55:43 PM] Suheil - Europe: To clarify
[6/26/23, 1:55:54 PM] Suheil - Europe: The Paris factory event is a seed to create a butterfly
[6/26/23, 1:56:36 PM] Gary Teh: Failing that then we can really only rely on the legal registered officers of the US legal entity or a member of high standing in our DaO to handle the money off chain
[6/26/23, 3:34:51 PM] Tres Garcia: Solana is stagnate and developers are going elsewhere? Source of info 🙏 please.
[6/26/23, 3:35:35 PM] Gary Teh: Hunch. That is why I stated I might be wrong

[6/26/23, 3:56:43 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/26/23, 4:09:53 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is if both @41799155602 and @31641075825 reached out to them and they both got ignored then I doubt the other developers in the ecosystem would have any better experience dealing with them. And it’s not like @41799155602 and @31641075825 are nobodies in the ecosystem. 

@41799155602 literally sits on the satoshi round table

And until now our exchange rate pair submitted to serum is not even listed

Last time when I was in Germany at the conference that @491736386942 organized and mentioned this problem to the Solana folks there they just shrugged their shoulders and said they can’t do anything about it

How much retention do you think a generally centralized chain like theirs can have on the developers if the user experience is just shit. 🤔
[6/26/23, 4:52:42 PM] Gary Teh: And then you take a step back and objectively observe the second order dynamic that is playing out right now in our DAO because of the three first order interactions 3 DAO members have, and if extrapolate this pattern to what is potentially playing out in other communities right now regarding Solana, can’t that be inferred as a negative virality and thus negative network effect playing out which could potentially lead to accelerate churn in the ecosystem? 🤔

I wonder if they are already familiar with such arrangements 

How much are you thinking of if that facility with them is available?
[6/28/23, 4:43:54 PM] Vlatko Gigov: At some stage we definitely should. It will cost us/them a fraction to bank on the upside and protect the downside. 

I doubt they are familiar, but I’m sure their chain of clients are.

[6/28/23, 7:47:19 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: here for all us guis lets do it!
[6/28/23, 7:53:15 PM] Gary Teh: I observed that folks undertaking tasks will on occasions be caught up and occupied with other matters in their personal life and work life. We are a DAO and Autonomy is one of our core values. Contribution is strictly voluntary. This phenomena should be embraced. 

However the downside effect is visibility on when something gets completed is non-existent. Members undertaking tasks further down the critical path gets blocked. Dysfunction starts spreading across our entire DAO. Members start getting frustrated and churning.

I was discussing this issue with @5511982667030 just now during our facetime. She proposed that we adopt this protocol, which makes a lot of sense to me. 

Here is how it works:
----
When a DAO member decides to undertake a certain tasks, the DAO member must clearly state deadline beyond which the item will get delivered. And if no deadline is clearly stated, guild leader should prompt DAO member for one before undertaking is allowed to begin. 

In the event, task is delivered before deadline, tasks comes to an end.

Should task not be delivered when deadline arrives, DAO member can either self declare a new deadline or if not, the guild leader will reach out to get a new commitment from DAO member. 

DAO member can also choose to indicate that he/she has decided to abandon the task, at which point the tasks is freed up for undertaking by other DAO members.

Should DAO member not respond when prompted for a deadline by which to commit to, it will be assumed by default DAO member has abandoned tasks with a 48 hour period. Guild leader or other DAO members can have tasks reassigned.

I don t have no one doubt.
And i think every one here see the same 🤝
Just Let them breth after the first ship you ll see them back and ready 🤝
[6/28/23, 8:35:24 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: since you want to put in guild masters who push people to a job deadline
rather have guild masters writing possible jobs and opening entries
the first one who proposes has the job and will certainly complete it because he wants tokens
this leads to competition and more attention in the group
seeing what you want to do and a selection of the best and still need hard working people
[6/28/23, 8:36:22 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: this is my idea what you all think?

We still need help with finding participants for the focus group

Right now from my perspective it’s a big if that we can successfully find these participants.
[6/30/23, 6:39:16 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Defining that and the target group
[6/30/23, 6:43:44 AM] Gary Teh: That part is quite easy. I have been generally relying on ChatGpt for those recently

Compared to the decentralized approach, ChatGpt is able to provide a really well rounded 360 degree perspective when making suggestions 

Also it allows you to easily deep dive into specific areas where you need clarifications. 

Articulation of concept wise I think ChatGpt has already outperform a lot of humans I interacted with

It’s generally the offline aspects that we still need alot of help with

    - Identified new blockers on our critical path - we need a new consumer facing website built for our product before Amazon will ungate the groceries and gourmet product category ( https://truesight.me/dao/agroverse/progress )
    - Created a draft of the exclusive distribution rights agreement for our collaboration with Coopercabruca since they do not already have an FDA agent to represent them which will be required before their products can enter into USA (https://docs.google.com/document/d/17RAwFlYzfFRDHv7e2O118npZr796UyEz9Jeaa2Bh5qw/edit)

[7/5/23, 1:07:30 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished our 1 hour meeting between myself and @5511982667030 to discuss about how we will pursue the next steps with the exclusive distribution rights agreement with the Brazilian Cooperative 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o3y4D3Ty8pXcLdaon4fZv41Fy6KYBUHP4EcYpEHESq8/edit?usp=sharing

Next steps, @5511982667030 will be helping arrange a facetime session with the Bahia cooperative president to further solidify our relationships with them. 

Will follow @5511982667030 in this regard since she is more familiar with the way of the Brazilian culture.

[7/5/23, 1:10:16 PM] Gary Teh: Had a chat with @12023686334 this morning. Makes better sense to have the fees for USD850 we will be paying for Trade Mark registration and GS1 barcode registration transferred to me instead, since we will be incurring recurring fees and I will be filing my credit card in those accounts. 

Will grant him access to those accounts (TradeMark registration and GS1 barcode) once they are setup so that he could go ahead to help with the process
[7/5/23, 1:10:17 PM] Gary Teh: This is the updated proposal

[7/6/23, 1:06:40 PM] Gary Teh: Voting is now available for governance token holders to indicate their preferred rate. 

A DAO wide standard rate is computed based on preferred rates submitted. It indicates the transaction fee that will be applied to transactions made across our network of businesses. 

https://truesight.me/dao/preferred-rate

Right now, it is applicable for the following use cases:

    - markup on cost of goods for the cacao supplies which we will be selling to @573136732781which she will need for her cacao ceremonies

    - transactions fees we will be charging on the interest rate for facilitating a business loan proposal bearing a 12% interest that @554792626338 is right now surfacing for discussions in the governance channel

    - percentage of the net profit we will set aside for ourselves for each shipment sold via Amazon by our DAO to back the value of our governance token for each new shipment of cacao if the shipment is fully financed by us (the rest of which will be set aside as an budget to support ESG initiatives proposed by the Cooperatives)

    - percentage of the net profit we will set aside for ourselves for each shipment sold via Amazon by our DAO to back the value of our governance token for each new shipment of cacao if the shipment is fully financed by a third party financier via the Shipment financing NFT
[7/6/23, 1:11:28 PM] Gary Teh: Do note that if you submitted your preferred rate using an email address that is not registered with us, your submission will be automatically ignored when calculating our DAO wide standard rate

There after we will obtain final quotation of pricing from both sources 

With these information at had we will have a final decision of which one we will prioritize for our initial shipment

[7/9/23, 11:21:15 AM] Gary Teh: It is clear that we will be pursuing a direct to consumer distribution model with our packaged products via our Agroverse project.

As initially suggested by @12023686334, we should also consider a distribution model for unpackaged raw materials to retailers who will repackage it for their own end consumers. @573136732781 from my perspective falls squarely into that demographic 

Profit margin for our DAO will be lower for the second distribution model but inventory holding cost and distribution cost we incur will be also lower. 

I suggest we have a poll to decide whether we should support this second distribution model for unsolicited retailers who approach us directly.

[7/15/23, 9:54:32 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the underlying signal surfaced via all the incoming messages from the following DAO members over these past few weeks regarding the Agroverse project

@6590995199 @16468233438 @5511982667030 @573136732781 @12023686334 

The signals are all pointing in the same direction. Now that we can cleared off a huge portion of the ambiguity associated with the legal and logistic aspects of the project, conducting a focus group with our primary target audience (people consuming cacao nibs for their keto diet) becomes absolutely critical.

Amongst other things, one of the key insights I am hoping to glean from the focus group is to figure out how strongly these folks actually care about environmental sustainability. Quantitative signals I have gathered so far via analysis of Amazon reviews just seems to signal self interest as the main driver for sales as opposed to human altruism.

And here is where I see the divide. Internally amongst members of our DAO, altruism seems to be a recurring theme occupying a significant bandwidth of whats being discussed. Honestly, I doubt much of the folks here in this channel would really buy and consume cacao on a regular basis just because you want to be a responsible global citizen. 

So folks contributing to help build the Agroverse project and folks who end up consuming the cacao products really belong to two very different and distinct demographics.

[7/16/23, 5:30:34 AM] Gary Teh: Honestly speaking, even when I taste tested the roasted poultry my parents’ business have been distributing in Singapore for around 4 decades, the differences between their product and their competitors product as well as all the others I came across when I was traveling the world, the difference are so slight you can’t really tell the difference as a regular consumer with generally undeveloped taste buds. Of course there were some that were so bad I literally just walk out of the restaurant after sampling a few pieces. 

The same thing is true for all the sushi and ramen restaurants I have been sample around the world.

It’s just mind boggling how parent’s business managed to survive and remain one of the three companies standing in that small market place in Clementi Singapore which started with 23 competing stores after 40 years.

Mum was saying she did a lot of RnD on their original recipe by taste testing all the produce of the competitors around the entire Singapore on the weekends while they were not working. 

Dad was saying how they build relationships with the random folks walking pass their stores in the market place over time. Some of these consumers eventually turned into corporate customers. And these companies kept on with their recurring orders even years after his retirement 

One key insight he gave was that customer of another brand will only consider a “test” switch when the current brand’s inventory is not available or failed at a specific customer service requirement. 

And if the “test” switch is successful then the customer is unlikely to return until another of these inflection events occur 

What I noticed when studying the market segment on Amazon is that inventory of competitors are not always available for sale.

So these type of “test” switch situations will occur more frequently than usual. 

So if price is kept on par, the more convenient it is in terms of waiting time before receiving their products, the more likely a “test” switch occur. 

At that point, it’s just to habitually retain these new “switchers”
[7/16/23, 5:30:56 AM] Gary Teh: How long does a pack usually last you?
[7/16/23, 5:53:08 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: This is true. I have seen this too with local businesses. To add on the switch perspective, you should always have inventory. Lack of inventory allows customers to test out others, when done so often they might not circle back if differentiation is slight.
[7/16/23, 6:05:50 AM] Kelvin Chew: Ages bro. Cos u scoop one spoon each time

[7/16/23, 6:35:50 AM] Gary Teh: Reminds me of how DataBrics and SnowFlake does their enterprise customer acquisition 
They target company whose data warehousing contracts are expiring 

This was what’s mentioned by Sujit and Gautam who worked in that space
[7/16/23, 6:40:05 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yes.

[7/16/23, 7:04:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: If u compete with price. U will doom the product

[7/16/23, 11:16:39 AM] Anupa/diya: Pricing and taste. I am guessing organic is a given. 

We should also narrow down on the target user ..

Are we looking price and taste led user or the ones that ethically and more organically driven because the narrative will be driven? 

Should we look at doing the quick focus group just to validate our insights
[7/16/23, 11:26:50 AM] Gary Teh: Our primary target market is Keto users because we know those are the most lucrative and largest market segment in the USA right now
[7/16/23, 11:28:28 AM] Gary Teh: For our facetime session tomorrow, I think we should focus on the following agenda

    - generating the questions we want asked during the focus group with the keto users we find in Bay Area
    - content architecture of the keto user consumer focus website (minus the content)
[7/16/23, 11:29:26 AM] Anupa/diya: Yep !
[7/16/23, 11:30:13 AM] Anupa/diya: If we can just send out a quick questionnaire go the keto or cacao nibs consumers In the group.
[7/16/23, 11:31:12 AM] Gary Teh: That can be done once we figured out what the questions are
[7/16/23, 11:38:23 AM] Gary Teh: Documents we will work on tomorrow

[7/16/23, 2:57:26 PM] Gary Teh: Can you further elaborate on what you mean by taste nice? Naming objective attributes you consider will be really really helpful.
[7/16/23, 3:21:04 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/16/23, 3:23:47 PM] Gary Teh: These are the objective attributes that I noticed my brain used to identify whether I like a variant versus another during my taste testing of the cacao nibs

    - the size of the chunks
    - how dark the cacao nibs appeared
    - the strength of the fragrance when I first opened the package
    - the sound of crunch
    - the initial bliss point which gets triggered in the brain due to sudden release of dopamine. 
        - If you were ever a smoker the experience is quite similar to your very first puff after a long long time
            - (sense of hearing) the crackling sound a nicely dried cigarette makes when you make your first draw after lighting it up
            - (sense of smell) the fragrance that hits nostril after the first puff
            - (dopamine release) the initial high which can get so giddy you almost can't stand on your feet when that very major dose of dopamine gets released from your brain into your blood stream

    - the length of time the fragrance lingers in my nose after I finished chewing and swallowing the cacao nibs
    - the bitterness of the after taste
‎[7/16/23, 3:33:58 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/16/23, 3:34:04 PM] Gary Teh: if you like something mellow and fruiter  stick to the Dominican Republic variant.
[7/16/23, 3:34:21 PM] Gary Teh: if you like something mild and relaxed stick to the Peruvian variant.
[7/16/23, 3:35:31 PM] Gary Teh: When I checked the source printed on the packaging labels of the other competitors, seems the Peruvian variant is what most USA sellers are offering. 

I am really curious how the Ecuadorian variant will taste like once I get the sample shipped over by our supplier
[7/16/23, 3:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: In my head, tobacco, coffee, wine and cacao, they all belong in the same category due to the pathways via our five senses they utilize to trigger the release of dopamine during the very first time they are consumed over the course of the day.
[7/16/23, 3:55:49 PM] Gary Teh: If I imagined myself back on the keto diet which I had been on for an entire year, I wouldn't use tobacco and wine because they would mess around with my body chemistry which is very important for keto diet.

Coffee is boring since everyone is already doing it. Bullet Proof coffee has been around for years.

Cacao seems like the right kind of "prop" to use if you are within the keto social circles and want to make a strong first impression. Its like how the "cool" kids in the Bay Area were smoking marijuanna before it got legalized in the USA. 

Nowadays the "cool" kids have moved on to magic mushrooms. I would imagine once everyone else starts using magic mushrooms, the "cool" kids will move on to amanita muscaria
[7/16/23, 10:29:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: Taste nice means when eat it. Tastes like the chocolate. And I go. Hmmmm nice. Instead of. Ewwwww what shit is this.

[7/16/23, 11:01:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: U see again u miss the point
[7/16/23, 11:02:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: U wanna charge as if u are a common grocery item
[7/16/23, 11:02:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hence this is how the common man determines taste.
[7/16/23, 11:02:48 PM] Gary Teh: Propose what you have in mind
[7/16/23, 11:03:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: IF you wanna charge and have people taste nibs like some fine dining item
[7/16/23, 11:03:17 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then u charge a fine dining price
[7/16/23, 11:03:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: People are drawn to expensive luxury exclusivity
[7/16/23, 11:03:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: Rich people want to be rich and brag about it
[7/16/23, 11:04:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: Either u go fight price war and don’t expect people to really care about your special farm to table story
[7/16/23, 11:04:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Or u charge higher. At the expensive range. And sell your story and your refined taste
[7/16/23, 11:04:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: This is the proposition
[7/16/23, 11:06:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Cos the common person like me. Pours nibs over oats or cereal. Drown it with almond or oat milk and crunch it whilst reading the news preparing for work.
[7/16/23, 11:06:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: And I sure as hell don’t care about any story or refine taste. So long as I enjoy it
[7/16/23, 11:07:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: So I am definitely not your target market. Which from what I read so far. You are campaigning in this field
[7/16/23, 11:07:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: YET
[7/16/23, 11:08:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: You all are talking price as if you are going to stoop to the common battlefield where common consumers like me hang out. Watching you all murder each other via price war. And we grab whichever that is on sale that says organic and that we felt taste nice
[7/16/23, 11:09:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: So know your market Gary
[7/16/23, 11:09:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Who is your target
[7/16/23, 11:09:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ask urself this. Then campaign accordingly
[7/16/23, 11:18:01 PM] Gary Teh: very good points. 🙂👍🏻

[7/17/23, 9:20:24 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I personally use the word ritual
[7/17/23, 9:21:11 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It could be a tasting.   But there isn't so much overlap.
[7/17/23, 9:21:16 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : or workshop
[7/17/23, 9:21:47 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : everything can be a ritual, I mean making bullet coffee......that a whole process
[7/17/23, 9:22:32 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : what about bullet cacao :)
[7/17/23, 9:23:10 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : or a workshop about healthy fat.
[7/17/23, 9:23:56 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I think there is a significant number of people who are "keto inspired"    they start with a keto diet and modify it to better fit there needs
[7/17/23, 9:27:33 PM] Iwona Fluda: We used to run lots of workshops also on this topic. Process x creativity x trust x connection would be the hashtags.
‎[7/17/23, 9:30:44 PM] Gary Teh: ‎<attached: 00000855-PHOTO-2023-07-17-21-30-44.jpg>
[7/17/23, 9:38:01 PM] Gary Teh: I think I remembered myself doing on a daily basis when I was on the keto diet for six months and the inter-mitten fasting for the other six months (no food at all on Mondays and Tuesdays) was how I would measure my body-fat percentage every single morning using a Whitings weighing scale.
‎[7/17/23, 9:38:47 PM] Gary Teh: ‎<attached: 00000857-PHOTO-2023-07-17-21-38-47.jpg>
[7/17/23, 9:39:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : There are probably certain benefits of the fat in cacao specificly
[7/17/23, 9:41:03 PM] Gary Teh: boosting the percentage of fat in your diet has the counter-intuitive effect of causing your body's fat percentage to drop. Since below a certain level of sugar in your bloodstream your body enters into ketosis.
[7/17/23, 9:41:21 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I know coconut oil has caprylic acid which is anti fungal and anti inflammatory
[7/17/23, 9:42:16 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : oleic acid   that's in cacao
[7/17/23, 9:43:43 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Such as oleic acid found in cacao can lower bad cholesterol and raise good cholesterol levels.

Oleic acid also possesses antioxidant properties and can fight free radicals.

It can strengthen cell membrane integrity, boost memory power, improve the functioning of the heart, circulatory system, and brain, increase energy levels, help with weight loss, reduce inflammatory conditions like arthritis, help to moisturize the skin and more.
[7/17/23, 10:07:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: If I were to do this
[7/17/23, 10:07:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: I won’t be selling it this manner
[7/17/23, 10:07:55 PM] Gary Teh: What would your approach be?
[7/17/23, 10:08:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s why
[7/17/23, 10:09:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hahaha. U going to award me for my sales strategy then?
[7/17/23, 10:09:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Cos I am never cheap
[7/17/23, 10:10:31 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. This scenario has been catered for in our rubric 

https://TrueSight.me/rubric
[7/17/23, 10:11:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ok. Then
[7/17/23, 10:14:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Let me get this right first. 

Problems
1) you don’t have economics of scale. Hence you cannot sell things for cheap. Because there is no way you can get operating cost down low enough to increase your profit margins. 

HENCE by giving it at a generally accepted price. Means you are handicapping yourself. Immediately. Because you are competing with people who has economics of scale.
[7/17/23, 10:16:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2) taste testing as you mentioned has hardly any discernible difference. Hence you will not able to bait a switch of product brand from existing users. 

So all the taste comparisons. Don’t waste time on it. So long as our nibs taste good enough. That is taken care by it self. 

Plus tasting bags of nibs and having focus groups asking people to taste the difference is just waste of time.
[7/17/23, 10:17:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: 3) as you identified. The feature you want to sell most is the experience. The story behind the product. 

The problem then becomes marketing. How are you going to sell the story to vast amounts of people. Not only that. Make it viral
[7/17/23, 10:18:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: Is this so far correct?
[7/17/23, 10:18:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: From what I have read in your threads
[7/17/23, 10:19:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: So then. The solution to your problems is actually here.
[7/17/23, 10:19:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: You know what made all these companies successful. How they made a common product sell so well?
[7/17/23, 10:19:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: One common strategy. 

They are all MLM type sales.
[7/17/23, 10:20:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Solution
[7/17/23, 10:20:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: 1) sell it more expensive than the others with a large percentage of profit to your sales people as commission via a MLM tiering structure. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/17/23, 10:22:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2) since it’s a story driven product. You need people to tell your story. Hence MLM tiering sales relies heavily on incentivising people to capture the attention of other people. 

Each person receiving commissions will share their story of the cacao to sell more product. 

To recruit more people to sell your product
[7/17/23, 10:24:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: 3) this way you avoid huge media related marketing cost. Your marketing cost will narrow down to a good website. A good MLM sales tracking system. A good trainer to create stories for your sales people to sell. 

The rest is up to your sales people who works purely on their own commission to share their stories. Hence no basic salary. No initial cost. 

The benefits of MLM are you tend to attract highly ambitious and money hungry people. You then have aggressive or highly initiative type sales
[7/17/23, 10:26:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: 4) meanwhile whilst you are going through the forest. Self film your journey. From its origins. To show why it is differently grown than others. 

Then show the end benefits. Have a nutritionist analyse the product. And highly successful people who use the ritual to create the story of how it helps them do what they do. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/17/23, 10:28:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: So hence. This is the overall strategy

1) cheap
2) self hiring self viral sale people
3) low initial cost and yet high story telling.
[7/17/23, 10:29:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Now let’s compare the other types of strategy

1) place on a supermarket shelf?
- nobody will read your labels and stories. High competition. No differentiation captured within the first 5 seconds. 

2) rely on a good website?
- high marketing cost to get people to visit it. And then subsequently getting them sold on the story
[7/17/23, 10:31:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Your business my friend. 

Is not a product business. 

It’s a story business 

Hence don’t waste your time so much on the product development. 

But selling the story based on a product. 

The cacao nibs is but a tool. 

The story IS the product

And people tell stories. 

Hence you need loads of people
[7/17/23, 10:35:50 PM] Gary Teh: 🙂👍🏻
[7/17/23, 10:36:42 PM] Gary Teh: Strategy totally aligns with why we went all the way down to all the farms in South America.
[7/17/23, 10:36:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: I know. Cos I read everything u said
[7/17/23, 10:37:10 PM] Iwona Fluda: @14153000019 - if you need some additional marketing eyes and ears, let me know.
[7/17/23, 10:37:21 PM] Gary Teh: Yes we do 🙂🙏
[7/17/23, 10:37:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: What u need is a good product packaging. More luxurious OR special than ur competitors
[7/17/23, 10:38:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: A good sales kit for your MLM team
[7/17/23, 10:38:24 PM] Iwona Fluda: considering the story line, we need sustainable packaging.
[7/17/23, 10:38:31 PM] Iwona Fluda: Tell me more! Call this week?
[7/17/23, 10:38:34 PM] Gary Teh: Also spoken like a true blue Million Dollar Round Table insurance agent! 🤩👍
[7/17/23, 10:38:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: And then develop your commission tiering system such that it highly rewards recruitment and sales
[7/17/23, 10:39:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: Sales is my forte bro
[7/17/23, 10:39:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am like Snow White. If the bird is on the tree. I sing and the bird flies down into the palm of my hand
[7/17/23, 10:39:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: If it doesn’t. I climb the tree to catch them.
[7/17/23, 10:40:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Either way they always end up inside my hand
[7/17/23, 10:40:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol
[7/17/23, 10:40:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: Punt intended LOL
[7/17/23, 10:41:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway your distribution will be like amway and Tupperware. 

Means exclusively. Not in supermarkets
[7/17/23, 10:42:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why do u think thermomix is the latest craze? A $2500 food processor. And hordes of people buying it like it’s free
[7/17/23, 10:43:27 PM] Kelvin Chew: Cos of MLM sales. My own cousin is selling it. And she creates cooking classes at her own time and invites people to her house to taste and share recipes
[7/17/23, 10:43:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: So she can sell more product
[7/17/23, 10:43:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: All free to the company
[7/17/23, 10:44:47 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ideally. Your cacao should have a unique health benefit that others do not.
[7/17/23, 10:44:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ideally…..
[7/17/23, 10:54:34 PM] Anupa/diya: We were looking at the bussiness model .. anyway Tupperware as a later stage roll out. Multi level distribution
[7/17/23, 10:57:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: To me. This is ur initial roll out. Not later stage.
[7/17/23, 11:15:22 PM] Anupa/diya: For this we will need massive funding and manpower. To inculcate such shared goal values amongst people requires  people to people engagement. You need start with global city chapters , then communities and then multi level distribution
[7/17/23, 11:35:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why do u need massive funding?
[7/17/23, 11:35:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: I started one with $50k
[7/17/23, 11:35:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s it
[7/17/23, 11:39:17 PM] Anupa/diya: Along with manpower. Let's chat about this ..
[7/17/23, 11:39:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: And u don’t need manpower
[7/17/23, 11:39:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: Gary himself is the first agent
[7/17/23, 11:39:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: You are the first one in your country
[7/17/23, 11:40:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: I can be the first one in mine
[7/17/23, 11:40:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: The only admin u need is the one processing the orders (front line)
[7/17/23, 11:41:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s on the sales side
[7/17/23, 11:42:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: The only thing u need is a structure to sell the product. Meaning the story delivery method
[7/17/23, 11:42:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: What u are going to say. How to say it. What to show and so on.
[7/17/23, 11:47:32 PM] Anupa/diya: Which is the main thing.
[7/17/23, 11:48:07 PM] Anupa/diya: It has to be collective as we are engaged with various other  things.

We can explore this.
[7/17/23, 11:48:09 PM] Anupa/diya: For sure
[7/18/23, 6:17:22 AM] Gary Teh: Every time I get pulled into an MLM game the only thing that happens is that I end up paying for products but never successfully selling any myself 

I studied the profile of the really really strong MLM sellers, very very different profile and inclinations compared to myself. 

I believe for this to work in the USA, we need to find a @6590995199 profile in the USA.
[7/18/23, 6:18:01 AM] Gary Teh: The sales deck?
[7/18/23, 6:19:25 AM] Gary Teh: Sounds like what @573136732781 is trying to do right now
[7/18/23, 6:23:07 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yup correct

[7/18/23, 9:49:24 AM] Gary Teh: I should be free on Friday 

@918017107841 should be done with the wireframing of the website 

I need help figuring out how to structuring and organizing the focus group we are planning 

This is tentatively what we have 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/12F8G7POEorq0Nh0iZD8eMBWVoPm9fLmkRYUgLR6033s/edit

Let’s organize a time where folks experienced in marketing can jump on a chat together on call together this Friday to plan our focus group as well as our “Experience” focused go to market strategy 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J38tgUf7oQ80HajDjJFxhOHVqTo4uc_hRzEYopMTzb0/edit
[7/18/23, 9:53:47 AM] Gary Teh: Key people I have in mind are 

@918017107841 @41796560010 @5511982667030 @16468233438

Folks keen to attend this session please come prepared by reading through the above two documents as well as this one below which is the brand audit of our competitors within the space 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UsBh9BavYq7PYJu7p21yAtBGsQyvY9C3fXA5Ywqy7iY/edit

It will be a working session where we focus on filling in the details of both plans (focus group and go to market)
[7/18/23, 9:58:33 AM] Gary Teh: Shall we do CET 6pm on Friday?
[7/18/23, 10:10:49 AM] Gary Teh: Just a random idea that I have is that folks who make and share their keto recipe on TikTok or Instagram using our cacao nibs will receive governance tokens in our DAO

That will grant them the rights to vote on which ESG initiative to support using the funds we set aside from the sales of our cacao nibs
[7/18/23, 10:21:10 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/18/23, 10:23:10 AM] Gary Teh: All folks who might have ideas on how a “Experience” differentiated based brand experience should be, please surface them here in this channel. 

We will curate and incorporate your ideas into a cohesive whole in our go to market document before we go about executing the documented finalized go to market strategy therein.

You will be in California, right? 
If so, I am 4 hours ahead of you.
It’s going to be 10 pm for me.
[7/18/23, 10:58:06 AM] Gary Teh: I think it’s going to be 1pm your time

I will send out the google calendar invite

[7/18/23, 11:18:14 AM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks Gary. Web3 and fitness are my passions😂

Lol, I just threw away expired bag of cacao nibs. I used it to make keto bomb snacks.

Unbaked - almond flour, protein powder, coconut oil and cacao nibs. Mix into dough and form a ball. Keep it in ziplock bag refrigerated. Good for weekly sweet cravings on keto diet ‎<This message was edited>
[7/18/23, 11:18:47 AM] Gary Teh: What a small world

I have got 5kg of cacao nibs on my backpack
[7/18/23, 11:19:02 AM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Make it rain
‎[7/18/23, 11:19:35 AM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : ‎GIF omitted
[7/18/23, 11:23:29 AM] Gary Teh: For sure! 

Here are some questions I have crafted so far for the keto cacao nibs users focus group we are planning

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NgAhPxeHwGD4ftp1c_Xq2eNC8oJaEpa9aOXorfDOhk/edit#heading=h.gs1vkdgg2a7e

I am think we should definitely give the attendees each a bag of cacao nibs in appreciation for their time and effort.
[7/18/23, 11:23:53 AM] Gary Teh: How large was the bag of cacao nibs you threw away?
[7/18/23, 11:25:34 AM] Meir S. Simhi: ‎You added Meir S. Simhi
[7/18/23, 11:34:58 AM] Gary Teh: Assuming there is a sizable enough population of community within OffChain that also follows keto, one thing might be interesting would be to sponsor sample 1 ounce bags of cacao for the events happening within the Bay area with QR code printed on them to attends.

The QR codes would direct people to our upcoming site with education on what is keto diet, and recipes on how to utilize the cacao to start their keto diet today.
[7/18/23, 11:35:49 AM] Gary Teh: The recipes will be generated and submitted by the community themselves.

Each successful recipe submission will result in the airdrop of governance tokens to their wallet.
[7/18/23, 11:38:39 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Do you think keto has more power than the cacao ceremony trend narrative?

[7/18/23, 11:52:35 AM] Gary Teh: Total governance tokens issued so far for contributions made 1.682 million. I hope you are seeing what I am seeing. 

Pay day for everybody is potentially coming sooner than expected if we execute this one project successfully.

[7/18/23, 11:08:12 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Btw, a majority of cacao farmers here in africa have never tasted chocolate. It is too expensive. 

Some don't even know what happens to the beans after harvest. 

@14153000019 Thanks for all the documentation. 

It will be very useful if we choose to explore African agriculture and the stories here.
[7/19/23, 8:52:29 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. 🤩

The goal of Agroverse is to integrate and uplift entire communities of these marginalized farmers into the direct to consumer network.
[7/19/23, 10:23:27 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: 😊
[7/19/23, 10:26:56 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, if you haven’t already, please submit to indicate how many percent of the profits generated via our network should be kept by our DAO while the rest directed back to the agricultural suppliers for ESG infrastructure upgrades initiatives within their communities 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/preferred-rate
[7/19/23, 12:09:27 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[7/19/23, 12:16:56 PM] Gary Teh: One thing that will greatly help facilitate hooking up of new farmers into our direct to consumer network is if the local DAO member can help source for the following in the local territories

    - package printing company
    - packing company (USFDA registered)
    - shipping/freighting company 
    -  farming cooperatives (USFDA registered / US NOP registered )

We will prioritize territories that have these four components in place into our global distribution network 

we will look into other territories, once our shipping volume outgrows existing production capacity of qualified territories
[7/19/23, 3:36:42 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : That makes alot of sense
[7/19/23, 3:37:02 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I'll look into santender and keep criolla ceremony
[7/19/23, 3:37:39 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I love the small scale but the usfda means what i realized a while ago
[7/19/23, 3:37:55 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Would need a factory a baby factory :)

[7/23/23, 12:27:43 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : There is alot going on.  I think around 8 people is efficent.
[7/23/23, 12:27:52 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Like agile.

[7/23/23, 12:30:55 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Missed a few days need My usa number
[7/23/23, 12:31:16 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I got those but with Windows
[7/23/23, 12:38:04 PM] Gary Teh: If the mission of the guild is differentiated enough from the existing ones and voting for inclusion passes with majority within the governance committee, the answer is yes. 

Please refer to the *Guilds and Projects* section of our white paper on how to propose for the formation of a new guild within our DAO 🙂👍

[7/30/23, 9:21:46 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys. I know I keep on jumping in and out of convos. It’s been a tough year so far
[7/30/23, 9:23:19 AM] Francois renet: As far as selling the nibs, have you thought of selling through touch of modern? That have different products everyday and I’ve seen fair trade coffee for example before. They have a huge mailing list and because there is a variety of products the open rate is pretty high. Just a quick thought!
[7/30/23, 9:38:17 AM] Gary Teh: What is touch of modern? Is it a company? 🙂
[7/30/23, 10:08:44 AM] Francois renet: It’s a website. https://www.touchofmodern.com

[7/30/23, 10:50:08 AM] Gary Teh: Starting to feel like to power some aspects of our growth engine, we will need to incentivize the adoption of our tokens amongst the keto demographic. And the natural way to do so is to allow them the ability to exchange their tokens for packages of cacao nibs at cost price instead of the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price if they paid for them using Fiat money.
[7/30/23, 10:56:05 AM] Gary Teh: Once we have our inventory ready in the warehouse, it makes sense to start discussions with them. 

Do you know someone working in the company?
[7/30/23, 10:59:11 AM] Tess walkowski: The name of the market of the man I listen to is merchant of vino

    - completed one version of focus group questions 

    - Brazilian said still sourcing for manufacturer willing to take on small batch manufacturing 

    - Ecaudor supplier still waiting for manufacturer to respond on quotation for packaging small batch

    - Ecuador supplier still waiting for their cooperatives to respond with sending samples to USA for focus group 

    - Peruvian samples for focus group arrived

    - sourced for commercial facility to self pack the cacao nibs here in the US

    - sourced for storage facility

    - coming up with some marketing materials to experiment with a B2B2C attempt here in SF
[7/31/23, 10:37:47 PM] Gary Teh: The focus group will clarify if keto diet customers prioritize cacao nibs' origin. If not, we can simplify the supply chain by sourcing from different farmers for their ESG needs. However, this may affect our presentation to the web3.0 community in our white paper.

    - started executing on recruiting participants for our upcoming focus groups


Needs 
——
    - more help recruiting participants for our focus group - people who are or had used cacao nibs for their keto diet
[8/3/23, 4:34:03 AM] Barbara Sandini: Unfortunately I don’t know anyone but I’ll ask around
[8/3/23, 12:47:26 PM] Gary Teh: There are around more than 8 million keto forums out there. Probably too much time and effort for one person to really handle it in a scalable manner. 

I proposing to release funds of USD1000 from our vault to hire a data entry clerk on behalf of our DAO to plough through the top 1000 of these forums and post a message like this elicit the insights we are hoping to get

https://www.discusscooking.com/threads/calling-all-keto-nib-enthusiasts-share-your-cacao-wisdom-%F0%9F%8D%AB%F0%9F%92%AA.136762/

So it will be USD1 per forum.

After this deployment the asset in our vault will be down to USD2000.

[8/3/23, 12:58:50 PM] Fatima: Gary, why do we need to advertise this now?

Please, calm down.

Better wait to have a good value proposition (after focus group) and than advertise.
[8/3/23, 12:59:59 PM] Gary Teh: It’s not for advertising 

It’s just gathering participants for our focus group or if they don’t come just trigger off the release of insights within the post themselves
[8/3/23, 1:01:47 PM] Fatima: Gary, we will find people.
Don’t need to spend USD1000 to hire a data entry clerk…
[8/3/23, 1:04:40 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. 

The gist of it is, I am open to utilizing USD from our vault to pay and have qualified research participants come for our focus groups. 🙂👍
[8/3/23, 1:08:38 PM] Tess walkowski: Put a head hunting fee or pay the participants of the study
[8/3/23, 1:09:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Is it that challenging to find? Just offer the keto peeps $50
[8/3/23, 1:22:27 PM] Gary Teh: Why not split the USD50 between the recruiter and the participant?

USD15 for recruiter
USD35 for participant
[8/3/23, 1:24:09 PM] Gary Teh: Since we are conducting 3 focus groups, and 6 participants for each. 

We are looking at a total of 18 participants. That USD900 

Slightly less than USD1000 budget proposed earlier.

[8/3/23, 1:54:48 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like USD1000 budget is sufficient enough to play around with to get the insights we needs 

What other thoughts and ideas are there to getting what we need from the focus groups??
[8/3/23, 1:54:54 PM] Tess walkowski: It's smart to maybe overbook if people don't show
[8/3/23, 1:55:15 PM] Tess walkowski: In ux class they told us to go stand outside a super market
[8/3/23, 1:55:45 PM] Tess walkowski: What worked for me was asking everyone in the youth hostel.   I got my six interviews
[8/3/23, 1:56:08 PM] Tess walkowski: I did it one by one day Rathet than a focus group

Prize increases to USD300,000 when shipment size increases to 15,000KG which is the market segment saturation point in a given month. 🤔
[8/3/23, 5:16:51 PM] Gary Teh: @6590995199 I believe we can dust off the game design mechanics you came up with last year and reuse it again

[8/3/23, 7:44:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Some of the questions you have poses in the above discussions are very relevant.  I also really recommend googles ux course.  Module 2 knocks out the concepts and approach of ux
[8/3/23, 7:45:37 PM] Tess walkowski: I got six interviews in a day at a hostel.  Sit in front of whole foods.  Find a them there!
[8/3/23, 7:46:39 PM] Tess walkowski: Too complicated.
[8/3/23, 7:46:51 PM] Tess walkowski: Also why does it have to be in person
[8/3/23, 7:47:09 PM] Tess walkowski: What about LinkedIn
[8/3/23, 7:47:48 PM] Tess walkowski: I did a poll there once 100 percent of users have paid more than $5 for a chocolate treat
[8/3/23, 9:11:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: I agree
[8/3/23, 9:11:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why don’t participants get nibs instead
[8/3/23, 9:11:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: Free product samples
[8/3/23, 9:12:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: So first it’s marketing
[8/3/23, 9:12:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Second. U don’t pay money for information readily available online
[8/3/23, 9:12:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: I wanna know what questions u have that is so critical that it requires a focus group

[8/10/23, 2:43:21 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 managed to validate yesterday that the Kraft pouch we bought on Amazon successfully holds 8 ounces of cacao nibs 

During the focus group on the 20th we will be able to get feedbacks from participants for the two different types of packaging 

    - Kraft pouch 
    - Custom bags

https://truesight.me/ttl
[8/11/23, 9:15:20 PM] Gary Teh: *Key updates for the day*

_Agroverse_
    - Reached out to Dean about Gifting our cacao nib samples to camp Moon Drive during the upcoming Burning Man
    - Reached out to SeaCoastLogistics the partner company of OmegaService the freighting company the Brazilian cooperative is partnered with. 
    - We are clarifying what is the actual modified FSVP requirements for small importers and small producers
    - Refreshing version 1 of updated Brazilian package designs to fit to the dimensions given by their packaging company.
[8/11/23, 9:33:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, any progress on qr code and website?
[8/11/23, 9:34:42 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. Nothing yet. 
QR code is easy to generate. 
Will try to start the site on Monday. Bulk of the copywriting could be done using ChatGpt since we got the gist of the content. 

Dean mentioned Mobile reception might be bad over at that place.
[8/11/23, 9:35:33 PM] Val Lapidus: I think they'll not have access to a grinder while there and will take the sample home and once they get home they can scan it the QR that is
[8/11/23, 9:36:41 PM] Gary Teh: Might just end up using Wix or Wordpress for our MVP, throw in a template insert our logo, some photos we took during our Brazil Trip or generated using Stable Diffusion AI.
[8/11/23, 9:38:46 PM] Gary Teh: You will be very surprised. There are a bunch of very very hardcore engineers in camp Moon Drive. 

Dean literally built a portable heated shower which we used there.
Carlo built a solar powered bugee which they used to drive around the playa.

Chat with Dean when we meet on Tuesday to get a sense how he is planning to help spread the word.

[8/16/23, 5:14:14 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 when you get the package will need your help with two items

    - please take a photo of the condition of the content within
    - get the quoted price from the Postal Office based the shipping configuration you usually use for shipping out your stuff and send it back to us.
[8/16/23, 5:18:51 PM] Tess walkowski: Wait you want me to send the nibs back too?
[8/16/23, 5:19:33 PM] Gary Teh: Check the cost of sending it back and let us know what it cost you 

But Don’t send it. Use the material within for your RnD
[8/16/23, 5:20:13 PM] Tess walkowski: I will ask them about the weight restrictions when I go next. I think under 8oz is $5.10 / $4.10 with the account
[8/16/23, 5:20:32 PM] Tess walkowski: If that's what it is we might want 7.7 oz packages
[8/16/23, 5:20:53 PM] Gary Teh: Please check with them once you have the package with you and let us know
[8/16/23, 5:38:47 PM] Tess walkowski: Yeah I'll go verbally ask any questions you have
[8/16/23, 5:39:33 PM] Tess walkowski: I have all the prepaid flat rates in my car too

[8/16/23, 8:02:59 PM] Gary Teh: What becomes really interesting would be to map out the turn by turn behavior of people who successfully adopted adopted cacao nibs for their daily diet. Figure out what the generalized patterns are

Then figure out how to help other people following keto diet quickly onboard on to the same set of behavioral patterns

[8/18/23, 5:18:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Those are raw?
[8/18/23, 5:18:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Has that cacao bean been roasted? Before being broken into nibs?
[8/18/23, 5:19:14 PM] Tess walkowski: It's not roasted right?
[8/18/23, 5:22:12 PM] Gary Teh: It’s roasted already
[8/18/23, 5:22:32 PM] Gary Teh: Then and only then broken into nibs
[8/18/23, 5:22:45 PM] Tess walkowski: ....de Peru....?

[8/18/23, 5:26:30 PM] Tess walkowski: ...I haven't had nibs often...
[8/18/23, 5:26:46 PM] Tess walkowski: I am gonna crush a bean from my other to compare
[8/18/23, 5:26:58 PM] Tess walkowski: It arrived quick.
[8/18/23, 5:27:20 PM] Tess walkowski: I'm gonna taste it again.  I also don't have a comparison.
[8/18/23, 5:27:38 PM] Tess walkowski: There is something in the smell and I'm trying hard to place it
[8/18/23, 5:33:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: The label does not. Look like it’s a premium product.
[8/18/23, 5:33:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Does not look like*
[8/18/23, 5:39:34 PM] Tess walkowski: The label wore off in transit
[8/18/23, 5:39:44 PM] Tess walkowski: It looks worn or aged.
[8/18/23, 5:40:00 PM] Tess walkowski: There is an astringent note
[8/18/23, 5:40:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is why asked if it was raw
[8/18/23, 5:40:35 PM] Tess walkowski: I thought maybe roasting would sweeten
[8/18/23, 5:41:03 PM] Tess walkowski: There is something on the nose and less in the taste and I don't smell it on my criolla
[8/18/23, 5:41:55 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll get some saltines crush a bean, and do all three and then a heat test
[8/18/23, 6:01:20 PM] Gary Teh: Let us know how you eventually consumed it and if you ended up consuming the whole pack or left it somewhere

[8/18/23, 6:03:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I ate a few
[8/18/23, 6:03:45 PM] Tess walkowski: The taste that I smell it's not in every nib
[8/18/23, 6:04:21 PM] Tess walkowski: I have another roasted bean so I'll crack and bag, it could just be how the beans are
[8/18/23, 6:04:41 PM] Tess walkowski: Some nibs are more bitter
[8/18/23, 6:39:10 PM] Gary Teh: Or even the fermentation process

[8/18/23, 7:10:07 PM] Tess walkowski: That's like apples to oranges 😀

[8/18/23, 7:11:36 PM] Tess walkowski: They ferment them in trays
[8/18/23, 7:11:59 PM] Tess walkowski: And roast them in cast iron pots on an open fire....lightly
[8/18/23, 7:16:34 PM] Tess walkowski: And then we put them in a meat grinder
[8/18/23, 7:17:02 PM] Tess walkowski: I paid about $20 kilo for criolla.

[8/19/23, 7:41:43 AM] Gary Teh: Templates for qualifying future farming cooperatives will be generated and made available here 

https://GitHub.com/truesightdao/fda_fsvp

DAO members will be able to utilize the templates therein to start the verification process for their farmer friend’s facilities

Actual qualification for importing for sale into the USA market will be done by the Qualified individual in our DAO.
[8/19/23, 7:46:52 AM] Gary Teh: I believe the business model of DnB.com makes a lot of sense. 

All records awaiting for qualification will be put into a queue to be processed at the rate according to FSPCA Qualified Individual discretion (highly dependent on available bandwidth)

For records to be put in the expedited queue, there will be charge of DAO governance tokens.  Let’s use the market rates we have uncovered so far.

    - 6000TDG for normal sized businesses

[8/20/23, 6:41:05 PM] Anupa/diya: This is great. Did you guys manage to document with photos
[8/20/23, 7:44:44 PM] Gary Teh: Not much. 

Here are the notes

[8/20/23, 7:47:50 PM] Gary Teh: All of the folks who ended up coming via meetup.com were tree huggers 

They were really really impressed by the premium packaging but preferred the brown paper looking Kraft pouch packaging as it felt earthier and made they feel more connected to the farmers which was more aligned with our brand story

[8/21/23, 5:35:03 PM] Gary Teh: Finished our 30 minutes facetime session between @16468233438 @5511982667030 and myself. 

*Verdict*
    - we will import the 100KG raw from Brazil, rent a certified kitchen here in Bay Area and package the initial 100KG
    - @16468233438 will continue to run focus groups using the 6 samples even after I leave for Brazil to collect enough data on which taste to lock in on
    - I will passing the winning sample over to the President of the Brazilian Cooperative to lock down the taste to be delivered
    - I will attempt to pay a visit to another cooperative right in the Brazilian Amazon region to source for more cacao nibs
[8/21/23, 5:37:13 PM] Gary Teh: *Key updates for the day*

    - Did a walk through of the version of agroverse website that @918017107841 has worked on. Trying to figure out how to merge these two. Wix is not making it easy
    - Conducted an outdoor photo shoot of our product by the beach
    - Updated the official agroverse.shop to attempt at incorporating some of the elements that @918017107841 has created
    - Locked down the supply chain configuration we will be utilizing for this initial 100KG (Shipped from Brazil. Packaged in USA)
[8/21/23, 6:54:10 PM] Gary Teh: By the way please note that we have started tokenizing the use of @16468233438 space as office and RnD kitchen 

Tokenization will be at the rate similar to Hanahaus co-working space in Palo Alto which charges USD4 per person per hour
[8/22/23, 12:53:30 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 amazing update to Agroverse.shop landing page! 🤩

[8/22/23, 2:04:36 PM] Tomas - Offchain: since packaging is a low proto solution i would rather use a cacao field for the landing
[8/22/23, 2:14:22 PM] Gary Teh: *B-Corp* is becoming a very strong signal within our DAO's ecosystem. 3 occurrences of it within the past 7 days

    - Shadi
    - Ambarish
    - Daniell Sunberg

*follow up in mind*
    - Follow up with Shadi on this once he finishes helping us setup our main DAO's website. He has had experience setting it up. Meeting with him this coming Thursday to do a walk through of the site he is working on that @918017107841 designed
    - Follow up with Casey (CEO of Disconnect Inc) I remember when I was still working in that company there were conversations around setting up it as a B-Corp. And they did eventually went that way

[8/25/23, 3:05:01 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is very difficult to find circular packaging solutions. I have seen bags, that are shipped, and returned to use them more often. material mis is always a problem, but in the end the products need to travel aafe and the sorting machines are not gentle. I had to switch to a stronger solution because of it.
[8/25/23, 3:06:25 PM] Tess walkowski: It's very difficult I feel you struggling with same

[8/25/23, 9:11:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Actually I think that's the correct idea too when they are mixed u can't recycle at all so hard
[8/26/23, 9:16:51 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. Hans Martin and the folks working on the ski equipment industry surfaced the same problem as well when we met up those two times in Davos. 

The original idea Hans Martin posited was to transition their supply chain to a circular economy and then tokenize the individual components. 

Unfortunately, after meeting up for two times months apart I figured that supply chain is very slow moving behemoth with lots of parts that required manufacturing. 

And that was when @971561302188 reached out with the problem of poverty in Africa. Her prompt inspired looking into applying the circular economy and tokenization to a supply chain that has less parts that required manufacturing 

A few months later@13134136108 jumped in with her fanatic love for cacao which tilted the direction for us to land on that produce during our poll

And here we are today 1 years and three months after the first meeting of the ski industry folks in Davos on the cusp on bringing in our first shipment of cacao nibs from South America into USA. 

If this project does prove successful, if anyone who criticizes that the WEF (world economic forum) in Davos is just all talk and no substantial outcome could be referred to the Agroverse project which idea was in Peter there. 🤣

[8/30/23, 11:59:39 AM] Gary Teh: @4915785523192 do you think we might be able to refer us to the US branch for OVH?

I figure the Switzerland Association is going to take a while to setup

I think it makes sense to utilize the OVH cloud to spin up the necessary instances to provide API interface that the mobile solutions will call to written to the chain (Ethereum or Q) 

Please let me know 🙂🙏
[8/30/23, 1:27:47 PM] Gary Teh: *additional requirements*

[8/31/23, 10:47:23 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we are done with the final portion of the FSVP (foreign supplier verification program) certification it has became evident that since we will be shifting a portion of our manufacturing (cacao nibs packing) process within the borders of USA, we will need to develope a food safety plan and good manufacturing practice policy to secure those sections of our supply chain 

To develop and implement that section of our supply chain we will need to engage the service of a PCQI (Preventive Control Qualified Individual) 

there are two possible options. 

Option 1) Hire one and pay him/her to draft it up once 

Option 2) build up  in-house capabilities by getting certified ourselves 

The latter route will allow us immense maneuverability later on as we configure and reconfigure on our shore supply chains by adding more and more decentralized nodes to our onshore USA food processing/manufacturing network.  

Let’s do a poll
[8/31/23, 10:50:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
How shall we handle the need for a PCQI for our onshore compliance needs?
‎OPTION: Utilize a portion of the proceeds already released from our vault to hire a PCQI (0 votes)
‎OPTION: Acquire PCQI certification in house using proceeds already release from our vault (4 votes)
‎OPTION: Evangelize a new DAO member who is already PCQI certified to do it in exchange for governance tokens (0 votes)
[8/31/23, 10:51:54 AM] Gary Teh: The cheapest PCQI course to get certified  I found online was this one 

https://www.aibinternational.com/products/pcqi-online/

One way or the other we will need that certification as soon as the shipment of cacao nibs arrive in USA and we start repackaging it
[8/31/23, 11:57:11 AM] Val Lapidus: Any idea how long that course is?  I think I would be interested in taking it

There is always opportunity cost especially for people who are already generating a lot of value in other domains
[9/2/23, 9:25:07 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Individual purpose that connects with the communal objectives. Opportunity costs that match the value of belongings here.
[9/2/23, 9:26:07 AM] Gary Teh: Still too vague 

Let’s just reframe it 

Why are you still here and contributing your time to this discussion?
[9/2/23, 9:27:28 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Because I'm writing about that and the DAO itself gives me the chance to think more about this and think on viable solutions. Connects my purpose with the needs of the DAO
[9/2/23, 9:34:17 AM] Anupa/diya: There should be a third option. Who ever wants to take the project forward has the ability to do so.

I think November will be like a trial period to see how things work when Gary goes into Hybernation.
[9/2/23, 9:34:26 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @14153000019 

Is it possible for us to design systems that allow us to have longevity with or without the founder?

Can we make it an experiment?

From my observation, this is the most exemplary DAO I've been part of. 

We can fine tune things wrt responsibilities to ease the weight on your shoulders. 

If the experiment fails, we will have some learnings.
[9/2/23, 10:48:43 AM] Gary Teh: I think that would be perfect and absolutely desirable 🙂🙏
[9/2/23, 10:57:19 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Thank you. For starters, I think we will need generals and succession plans if we don't have that in place.

[9/3/23, 7:34:15 AM] Gary Teh: Come the Autumn Equinox (22nd Sep 2023), the new set of governors will be rotated into position

*Current Policy*
    - *Parameter 1 - Total number of governors*: 10
    - *Parameter 2- Tenure*: 3 months
    - *Parameter 3 - Selection criteria*: top 10 contributors for past 90 days

Let's relook into how governors are selected, discuss and then agree upon a new set of policy (3 parameters) on how new governors should be selected (elected), thereafter vote this new policy into effect in our town hall.

We can consider additional parameters on top of the 3 existing ones.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.n1zi2ph05oau

As well as a more detailed documentation of the API end points that will be exposed via our server clusters (perhaps ran in our SunMint off-grid data center)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit#heading=h.ftxgqr5vdhij

Farmers/manufacturers are paid tokens whenever they conduct preventive control verification activities on chain. The value of these tokens will be backed by the profit from sales of their product in USA. 

This is even for farmers who we are not yet getting supplies from. Their adoption of the solution will just make it super easy for us to onboard them as foreign suppliers as they will become compliant with FSVP requirements as soon as they adopt our solution. This means we don't need to jump through as many hoops onboarding them.

PS: regarding the SunMint off grid data center, me and @16468233438 (perhaps Dean who built solar powered buggies for Burning Man) will experiment with implementing a fully solar powered prototype in @16468233438's backyard once I get back to California.

Once we have gotten FSVP compliance written assurance letter from the agriculture cooperative as well as proven the viability of our go to market with our very first batch of cacao nib sales we will compile the materials required to assemble a fundraising deck. We will approach the Ethereum foundation as well as social impact funds for financing to accelerate the build out of the prototype documented.

Bulk of what was priorly planned fell through today. 

Episode 2 of Bean to Bliss - Journey from Salvador to Itacare is going to be super interesting if not dramatic 🤩
[9/7/23, 9:11:46 AM] Tess walkowski: I have it light around numbers.  And my left right.
[9/7/23, 9:12:15 AM] Tess walkowski: Do you have a moment to put your feet in the grass and just breath.
[9/7/23, 9:12:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Transit is intimidating in a new place.
[9/7/23, 9:13:16 AM] Tess walkowski: I'm headed to the farmer conference today or tomorrow

[9/8/23, 6:51:45 AM] Gary Teh: Had a great chat with Verma who was introduced by @918017107841 

*key outputs*
    - Verma has no bandwidth to help develop the tech stack for Agroverse
    - Verma has surfaced Refi (Regenerative finance) as a new Web3 domain. This differs from Defi (Decentralized finance) because as its purely focused on financing environmentally regenerative projects

*Follow ups*
    - Verma has sent link to 2 related Refi projects that we could follow up with
        - https://ethereum.org/en/refi/ (for financing)
        - https://toucan.earth/ (DAO focus on Amazon region)

I have Pinged @972543523823 to do the correction
[9/8/23, 2:26:19 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Would it make more sense use agroverse cacao to manufactre a different product to add more value?
[9/8/23, 3:00:56 PM] Gary Teh: Later on. Too complicated a supply chain to manage right now 

Nutrition labeling for FDA compliance is going to be a nightmare 

We make money first selling cacao nibs and then invest in new product RnD later
[9/8/23, 3:02:14 PM] Tomas - Offchain: i found a use case in argentina were they use cacao but wanted to be sure before using time on that
[9/8/23, 3:02:15 PM] Tomas - Offchain: ok
[9/8/23, 3:13:03 PM] Gary Teh: If you could send some samples to the USA 

We could do a focus group to test market receptiveness 

If overall positive, then we will do
    - lab test
    - nutrition panel design 
    - …. The whole nine yards 

It’s too much capital outlay for now. We don’t have that much capital to splash all over the place 

We recoup our capital outlay with sales first before looking at further rnd on the product side

[9/8/23, 6:15:43 PM] Gary Teh: I think the recent trial onboarding protocol with V was successful

Rather than allowing V directly into our ecosystem, he was kept in a holding bay 

He was only allowed entry into our beer hall after we have had an interview with him and ascertained he is of value to our DAO 

Only then was he allowed into our beer hall

At which point he had already made some contributions to our DAO

I propose we roll out this new protocol for a new DaO member onboarding

“Agroverse promotes regenerative finance by connecting sustainable farmers with global markets, fostering economic growth in underserved regions, and ensuring fair compensation for eco-conscious practices. Through blockchain technology, it creates transparent and ethical financial systems, aligning profit with environmental and social benefits.”
[9/10/23, 6:32:18 AM] Suheil - Europe: starting to play around --> https://www.instagram.com/p/CxA03YkMXP2/ 

to be continued... 

Meanwhile, we need dao members to follow and like the Instagram page. 

Any members who is "IN" in being engaged to help us push organic (by giving us couple of minutes of their time to share/like/comment social posts) please raise your hand

example of organic trick : 
- imagine the results if, for this post ,we tag like X amount  of members and each re share from their profile.

If u cant imagine, i can tell you from experience , results come in BIG :)
[9/10/23, 6:42:21 AM] Suheil - Europe: Target: 
- 3/4 posts,stories, reels  a week 
- 1-2 interviews a week ( with farmers, dao members etc..)

We might need to open a specialized guild for PR and marketing as coordination and consistency is one of the most critical points for successful long-term goals... 

it is not about making Instagram posts only. 

we need to plan: podcasts, social strategies, mini documentaries, press, a lot of production involved... unfortunately this part is not doable in a "decentralized manner"  and we need to act like a traditional company team with same level of commitment :)

[9/11/23, 7:16:02 PM] Gary Teh: Had a 60 minutes FaceTime with @5511982667030 

*key outcomes of discussion*

    - Wednesday session with president of Coopercabruca lock down steps in written assurance letter 

     - for each step in the written assurance letter, specify a day during this period here in Bahia to visit each site to ascertain they are exactly as defined 

    - have Orlantildes sign the written assurance letter after full inspection is completed

    - make photocopies of each certificate that Orlantildes has that is relevant for written assurance letter 

    - establish FSVP record for each inspection session we conducted 

    - Conduct a blind test with Orlantildes using the six samples to sync up the terminologies we use to communicate the taste for future

    - pass six numbered samples to Orlantildes for future communication purposes

    - ask orlantildes to arrange for me to attend a cacao ceremony led by MaiLan here in Bahia

    - communicate with Orlantildes that if needed Lucia will be our legal counsel here in Bahia to check through the paperwork we have compiled
[9/11/23, 7:19:38 PM] Gary Teh: Completed 1 hour dinner appointment with Lucia this evening. She is a Prospective legal counsel in Bahia 

*key outputs*

    - if required she will interface with the federal police her for legal matters. Her brother was the chief of the federal police office branch

    - her profession is law by training 

    - gave advice not to setup company first. 

    - Important to identify local that could be trusted with management of funds. 

    - Brazilian law requires deployment of USd100k for setting up local entity 

    - local entity must be headed by local director

[9/12/23, 8:50:17 AM] Gary Teh: Scheduled a meeting with Derrek from the engineering guild and @31641075825 to chat this coming Friday

*Scope of discussion*
    1. - train ChatGpt with our historical data recorded on our ledger
    2. - streamline our ledger update by automating the classification of incoming DAO member contributions
    3. - expected output of this standalone initiative
    
*Purpose*
    1. mitigate against trigger of unofficial KILL SWITCH in the event no one knows up to update the ledger anymore after Gary gets KIA (killed in action) during one of our DAO quests by being shot with a gun or stabbed with a proper knife.

    2. replace human and have AI as the independent unbiased judge

    3. further the manifesto of the Do Nothing society.

[9/12/23, 8:03:45 PM] Val Lapidus: So the only thing that changes from our original plan is that we aren't paying the co-op in DAO tokens?
[9/12/23, 8:24:03 PM] Gary Teh: Actually nothing changed at all from the current execution perspective 

We are just not going to focus our attention on building a cacao futures trading platform as some has mentioned might be an option further down the road 

One potential concern is that if all the cacao farmers pre sold their cacao on that platform we might end up not having any supplies to sell when we do ramps up our distribution effort on the USA side
[9/12/23, 8:27:42 PM] Gary Teh: Once we ramp up our US based distribution volume and when we do roll out the mobile based FSVP verification process later on, they will forced to adopt it anyways because of FDA compliance requirements

So no big deal on the adoption front
[9/12/23, 9:38:08 PM] Anupa/diya: I think that someone was me. If Mathew has said that they are partnering with another company to do the same thing . Then making two products of the same purpose is pointless.

We can maybe capitilise on it as a buy in to the agroverse community. Maybe
[9/13/23, 3:04:28 AM] Gary Teh: Please elaborate what do you mean by buy in?
[9/13/23, 10:58:03 AM] Gary Teh: Finished 5 hours of FaceTime with the cooperative members here 

*key outputs*
    - captured video footages requested by @918017107841 
    - updated and completed written assurance letter for FDA FSVP compliance 
    - conducted tasting session with cooperatives members using six samples brought. Sample #6 was strongest contestant. 

*follow up*
    - visit cacao innovation center (CIC) where independent quality assurance certification is issued 

    - visit facilities that will be processing our shipment of cacao nibs 

    - get sample of cacao nibs matching closely to taste profile of sample #6

    - arranging to attend cacao ceremony before my departure 

    - visiting sabrae office to follow up with flight ticket for @5511982667030

[9/14/23, 6:43:52 AM] Gary Teh: Moving forward, since DAO is not charging for the cacao nib samples when DAO members request them from our very limited supply, we should define clearly what we will expect in return for shipping them over. 

I feel the required reciprocal action should be something that will help move Agroverse project forward. 

As @5511982667030 suggested before, every action must necessarily enable more resources and more actions within our DAO. 

Otherwise we are not being accountable and just simply depleting DAO resources without necessarily advancing our mission. 

(PS: I still feel having the Kill Switch in place is the most effective method to focus everybody’s attention on what is important)

Let’s discuss. 🙂🙏

https://TrueSight.me/dao/agroverse/progress
[9/14/23, 8:54:02 AM] Anupa/diya: I think we need a map that will show the resources we need to make profit against the DAO s treasury. We need to make predictions so we can see if we need to go to the kill switch. If so, then we should abort shortly if we cannot be sustainable. There is no point to linger. 

However, if we continue I think we should find ways of means to sustain since the efforts are immense.I feel agroverse can help gain funding and find sustainability. We can maybe only work with AgroVerse now
[9/14/23, 8:59:19 AM] Gary Teh: *TrueSight DAO*

    - governance tokens management

*Agroverse*
   - one of the games utilizing game mechanics of TrueSight DAO 
    - uses TrueSight DAO governance tokens to track dao member contributor

townhall is where all the “board members” reside 

beer hall is where all “lesser shareholders” and “public” reside

Governance is where the  active legislative committee resides

*Agroverse*
where all the “employees” for the project reside

[9/14/23, 7:04:55 PM] Gary Teh: The Zero to One problem when it comes to go to market strategies is their lack of predictability. You will only know how effective each proposed strategy is only after resources are deployed to execute the initial iteration

Even @381642051030 mentioned this during our FaceTime the last time 

In terms of fiat resources We have USD5000++
[9/14/23, 7:08:14 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time value management - kill switch - opportunity cost on micro tasking level, hold each dao member accountable for inputs and outputs. Would be a challenge to draft the methodology and automate it.

[9/14/23, 7:23:23 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Sounds fun. I do remember you staking a large portion of your tokens for interim leadership, effectively that could be the blinds you are talking about towards an initiative.

[9/14/23, 7:34:14 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I don’t see the point of them being staked now as there is no real yield bearing mechanism in place, but eventually it will happen
[9/14/23, 7:35:05 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That’s why maybe we should start small and correlate staking - kill switch - small blind - et.
[9/14/23, 7:42:14 PM] Gary Teh: I remember having a conversation where Brian talked about the value of time prior to us raising Series A for disconnect Inc 

Prior to product market fit, You want to be as aggressive as possible time wise in the deployment of funds by ploughing through and validating your stack of hypothesis ASAP once financing becomes available and not get distracted by anything else not on the critical path. 

If all the hypothesis don’t work you know you have a dud, you can quickly free up your time and move on to more promising opportunities.
[9/14/23, 7:43:39 PM] Gary Teh: After product market fit, Reid Hoffman has his theory which he calls blitzscaling

[9/14/23, 7:45:03 PM] Gary Teh: Are you proposing that DAO members who want to continue maintaining access to our town hall stake 90% of the governance token holdings in our vault?? 🤣
[9/14/23, 7:47:25 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That could be an option and provide a tiered system for the access to the town hall
[9/14/23, 7:47:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Time sensitive of course
[9/14/23, 7:48:26 PM] Vlatko Gigov: To get access to the yield generated from dao activities you need to stake min x tokens.
[9/14/23, 7:49:48 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Puts upwards pressure (buy-in) on the token value if let’s say initiatives like agroverse are successful.
[9/14/23, 7:51:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: And from there onwards you implement the tiered system based on the rubrics and different initiatives.
[9/14/23, 7:52:43 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Neat little tiered poker game

[9/15/23, 5:07:10 AM] Suheil - Europe: there is no need at all at this level and specifically that we are still far from being on-chain eco system... right now technically everyone is staking on the excel anyways 🤷‍♂️
[9/15/23, 5:09:45 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I see your point. Although we’d have to start practicing at some point even if it is on an excel spreadsheet. Maybe the terms could be more lenient. ‎<This message was edited>

*key follow ups*
Item 1 - follow up with orlantildes to discuss and agree on the process we will use to control the threshold for the taste variance of cacao nibs shipped to USA once we lock down on the taste

Item 2 - get Orlantildes to make an introduction to Tasuijio whom they are working with to issue the cacao coin so that I could understand where he is planning to go with the technology. Explore how we could tap into it later on

Item 3 - research how mini premium chocolate gifts are presented in Whole Foods USA. Orlantildes gave samples of cacao coated almonds which could have market potential in USA

- person who is familiar with handling packing cacao nibs in Switzerland is missing

- person handling fulfillment when customer request comes in is missing
[9/15/23, 10:24:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: The fulfillment can be done via my channels
[9/15/23, 10:26:08 AM] Iwona Fluda: They don’t do the fancy packing for the products themselves, but if the products will be shipped in small e.g. envelops, we can make the magic happen.

[9/15/23, 12:14:28 PM] Tess walkowski: 20kg maximum allowed
[9/15/23, 12:15:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Also in regards to samples I would have done fine with a smaller sample .5 - 1 oz
[9/15/23, 12:16:33 PM] Tess walkowski: One doesn't need a lot to taste.

[9/16/23, 4:09:17 AM] Gary Teh: This will be considered a *serious exercise* on the use of the *export trade syndicate financing agreement* 

The 6kg is considered *property of the financiers* managed by DAO. 

Should DAO attempt to utilize any of this managed inventory for focus group purposes or recipe RnD, DAO will need to purchase the inventory from the financiers

Purchase price of inventory from the financiers will be at the rate of *cost plus standard rate markup*. 

Payment to financier can be made in fiat or governance tokens depending on the preference of the financier. Financier can exercise the right not to sell to DAO. 

These terms will be updated in the financing agreement prior to signing by both @16468233438 and myself

[9/25/23, 8:52:57 AM] Gary Teh: Outcome 3 hour FaceTime with @554888644380 

Key bottlenecks of scaling DAO 

    - information efficiency (not knowing enough for individual dao member to make an independent decision) 

    - feeling of psychological safety (fear of making the wrong decision) 

*Proposed rectification*
    - record and transcribe all conversations that ever occur within our DAO

    - feed transcriptions and chat data to LLM (AI)

    - in case of doubt, DAO member can ask LLM (AI) for clarification since it has full context if everything that is going on within DAO

[9/28/23, 11:50:19 AM] Gary Teh: I observe that new members usually feel very enthusiastic during the initial honey moon phase and would outperform in terms of contribution during the initial 90 days and sometimes end up as governors

However beyond the initial 90 day period, their enthusiasm would wane and they lost their qualifications as governors. 

To help our system select of governors who exhibit more consistency overtime, I would like to propose that during each of the quarterly seasonal rotation we pick the top 10 contributors over the past 180 days instead of the top 90 days. 

Let's submit this to a voting process and following this outcome as the new rule in the next seasonal rotation.

[10/1/23, 10:39:08 AM] Gary Teh: Just to give you an idea how serious I take appointments scheduled on my calendar 

I drove an additional 4 hours last night (after more than 24 hours on the plane) from the Los Angeles international airport specifically to the location this morning so that we could have a conducive engineering meeting 

So it is very important to take scheduled appointments you have accepted in the DAO seriously as other DAO member are actually devoting serious resources to it. 🙂🙏
[10/1/23, 10:45:00 AM] Gary Teh: As we start involving members who associate high per hour value to their time in our DAO, this becomes especially important otherwise they will churn. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 11:16:15 AM] Gary Teh: This form of hazing practice is common in the fraternity and sorority clubs in US colleagues. 

The starkest example I have gone through was the Singapore military. The very first investment required of all new recruits before the start of military boot camp was for them to shave their hair

[10/1/23, 11:16:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: We quest the tasks and simply see actions ?
[10/1/23, 11:17:22 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, even in the previous company, before we even engage the time and attention of any engineering managers to conduct the interview, the prospect was required to perform an pre-interview test.

During the interview process 5 members from the engineering team would be involved and the final person conducting the interview was the CEO to determine cultural fit. 

The hiring committee would then convene to give either the thumbs up or thumbs down. 

Now that our official first shipment is in, I feel we are on the cusp of the need to implement something like this ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 6:22:58 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 let’s bring this portion of the discussion into  @120363044542957540@g.us for further dissection
[10/1/23, 6:26:10 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't understand why we are discussing deprecating a channel, I get that their action is not cool, but it's not a reason to kill a channel.
[10/1/23, 6:54:42 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the reason is because bulk of the engineering work right now is already taking place in @120363029205885187@g.us under @15419086904 leadership

The only reason the Engineering channel was kept there (apart from legacy reasons) was because there is a potential experimental engineering undertaking that Derek (the Hero) was going to do. And it was a good idea not to clobber communications between these two projects into one channel

But since Derek has dropped out, makes a lot of sense to just drop that channel and free up slots

We will get around to that scope that Derek was going to undertake eventually but meanwhile we will just manually update our ledger. What he was going to do is not on our critical path anyways. 

I was just testing his level of commitment to our mission with a simple ask ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/23, 7:17:17 PM] Anupa/diya: One of the main things for the website is to build an end to end experience for the DAO. There is no point for the website to function as an information site. A current or potential member has to have the ability to interact and engage once they know what the site offers.

It's been build in what the user gets 
1. Awareness 
2. Engagement 
3.Interaction

Adding the ledger and token visibility is important is a key part of the experience.

The website is moving at a much faster speed with us collectively working on it. Eventually the original trusight will be clubbed with what is being created now.
[10/1/23, 7:20:53 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Glad both you and @15419086904 are fully focused on the end to end DAO member experience 🙂🙏
[10/1/23, 7:25:08 PM] Anupa/diya: The scalability of this website should be that it should do token and proposal  management, fund dispersal etc. This is just a basic foundation and all of it has to fit together. No user is going to hop through multiple sites to carry out tasks.
[10/1/23, 8:16:02 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure @15419086904 should be able to figure those out when we get there
[10/1/23, 8:18:08 PM] Anupa/diya: For sure 😁. We should build for not only thinking about the current but to scale

[10/4/23, 9:53:50 AM] Anupa/diya: I remember this conversation we had @Gary. 

As a collective strategy _ before we reach the actualization _ there are some things that individuals need to align with 

There is 
Needs and Wants
Alignment and Purpose 
Self motivation 
Self Awareness
Which eventually leads to the collective approach 

We have to be transperant about  about the fact that when someone joins this DAO, it is almost a Self initiated journey which adds to the DAO s purpose. The  incentivisation is immediate (governance tokens) but the benefit follows later (value). Every one wears a founders hat

[10/7/23, 8:11:10 AM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 and @41799155602 

For tax reporting purposes, I am thinking for the 19% cut that our DAO earns from profit generated via the sales of Agroverse cacao nibs, these should be recognized as sales and marketing expenses on the books of TrueTech Inc and paid out to the Swiss association. 

The hands of the USA government is thus prevented from touching any of the 19%. Instead the taxation is based on Swiss law instead 

If we don’t go via this route. Those 19% will end up getting booked as profit under TrueTech Inc and charged taxes by US government 

Rather than setting up a full fledge Swiss association with by laws supporting crypto currency, I would like to propose we just setup one with a bare bone version to simply hold the funds and not deal with the cryptocurrency at this early stage.

When the profit generated via the 19% cut of the profit coming in to the Swiss association becomes substantial enough for us to have funds to throw around as we wish, we can then vote for a new set of by-laws to come into effect in the Swiss association that supports cryptocurrency. 

I feel for now just a minimal odd-number directors in the association that will not block the future set of by-laws from being voted in would be fine.

In terms of directors for the new Swiss association I am thinking:

[10/7/23, 10:06:46 AM] Gary Teh: Also this will help account for all the funds we deployed from our OffChain balance for tax reduction in USA jurisdiction

The Swiss Association becomes registered as a share holder of TrueTech Inc

Then every single fiat based transaction has been accounted for in one of the taxation jurisdictions 

At the end of the day the only thing governments really care about is extracting their pound of flesh ‎<This message was edited>

[10/23/23, 9:59:43 AM] Val Lapidus: I think there should be a token incentive for monetary success at venues.  I agree it is easy to get access to a venue. The difficult part is gauging the venues viability to drive future revenue and thus it should not be a matter of oh. You got us a venue.  But more so you got us a venue and this was the result. We can attribute or find ways to attribute the resulting sales bump from a venue mechanism.  Not all should be weighed equally because they are easy to get.  But more so they should be weighed on the fact that they are targeting the right audience to make purchases
[10/23/23, 10:00:16 AM] Val Lapidus: Or targeting the right audience to get us followers
[10/23/23, 10:04:07 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense 🤩

A tiered system then.

125TDG is the base 

I am thinking additional TDG awards for 

    - per Instagram follower acquired 
    - per $$ sales generated ‎<This message was edited>

Good morning, good morning.

Hope you & your family are healthy & happy (and I hope you’re reading this with your morning coffee NOT in the early morning😊).

Please allow me to confirm our call scheduled for today (Tues. Nov 2nd) at 10:30 AM CST.

Also, I sent a one-pager explaining a Strategy I’m pitching to ING.  It may be of interest (please forgive me if I’ve already shared it).

Best,

Mujahid

[11/3/23, 5:38:48 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through how to account for funds deployed from our off chain balance for our in real life experiment 

I believe it makes sense to establish a shareholding of TrueSight DAO on the TrueTech Inc ledger for fiat funds deployed from our OffChain balance even though TrueSight DAO is right now not even a legal entity yet 

Once the Agroverse revenue model is proven TrueSight DAO should be registered as an associated in Switzerland, shareholdings in TrueTech Inc for fiat funds deployed for in real life experiments will be recorded as owned by TrueSight DAO

Right now, these shares will be ear marked as own by a soon to be incorporated Swiss Association

Plus correct me if i am wrong, if i remember correctly agroverse was exposing itself mainly in web3 events (which is good as this is the builders side ) but i don’t recall being in an event that fits the exposure of the cacao sales or target the buyer audience? again its not my fault if my memory is bad and i will forgive myself and then i will forget about it 😂

[11/8/23, 8:35:13 AM] Gary Teh: *Proposal*
In hindsight, when me and @41799155602 conceptualized the rubric framework we have allowed *legacy propaganda* to accidentally seep into the system

The effects of this propaganda is starting to become apparent as we _scale the DAO operations_ and introduce _increasing number of different *task types*_ into our ecosystem. The result is that it becomes harder and harder for new incoming members to grasp this ever increasingly complicated mental model.

The failure @31641075825 experienced explaining this mental model to Emelin yesterday is another one of those symptoms 

I would like to propose we go back to first principles and _simplify our rubric_ to just *4 rules*

- 1 human hour = 100 TDG

- 1 USD worth of expenses paid on behalf of DAO = 1TDG

- human hour spent for task based on self reporting along with completed artifact 

- payment of expenses with USD submit receipt to channels ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 10:19:05 AM] Gary Teh: That is very true.

If it is purely capitalistic, why not just do away with the whole token system and use USD?

[11/8/23, 10:23:00 AM] Gary Teh: Not true 

A lot of them that I brought contributed based on the believe of a better world that we are building 

Not based on making a lot money 

The money component is to ensure the system self sustains
[11/8/23, 10:23:59 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps some folks introduced into the ecosystem were under the belief of future promised of profits 

But my sense is retention is poor from that demographic ‎<This message was edited>
[11/8/23, 10:24:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Why can't it be both a better world and money in your pocket? Why is it just one or zero?
[11/8/23, 10:24:43 AM] Val Lapidus: Gary, you're making assumptions.  I'm in this because I want a better world.  But I also want money in my pocket and I believe the two goals are not mutually exclusive
[11/8/23, 10:25:06 AM] Gary Teh: It is not zero or one

It is which is the priority
[11/8/23, 10:25:50 AM] Val Lapidus: I don't think it matters which is the priority as long as both goals are relevant to the person contributing
[11/8/23, 10:27:09 AM] Gary Teh: It actually does. From a system perspective when one parameter is prioritized versus another the system configuration changes 

That is why we are having this poll right now
[11/8/23, 10:28:25 AM] Val Lapidus: When making money is prioritized over a better world it inherently conflicts.
[11/8/23, 10:29:00 AM] Val Lapidus: So there is no question here that a better world is the priority. But this pole is about how contribution should be measured.

[11/8/23, 10:33:17 AM] Val Lapidus: If I perform a task that is cleaning up.  It should be valued less than if I perform a task that is designing a brand.  It has nothing to do with the person that more to do with the task they are doing

[11/8/23, 10:38:34 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, they are of the same value to the DAO

That said from a capitalist perspective, there is nothing preventing DAO members from hiring someone outside to cheaply perform the task in a cheaper manner (under USD100)  while themselves getting remunerated with 100TDG for getting the task completed

It acts as a forcing function for DAO members to be creative ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 11:00:25 AM] Gary Teh: One of the reasons why to have *zero or one* is because DAO eventually needs to be _smart contract based_

Constantly requiring a _subjective human judgement_ only introduces  a _bottle neck_ in the process 

So it not only hampers the transition of DAO to a _fully smart contract based_ state, it also throws in a lot of frictional against scaling the _amount of human capital_ that came be deployed per period time effectively without compromising on the *integrity* of the system

*Integrity* is one of our core values ‎<This message was edited>
[11/8/23, 11:35:11 AM] Gary Teh: In hindsight it becomes obvious why everyone is coming to me (_the accidental subjective human judge_) for judgement on how much the value of each task is  

It also reminds me of that *one principle* @5491125130580 made the last time the governors had our FaceTime hang out

_Surface one objective rule on how tokens are awarded that is self apparent and stick to it_  then the *DAO will self mobilize*. 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 6:36:00 PM] Anupa/diya: I agree with Val on this! . We have spoken about this earlier. Some tasks take longer to execute and its also the quality of work that matters and the level of experience. We can put a cap on the task as all these factors play into it.

[11/9/23, 10:21:38 AM] Suheil - Europe: from a fully buit primary in house website that took ages to get ready suddenly back to a random wix??
[11/9/23, 10:32:23 AM] Anupa/diya: This random wix website is a stop gap till the other fully functional website is finished
[11/9/23, 10:34:03 AM] Anupa/diya: I think we should just trust the process of people working in it and follow the flow
[11/9/23, 10:34:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: agaiin thiis term “stop gap” and sentence until other fully functional is finished…. do not mean anything as :
1. base got ready and @14153000019  confirmed it here in the group and “thanked shady” publicly —> soo phase 1 obviously is ready 

Now if we neeed Moree things, we add it up to the actual one not completely delete the based…. AAs i told you in private beetween us. if you needed more specific pages and yoou cant wait for shady so then you can pop up a gap wix pages thatt youo attach on top of the main base. it a pretty simple re route liink to window page 🤷
[11/9/23, 10:35:44 AM] Suheil - Europe: a DAO is trustless when such decisions aree being voted on from dao members not just taken autonomously from couple of members between them in privaate.
[11/9/23, 10:36:09 AM] Anupa/diya: I don't think I am going to go on a public debate about this. If you wish to know about the nitty gritties about the project. It's best you set up a call with the team to make judgements which are half baked.

[11/9/23, 10:41:20 AM] Anupa/diya: In that case, We should just set up an evaluation process for every step in all the functional team
[11/9/23, 10:42:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: On multiple occasions you are mentioning to me that its a gap and until website will finish.

But what you are not getting is because you did this move wiithout consulting the expert that built the website dev and that is taking care of the website so you completely lost him and there is nothing that is “getting ready” to be waiting for in the first place 🤷 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/23, 10:44:16 AM] Anupa/diya: I am really sorry to say for someone who is not even in the project and has no idea what has been going - these are pretty strong. Please do your background research.
[11/9/23, 10:46:17 AM] Suheil - Europe: if you have found other engineer working on the website then yes i am deeply sorry its not my fault information did not get to me...
[11/9/23, 10:49:26 AM] Anupa/diya: I think you have no idea to what you are saying. Please get your facts right. If you were tracking the work, there was an urgent need for the onboarding process to start. This is just to full fill that i need. If you want please bring this up with the DAO, if you have any other issues.
[11/9/23, 10:51:35 AM] Suheil - Europe: i dont have any issue. I am just informing you that if you are waiting for something code development website related matter then there is a miss understanding between you and shadi … as what i understood that first version of website got ready and for him there are zero justifications to shut it down….
[11/9/23, 10:53:54 AM] Anupa/diya: I really feel you should know more about what is going on before you charge at people without knowing what is going on completely. I am sure we are all here for the benefit to a larger cause and to something that we are all proud so lets keep it at that.
[11/9/23, 10:57:10 AM] Suheil - Europe: i did not charge you anything and i am sorry if you feel that way.
It is simple clear 
You tell me “ i am waiting for shadi to finish"
Shadi had no idea what was going on until i poked him asking why the website is down...

Hence, miss communication.

UNLESS you have other coder working it out with you and that its from that person that you are waiting newer webste…. as of shady he is not ,simple.

nothing personal just informing you about this gap and maybe u should clarify it out with shady ‎<This message was edited>

[11/14/23, 6:47:28 AM] Gary Teh: Main difference 

_*Legacy system*_ - you end up deferring to me on which category your contribution belongs to 🤣

*_New system_* - you submit how many hours your effort was and that gets tokenized 100TDG per hour. 

_*Primary similarities*_
In either case each task should not be above 5000TDG. Life goes on without me 

If it is. Break it down into smaller tasks

_*Key insights*_
A DAO member working full time for DAO 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and 4 weeks a month and 12 months per year ends up making exactly the same amount in TDG a software engineer working in Silicon Valley would in USD

So the rates are quite reasonable from my perspective. I see us all as system hackers 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

Finished facetime with @41799155602 

*Agenda*
    
_*Agroverse*_
    - Setting up of supply chain in Switzerland
    - Shipping of first 3kg cargo to Switzerland warehousing facility
    - Shipping of 2 bags samples to Switzerland

_*SunMint*_

    - role as validator of sustainable practise along supply chain
    - SunMint as node operator of TrueChain where notarization records for steps along the supply chain are stored

*Time Taken: 1 hour*
[11/15/23, 3:39:31 PM] Gary Teh: Closed out the following shipment financing contract for all financiers

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20231002%20-%20Export%20trade%20financing%20syndicate%20agreement%20.pdf

*Time Taken: 40  minutes*
[11/15/23, 5:07:11 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the outcome of this discussion is that I will end up spending sometime in Europe early next year as me and @41799155602 work together to setup the European section of our Agroverse supply chain network
[11/15/23, 5:21:59 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposed governance token management protocol*

The purpose of this protocol is to discourage excessive speculation on our governance tokens in the open market once it gets listed on Centralized exchanges while at the same time capitalize on market fluctuations to increased our fiat netbook value per issued governance token ratio



*_Rules_*
    - _*Rule 1*_: every quarter DAO will make provisions to increase governance tokens in circulation by 25% of what is already in circulation last day of the previous quarter. 

    - _*Rule 2*_: Full amount might not end up being circulated in the market if no exceptional price ranges present themselves 

    - _*Rule 3*_: DAO will make open market purchase as and when market value at which governance token is traded at falls below USDT net book value. 

    - _*Rule 4*_: DAO will make open market sales of governance tokens up to the total provision specified for market circulation as and when market value per token exceeds the minimal of either USDT1 or USDT net book value per token



*_Conclusion_* 
This protocol for governance token management when strictly adhered to in the long haul is anti-dilutive on nature. 

It has the effect of discouraging excessive speculation activities beyond desirable price range both on the upside and the downside 

The muting of speculative components in open market pricing of DAO governance token help curtail distractions DAO governance token holders might otherwise experience away from daily practice of Satseva

    - China’s monetary policy which helped them tide through the 2008 financial crisis unscathed ‎<This message was edited>

@918017107841 we should extend our website with a page that provides people with instructions on how they can transfer the USDT they receive into their bank account after they cash out 

Also perhaps a form on that page that allows people to insert their name, WhatsApp or email address and Solana wallet address they want their USDT to be transferred to once they have cashed out their governance tokens at the prevailing exchange rate

[11/17/23, 9:14:48 AM] Gary Teh: I spent time thinking about *_WHY*_ a *_chocolate artisan_* in the Agroverse network will not want to become their own importer if and when their own operations scale up

Fundamentally it boils down to fear of *_legal repercussions*_. 

Most of these folks will be mum and pop localized operations. 

If they decide to also handle importing as part of their operations if and when FDA does an audit and surface issues with the Agroverse supply chain into USA then they will be dragged into it and their mom and pop side of the business will suffer as well. 

In that regard TrueTech Inc is the *_ultimate underwriter of legal risk*_… or more specifically *_me*_. If anything ever happens regarding the Agroverse supply chain into USA, and someone needs to go to jail, that person will be me. And it will definitely not be the first time something like this happened before (_after being mistaken for being an insurgent in Xinjiang region of China_).  🤣

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/

For a person with a more conventional domestic arrangement like someone who has a family, such an experience will be very devastating to the rest of their family members if and then one of their family members get locked up in jail. 

However in my case, everyone in the immediate family is keenly aware of this natural inclination towards *_maximized calculated risk taking*_ in my DNA hence they won’t be devasted or even surprised if and when one of these usual exceptions occur. 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/17/23, 9:16:05 AM] Gary Teh: The other dimension as that a *_mom and pop*_ cannot easily replicate is the decentralized nature of the DAo community which makes it exceptionally suited for sourcing in unconventional locations in the world.

[11/22/23, 7:13:01 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 for foundation requirements please have a chat with @41765663130 

We spoke about having Peace on Snow (a Swiss association) being a manager of our unissued governance tokens 

Let him know what your needs are regarding getting our governance tokens listed with LATOKENs and explore if Peace on snow will be able to fulfill the requirements 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/22/23, 9:10:21 PM] Gary Teh: *Proposal to reduce noise on WhatsApp app and increase retention rate*

I noticed that there are quite a lot of folks who have not *_clicked in to visit any of our community WhatsApp channels for more than 90 days*_

From my perspective if a community member has churned, it doesn’t make any sense to keep _spamming_ their phone with messages they are obviously no longer interested in

Also now that we are allowing people to *_submit via our community WhatsApp channels USDT cash out requests for their TDG governance tokens held*_, this seem like a great opportunity to filter out folks who have churned for various reasons while at the same time gamify retention. 

This has the side effect of also making it more likely active community members get a response when they reach out to any of the remaining community members in our channel for help as the latter folks are obviously still interested to keep updated in matters regarding our DAO and be more inclined to help than folks who have already churned. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/23/23, 5:23:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: after a quick review of all documentation , here is my analysis why we are not ready  or should not list now.

1. requires 6-8k fiat budget (after effort and discount from our lovely contact at LA token )
2. true sight eco system becomes more vulnerable to idiot hackers. (just got hacked 2 weeks ago and hackers stole only tokens that are convertible fiat , did not touch utility tokens )  hence , let’s keep the true sight token as a utility token and internal cash out /cash in control until the eco system is less vulnerable 🤷
3. listing on exchange will require heavy routine legal operations/ reporting/ declarations aka  extra costs…
[11/23/23, 5:27:23 AM] Suheil - Europe: I would lilke to request tokenize contribution of total  3 hours including: going over all documents, research and 1 zoom call with craig : listing manager at LA token

[11/23/23, 8:11:50 AM] Val Lapidus: Gary, I would like to propose an amendment to this vote.  Please add a third option which is we need to start exploring other mechanisms of communication because noise is inherent to WhatsApp.  We need channels for different topics within each guild.  Something like discord or slack
[11/23/23, 8:12:44 AM] Anupa/diya: I had suggested Slack earlier . I feel all active projects should be moved to Slack
[11/23/23, 8:14:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Personally, I have fatigue from running this on WhatsApp.  I have to scroll through hundreds of messages that have nothing to do with me to find the message that I'm looking for. Have to keep the mental load of if I want to find a previous message that was important. I have to remember who sent it or remember specific contextual clues for it from it in order to search for it. It's exhausting,

[11/23/23, 8:28:38 AM] Val Lapidus: If I start another channel I'm not willing to accept any other messages here. I will stop checking this for him and I will no longer follow anything so this needs to be a group decision.  This cannot be a fragmented element of the DAO
[11/23/23, 8:29:16 AM] Val Lapidus: This needs to be a decision completely agreed on by the governors
[11/23/23, 10:03:23 AM] Gary Teh: It is your *Autonomy* 🙂🙏

_PS: what I observe is the herd behavior tends to follow DAO members exercising personal *Autonomy* in executing critical functions in our DAO._

_After analyzing all the different functions, the most *critical ones* are_ 

    - _ledger update_ 
    - _fiat funding_
    - _supply chain management_

_If there is only one DAO member exercising *Autonomy* in any of these, then the DAO becomes centralized around that specific function_ ‎<This message was edited>

[11/24/23, 2:42:43 PM] Gary Teh: Johnson did surface *_Sushiswap*_ as a possible option last year as a DEX last year 

Did a 10 minute research at the codebase level, *_Uniswap*_ might be more suitable for Ethereum ERC20 token types once we migrated our TDG governance tokens over from Solana to Ethereum 

*_Uniswap*_ allows for Automated market making and also liquidity pool staking using _USDT/ETH/BTC_. 

Assuming @16468233438 @41799155602 @12245781775 and @31641075825 can handle all the *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops_* amongst themselves without my further involvement in that area for both USA and Europe, once I am done with my 21 day meditation retreat I can finally drop my *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops*_ hat and put on my *_Engineering*_ hat and do some actual smart contract coding after a hiatus of slightly more than to a year while getting my hands dirty in  the *_Biz Dev/Biz Ops*_ department ‎<This message was edited>

Actually if you are really keen on Slack you should just go ahead and revive this slack channel 🙂🙏
https://join.slack.com/t/truesight-group/shared_invite/zt-27r7rowr6-NBR58UmtHKNen2jBZRKq~A

Neil (DAO member and former engineering manager at Edmodo) set it up when he and his brother started working on some engineering related tasked. 

Richard was active on it as well when he was helping build out the frontend UI of Edgar. 

Gautam (_Technical staff contextual Ai_) was also hanging out in that channel when we were discussing how USA college students understood Metaverse as well as exploring various implementations of Zero Knowledge proofs on blockchain for the prediction market project from last year

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_LAioUeYvbSuuCuiPCd87t4VLx_PkqXBn3ggIn8Fxs/edit#heading=h.efqfwk7iwt0y 

From my perspective it might actually be easier to poll slack for messages to automate contribution tokenization than it is for WhatsApp. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/26/23, 7:26:01 PM] Gary Teh: *key constrains to consider*

    - slack charges after a certain number of people joins

   - slack does not allow access to historical messages older than 3 months without paying 

*_proposal for you if you are keen_*

Go ahead and start it as a side experiment with folks you work closely with. 

If it gains traction great. 

If not, it was a cheap experiment

[11/29/23, 4:07:48 PM] Gary Teh: Its usually the very last message that they will have access to before they get booted out 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:10:04 PM] Iwona Fluda: I mean writing to everyone a message like this before booting them out: 

Hi! We are developing super fast here & working on new community rules now. Please be informed of... XYZ & the consequences of not being active are... XYZ.
[11/29/23, 4:11:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: People have different reasons for not being much involved and the fact that they weren't over the last 3 months doesn't mean they wouldn't like to be involved in the future. A transparent communication on this change will help everyone.
[11/29/23, 4:12:16 PM] Iwona Fluda: and definitely will help in building long-term relationships with people.
[11/29/23, 4:12:39 PM] Gary Teh: The rules will have been published in the @120363044914723610@g.us channel 

Perhaps you might want to craft the copy when the policy gets published once the voting period for this incoming policy is over? 🙂🙏
[11/29/23, 4:13:27 PM] Gary Teh: That is true. 

Nothing preventing them from joining the @120363041505997891@g.us again since they are governance token holders
[11/29/23, 4:13:55 PM] Iwona Fluda: It is great that it has been published. I think we had this discussion once: How many of us read the Terms & Conditions of every community we are joining? I guess: none.
[11/29/23, 4:14:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Sending everyone an email or a message with this information before enforcing this decision will help people to rethink their involvement.
[11/29/23, 4:16:54 PM] Iwona Fluda: I'm not sure if that would be helpful. Once trust is broken, then is broken; not sure how many people would even consider coming back. 

Just speaking from experience as I have run private communities over the last few years, and everything there is based on trust and mutual understanding.
[11/29/23, 4:30:05 PM] Gary Teh: There is also the other perspective too

For folks who hasn’t been in these channels for a long time, sending them a direct message regarding something that they no longer care about will just come across as spam in their inbox
[11/29/23, 4:33:59 PM] Iwona Fluda: We don't know if they don't care about it. Depending on the message it can be also taken as a great reminder to them that it exists.
[11/29/23, 4:34:43 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps the middle way would be the *_governor*_ who volunteers to do the pruning please exercise your *_autonomy*_ by using your discretion 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:35:38 PM] Iwona Fluda: and some people might be not interested at all, some might be grateful, some pissed. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we don't exclude them at the first place.
[11/29/23, 4:36:32 PM] Iwona Fluda: Im happy to do so, send me the list of the people not being involved including their emails or WhatsApp numbers, and I will make this happen.

[11/29/23, 4:43:43 PM] Iwona Fluda: One question: we are talking about the people in this channel, right? @14153000019 ?
[11/29/23, 4:45:05 PM] Gary Teh: The folks whom we have email addresses they would be listed on the *_contact information*_ tab of *_our ledger*_

Those that we don’t, we have some of their LinkedIn, Instagram or WhatsApp on the tab ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:47:03 PM] Gary Teh: In all 7 WhatsApp channels 

The reason why this clean up is because I know alot of folks use WhatsApp for communicating with their families and very close friends, so having undesired messages on their WhatsApp feels way more intrusive than on their LinkedIn, email, Instagram…

Hence the reason why I really want to minimize this intrusion into their private space ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 4:48:39 PM] Iwona Fluda: On this list, just a small group of people has their phone number or email address...
[11/29/23, 4:49:27 PM] Iwona Fluda: This is an assumption, we don't know if that's true. Unless you run a survey on this and asked them privately about their needs and preferences.
[11/29/23, 4:52:08 PM] Gary Teh: That would be very interesting 

I know a lot of them don’t even bother to respond to my private 1 on 1 message until months later (_on the average six months_)🤣

[11/29/23, 4:59:21 PM] Gary Teh: I think another creative way to solve the problem is that we should really become more discreet about who we let in to our channels

the USA government has a shutdown scenario that is often reported in the news

when our *_DAO runs out of liquidity*_, the following will happen 

    - TrueSight.me wix account shutdown 

    - Agroverse.shop Wix account shutdown 

    - Stamps.com account shutdown

    - Amazon.com seller account shutdown

[12/2/23, 4:36:01 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: That will be great! We have a bounty harvest this season.

[12/4/23, 12:34:49 PM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan for Agroverse sales related activities*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions to commercial buyer 

    - utilize existing 4 rules rubric based system without introducing additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the initial sale from buyer

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO, DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call for coordination_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator but not the role of sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a buyer. All prior listed rules (1-4) applies
[12/4/23, 12:36:09 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Have this set of rules come into effect?
‎OPTION: Yes! It offers proper incentive for sales related activities while keeping tokenomics balanced (2 votes)
‎OPTION: No! Why so much new rules!?! (0 votes)
[12/4/23, 4:49:40 PM] Val Lapidus: Is this closing door on any fiat compensation or is that still available to sellers
[12/4/23, 6:31:12 PM] Gary Teh: Totally closed
[12/5/23, 4:44:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I think it's better to involve the first round of decision making with people who are actively working in the project and then it can come the DAO
[12/5/23, 7:08:35 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with @918017107841 hence why I have proposed a debate in the agroverse guild to flush out the best suitable incentives model for scaling a FMCG. This current proposal doesn’t reflect the complete value chain.
[12/5/23, 7:09:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I vote for n.3: current proposal not suitable for agroverse business model.
[12/5/23, 8:29:53 AM] Gary Teh: Since this does impact the distribution of governance tokens and hence voting rights within our DAO. 

The town hall is a more appropriate place for this debate to take place 

@120363044028036610@g.us is discussions for day to day operational matters only 

*_Analogy*_
    - @120363044028036610@g.us is the factory floor where workers build stuff

    - Townhall is where all the board of directors (general assembly) sit to discuss about policy matters impacting the entire DAO 

_PS: you don’t cook dinner in the toilet_
[12/5/23, 8:47:19 AM] Vlatko Gigov: No problem, we can discuss anywhere: 

What is the commission charged for processing payments on the agroverse shop? 

What is the commission charged by Amazon for selling products on their platform? 

Why should there be a discrimination against a human sales force if other mediums are adequately compensated? 

What is the incentive of the 46 other town hall members to actually act as a board of directors instead of just the empty floscule about board of directors exercising governance rights based on their tokens. 

How will you incentivise a decentralized sales force other than with $ sales commissions? If the sales rep wishes to relinquish the $ commission and obtain gov tokens that should be at their discretion.
[12/5/23, 8:47:54 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Otherwise this whole exercise becomes like the good ol’ communist order: we are all equal but some are more equal than the others. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 8:49:44 AM] Anupa/diya: The reason for proposing is that the internal team will be much for equipped to take decisions for matters that they work on rather in a whatsapp group where people will have to invest time reading, doing some sort of research if they lack information and then make decision. Which I clearly don't see happening
[12/5/23, 8:56:08 AM] Vlatko Gigov: FMCG scaling is much more different than selling software products. Also the relatives of our organisation do not allow for a salaried sales force. Even if the ales force was on a salary base there would still be % remuneration for successful sales. In the current case, the remuneration proposed only cators to a select few BOD members.
[12/5/23, 8:56:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: “We are all equal but some are more equal than the others”
[12/5/23, 9:01:04 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess the questions that we need to answer are:

1. How do we incentivise a decentralised sales force (Herbalife model maybe IDK)

2. How do we make sure everyone’s efforts are adequately and appropriately compensated? 

3. Your proposed model only allows for one thing to happen: a huge DUMP or even worse a rug pull from the largest token holders or the treasurer, if you remember our exciting trip in Dubai and the experts… 🤣
I hope your toilet analogy is not n.3 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:03:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @everyone these are very exciting times of this DAO, being there nearly from the beginning it’s a great experience. Many have told us that things will disintegrate much sooner. That we will never get this far because: there is not huge capital from a coin offering to incentivise contributions against or there isn’t a liquid token to exchange for.
[12/5/23, 9:04:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I’m open to other suggestions as long as we move slightly away from far left economic models. 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:07:28 AM] Vlatko Gigov: But liquidity will happen if we develop a sound economic model and incentives structures. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:49:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: By the way I am arguing here against my case since I hold second or third largest tdg purse, which is pointless if I don’t have an army of motivated and incentivised sales force to scale organic agroverse products… ie bringing dollarz to the treasury ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:50:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The other route would be let’s do an ICO and hope not to get flagged by the SEC if our bizz models fail and we deplete the treasury…
[12/5/23, 9:51:20 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I would always choose structured organic growth before a crowdfunding operation.
[12/5/23, 9:51:57 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Then once we have stable revenue models we can do a coin offering.
[12/5/23, 9:53:44 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I guess you are right @14153000019 to discuss these matters here: 1. Governance, 2. Treasury Management, 3. Sales force incentives
[12/5/23, 12:05:25 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to start incentivizing people with Fiat.  issuing tokens for me personally is fine.  but I think we can get a higher quality of sales people by giving them a monitary incentive to sell the product. And don’t get all flustered that most people are not here to be capitalists.  We are selling to capitalists, we should probably employ a few that understand the motivations.
[12/5/23, 12:07:17 PM] Val Lapidus: And as I’ve stated previously the monitory incentive to sell can be collected by any one, regardless of where they live, there is no barrier to entry to do this job, and there is nothing to prevent you from doing it.
[12/5/23, 12:28:23 PM] Gary Teh: We should test this hypothesis 

*Proposed test*

Recruit 10 test subjects to do sales 

5 subjects granted fiat only incentive 

5 subjects granted TDG only incentive 

All 10 subjects granted the same script to use to sell

Each subject required to generate their own sales leads 

Measure sales performance (average sales generated per subject) of these 2 groups over a 90 day period 

Group with the higher average sales revenue generated is *winning variant*

Roll out variant into production environment

_PS: someone else will need to run this experiment. I am exercising my *autonomy* not to do it as it is boring for me and I will be utilizing my time to do something else 🙂🙏_
[12/5/23, 12:44:21 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what needs to be proved out here. Gary.  And I'm going to practice my autonomy by not doing this and urge my fellow governor's not to do this as well. Human kind has been incentivized by money for hundreds of years. What? What am I proving?  So far our sales have been zero.  People have always had the autonomy to go and sell the product.  But have not utilized it.
[12/5/23, 12:45:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The logical option would be for sales agents to exercise autonomy: whether they want to receive $ or tokens or a mix of the two.
[12/5/23, 12:46:54 PM] Gary Teh: They don’t have the tools to sell

No tools no sales
[12/5/23, 12:47:36 PM] Vlatko Gigov: https://mapmycustomers.me/2021/10/13/average-sales-rep-compensation-by-industry/
[12/5/23, 12:47:44 PM] Val Lapidus: Has anyone actually volunteered and asked for the tools to sell?
[12/5/23, 12:48:21 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Well the simple deck / product information sheet hasn’t been prepared. ‎<This message was edited>

[12/5/23, 12:51:39 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Yes the sales deck should just one page in the pres deck.
[12/5/23, 12:52:19 PM] Val Lapidus: If they are highly motivated, they can build whatever materials they want to sell the product
[12/5/23, 12:52:31 PM] Vlatko Gigov: The story existed, and it’s a good one. Now that we have the momentum we shouldn’t give up..
[12/5/23, 12:52:39 PM] Val Lapidus: They have a forum within agroverse to ask questions
[12/5/23, 12:53:10 PM] Val Lapidus: This is an autonomous out organization and should function as one.
[12/5/23, 12:53:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: When @918017107841 was in the agroverse guild things were running a tad bit smoother. Al thought that is not her scope.
[12/5/23, 12:55:24 PM] Val Lapidus: There is no one and nothing stopping the people wanting to sell from selling.  If they need materials to sell, they need to build the materials, not wait for me, or Gary, or any one else to be the bottleneck.  Autonomy is defined as: the right or condition of self-government.
[12/5/23, 12:58:34 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Makes sense to me. As I am illiterate in design work, I do exercise my autonomy to seek for help
[12/5/23, 12:58:35 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:09:31 PM] Gary Teh: Most of them don’t even know how the product actually looks and feel like 

It is very hard to pitch a physical product to a buyer without having one in your hand

The first thing I notice anyone does when they pick up the product is to put it to their nose and breathe in ecstasy 

Kind of hard to replicate that buying experience without the actual product in hand 🤣
[12/5/23, 1:10:15 PM] Val Lapidus: If they need the product, they should ask
[12/5/23, 1:10:40 PM] Val Lapidus: The only one who’se asked is Rodney and Vigi
[12/5/23, 1:10:56 PM] Gary Teh: And they did 

@41799155602 and @19209806391 

I know @18175503434 was asking about it when we chatted
[12/5/23, 3:12:52 PM] Vlatko Gigov: For me the deck / product spec is more important. Retailers know what nibs are they don’t know why our nibs differentiate from the non-organic competitors. Agroverse story is strong. Most of that info is in the website… ‎<This message was edited>

Please apologize to her privately 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 9:31:52 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's we take Autonomy has an example. Everyone has their own idea of what autonomy looks like  

In a project, if there are set actions given then those must be followed. if someone is doing something and someone else comes in and says it's my autonomy to change things. That's not on and it's a waste of time. 

Autonomy has to be defined for each project according to me because the variables differ from case to case.
[12/5/23, 9:35:05 PM] Anupa/diya: The people working within the project can decide what autonomy looks like for them and for larger issues it can be referenced to the DAO.
[12/5/23, 9:39:01 PM] Vlatko Gigov: That is why the contributions rubric was the closest thing to autonomy imo. I understand it’s a nightmare to keep track of the variables, but it only makes sense to appropriate quality metrics instead of quantity (# of hours)
[12/5/23, 9:43:42 PM] Anupa/diya: There can be sections - work remuneration past and present / work ethics/ deliverables/ code of conduct/ and so forth . This will also come under the governance. The main structure can be sub divided to small groups.
[12/5/23, 10:03:56 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 and @918017107841 

Please feel free to exercise your autonomy to work together to define and then propose a new rubric for voting into effect. 

I am open to exercising my autonomy to stand aside and refrain from further contribution to DAO until the new rubric has been proposed and voted on 🙂🙏

_PS: from my perspective this is part of DAO’s process of maturing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/5/23, 10:11:41 PM] Anupa/diya: I don't think this should be the case. Let it run as it is for now till a group of active members can collectively draw up something defined

Two people from the DAO  might not reflect the voice of what the DAO wants. The governors table along with any other members can sort this out

There are a lot of things that need to be discussed.Rubric is one of them.
[12/5/23, 10:12:15 PM] Anupa/diya: Rubric has to taken in a lot of aspects and it has to be a collective decision so I wait for that group to be formed.
[12/6/23, 3:12:58 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe there should be a definition for the workflow and values for each specific project and people inside agree to that if not, they leave.
‎[12/6/23, 4:48:24 AM] Gary Teh: ‎<attached: 00002721-PHOTO-2023-12-06-04-48-23.jpg>
[12/6/23, 4:57:53 AM] Tomas - Offchain: the questions about engagement, ghosting, rules, behaviors, incentives, and payments are still in the air, Maybe ghosting here was an answer to a specific situation or a wrongly defined problem. Maybe it would be valuable to understand what happened to understand which rules work better. I would ask why did it happen to understand the root cause a little more. I agree that waiting for something that undermines our autonomy goes against the core principles.

[12/6/23, 8:05:04 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense, that is because your entire kharma within the ecosystem is recorded on the chain

Reddit for example does not allow members with exceptionally low kharma to contribute in certain things 

From my perspective, if a member’s kharma point is too low, I will be hesitant in allowing member to undertake task on critical path in projects even if member volunteers to do so

If you haven’t noticed already, new incoming members reaching out to me offering to help are often first assigned to task that are not on the critical path. 

The purpose of this is do an integrity verification

[12/6/23, 5:54:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel we need to update the governance model. A lot of it comes under for ethics and code of conduct. Deciding on actions over a poll on whatspp is slightly hasty 🤣 I feel there has to be a state and agreed document by the group where all or these are stayed and with outcomes decided for the most and then the voting should come into play.i don't think we can so lightly state strike outs. 

One might not even agree to the strike outs since it was not even stated by them so where is the autonomy in that. I don't think anyone is at the position to state a strike out even for themselves because it has to be community led and not dependent on one person and their decision.

One should be allowed to propose a strike out or any other rule, the town hall decide and then decide. 

When there is governors all categories should be voted or discussed for future voting

[12/6/23, 10:26:19 PM] Anupa/diya: The second conversation which I think that needs to start is the participation of the community. Since the participation is low with the given numbers. We should try and look at what the community wants. Everyone in the beer hall has so much to offer and the key question is how can they find value in the community and vice versa. 

Not everyone will be invested in the currents projects. So how do we mobilize the community. Cypher defense days  were great with so much activity

Right now they are myself, you, @19209806391 and @12245781775

_*Location of code base*_
- https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/contribution_scoring/blob/main/Sandbox.ipynb



_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQg09aFTlyUNez3w1GHX4GCQ6b1P3jaUz52z29TUHcw/edit#gid=2120247626



_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels

[12/14/23, 6:17:12 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks!!

let me know when you have withdrawn the brazilian Rei from our USA bank account to cover R$299 you have fronted using your own money 

DAO is right now owing you money and you are incurring loses from you funds not being able to deployed back to your personal investment account 

Thank you for helping facilitate that 🙂🙏
[12/15/23, 10:19:14 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030

I think the right thing to do in this case would be to compensate you for the interest losses using our treasury balance for facilitating this transaction even though you could have just ignore our request for help. 

I am aware amongst all the DAO members here there are those that are not short on cash to finance their personal day to day expenses and you definitely not one of them. 

When you make the withdrawal in Brazilian R$ please also withdraw the amount for interest you would have otherwise made had the loan amount you provided to the DAO stayed deployed in your own investment account. 

If anyone else in the TownHall please state your case now otherwise  we will just leave it as that 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Hook that WhatsApp account into our groups

WhatsApp forwards all the messages received via that account to our Python server in the cloud 

Python server in the cloud calls OpenAi to determine if message is someone submitting a contribution and how much TDG score should be awarded if it is 

For every message forwarded to WhatsApp account, we are charged 

This is just speculation at the moment not event sure if we could even hook the account into our WhatsApp groups

Until further notice, Official website is now the one we have running on Wix

_PS: it would have been helpful had he clarified his status sooner. I observed his lack of response to requests recently ever since he started his job was causing frustration on @918017107841’s end. Fortunately on my end, it was not on the critical path_

_glad we have now gained clarity on his status and can move on_

_Thank you for exercising patience during this period @918017107841_

_*exercise of empathy* can sometimes simply mean informing a fellow DAO member of status change at the soonest possible time so as not to leave person waiting 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

[1/3/24, 7:18:21 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the conversation had with @41799155602 today was regarding fundraising 

We technically don’t really have much use for the funds 

What we really need now is relationship that potential investors have with the distributors and retailers more so than we need their money 

Taking investor money is more for the purpose of forcing them to put their money where their mouth is. Literally tapping into the *_sunk cost fallacy cognitive bias*_ and the *_consistency cognitive bias*_. 

*_Sunk cost fallacy*_
Once your money is parked here, it is less likely you will invest your relationship in another competing project which is basically like shooting yourself in the foot. 

This is an effective way of keeping out copycat projects that attempt to replicate the same route with the same set of investors 

VCs have this policy where they do not invest in another competing company once they have placed their bet on what they think is a winning horse in the space.

And those with integrity will inform incoming teams of their existing positions before clearing saying no to them. 

*_Consistency bias*_
Once you said yes to a small ask, it is more likely you will say yes to a bigger ask later one. As For smaller ask later on, go figure…

Also a slightly larger treasury also tend to give a sense of formidability which has the effect of discouraging other copy cats when they see the size of the balance sheet. Though technically having a strong balance does not always lead to more effective execution and at times serve more as a distraction… I could personally attest to this… it is much better for DAO members to be forced to be scrappy and justify the use of every single dollar in our vault than to be irresponsibly throwing DAO funds around chasing after bullshit ideas (… _and become the next SBF_… )

that is why our DAO’s treasury till now continues to looks so broke from the perspective of an unsuspecting outsider 🤔🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/3/24, 7:51:28 PM] Gary Teh: Once the Swiss association is setup, the fiat funds deployed from our DAO treasury to TrueTech Inc to help setup Agroverse infrastructure in USA will issued as shares from TrueTech Inc to the Swiss association at the price of 1USD per share

@41799155602 will be representing the Swiss association entity by joining the board of directors on TrueTech Inc 

@41799155602 will also be a director sitting on the board of the Swiss association (_since he is the only Swiss that has volunteered for the board so far and has consistently contributed during the life cycle of our DAO as we came to each critical checkpoint along our journey_)

I would propose a nomination and election process for the remaining directors that will sit on the board of the Swiss association

Total number of directors sitting on the board should be voted upon by DAO general assembly members ‎<This message was edited>
[1/4/24, 1:04:54 AM] Suheil - Europe: the most important step with creating a “mother” swiss association is to build strong mother legal framework.

we need to fundraise to :
- set up legal framework
- ⁠hire operations team to scale agroverse  ops: sales, marketing and design 
- ⁠set up the required tech environment ( lessons to learn from the failing website project —> we ended up over spending on something that still doesnt work 🤷 decentralied autonomy iis beautiful but for managing a project someone should be responsible.

List our governance tokens there sell the tokens to the people trading on LATOKEN

Use the funds for whatever you have in mind 

Send me your date of birth brother. We need to do a fortune telling session to decipher from the heavens if you are the general that the cosmic universe has sent us to undertake the Herculean quest of leading this vast army DAO is raising funds for (_now you need to grow longer hair and build more muscles 🤣_)

When I did my decipher, the heaven signals I am just a nobody wayfarer. The army needs to be lead by someone who has the following cosmic energy in his stars

[1/22/24, 8:41:37 PM] Gary Teh: After rounds of discussion this seems to be the set of hypothesis that @120363045796860099@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to utilize waste collected from the surrounding area to turn a barren piece of land into a productive one 

- ⁠productivity could be achieved by systematic application of circular economy principles 

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of soil regeneration through the use of waste material (_courtesy of @41765737357_)

- ⁠productivity could be in the form of permaculture techniques used by the indigenous on regenerated soil

- ⁠productivity could be achieved via construction of off grid data center facility where bulk if not all of the materials are scavenged from elsewhere at a fraction of the commercial cost if not for free

- ⁠productivity could be achieved with minimal deployment of fiat resources
[1/22/24, 10:04:54 PM] Gary Teh: And this seems to be the set of hypotheses that @120363044028036610@g.us aims to validate

- ⁠crowdsourcing can yield produces that restore communities and regenerates environment 

- ⁠integrity can be crowdsourced to tackle existing fraud in shipping industry which has caused banks to stop issuing Letter of Credits
[1/22/24, 10:09:01 PM] Gary Teh: The set of hypotheses we seek to validate with @120363208199596306@g.us 

- alpha signal can be generated when people from diverse geographical location and industrial background are pooled together for discussions

- ⁠AI like ChatGpt can be used to synthesize signals to generate a well crafted report

- ⁠outsiders will perceived value in alpha generated 

- ⁠outsiders will be willing to pay to gain access to alpha genersted via crowdsourced discussions coupled with AI synthesis

- Integrity without compromising on Privacy

- ⁠A well defined ethical framework within which members can operate with full autonomy 

Regarding point 1: this has been actively addressed

Regarding point 2: this is part of the reason why there has been a recent heavy influx of new members into our @120363044542957540@g.us. Bulk of these new members are steeped in various spiritual traditions and ethical frameworks.

- ⁠*match* is when self actualization path of applicant and needs of guild for next 90 days coincides

- ⁠during every equinox/solstice, existing guild members are invited to share their personal 90 day action plan to further the mission of the guild 

- ⁠if there is existing guild member can’t figure an action plan for themselves they can invite other guild members to propose an action plan for them which they might feel enthusiastic about 

- ⁠if there is not match to be had existing guild member are invited to join the guild again in the future when there is a match meanwhile free up slots for other members who might have a match

[2/10/24, 8:14:00 AM] Gary Teh: It’s up to the members within each guild to determine what is most effective for themselves. 

From my perspective I know for sure @120363044028036610@g.us and @120363045796860099@g.us will be ran this way if and when policy comes into effect. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[2/10/24, 10:02:20 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this is a looser more decentralized version of the Sprint protocol commonly used in teams using agile 

I observed @33652866472 attempting to use Sprint in House of Balance last year. It did not turn out very well. 

From my perspective, the primary reason is because the required level of effort coordination between various team members in a sprint as well as the frequency of the cadence is too high considering everyone has their own daily jobs to attend to. 

From my experience, running product development teams, when members are very experienced and senior in their domain, the best approach is to start by first sitting with them to determine what is the epic quest they feel strongly for, and then help them define their own goal they want to achieve at the end of this epic quest of theirs. Thereafter work backwards and break down the quest into smaller chunks. Finally just get out of the way, but periodically do a check in with them. 

For quests that require tighter coordination between team members, it’s best to colocate the team members for the duration of the quest. 

Back in the previous startup we had this concept called the _war room_ where the entire product development team was colocated in the same room for an duration until a very specific (_usually very critical_) milestone is hit (_usually a product launch or a major crisis is averted_). 

I understood from Brian (_another DAO member_) when Google wave was being launched way back then, the entire product team were shipped over to Sydney and then colocated in an office till it finally got launched. Back when I was on his team a few startups ago, when we were getting from seed stage to Series A, we were just in war room by default the entire 1.5 years

I personally tested the war room concept with @5511982667030 and then later @16468233438 when we were setting up the supply chain of cacao nibs from the rainforest to USA. Turn around time was in hours rather than in days. 

_PS: something to note, different teams end up implementing sprint differently depending on their group dynamics_ 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[2/22/24, 11:10:18 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, since this is a DAO, granting any individuals dedicated emails account from the TrueSight DAO domain has the undesirable effect of granting them privileged status making them more equal than others.

•⁠  ⁠admin@truesight.me
•⁠  ⁠⁠support@agroverse

More email addresses from TrueSight DAO managed domains that fulfill specific DAO needs can be made available in future but will be subjected to DAO voting decision prior to creation

This means that *_garyjob@truesight.me_* email address which I have been using till now will no longer exist moving forward. 
To ensure no emails are dropped, emails sent to this legacy address are being routed to garyjob@getdata.io. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

- larger sized chunks which means better quality due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to more care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

Jake (_DAO governor_) is right in the heart of two very large multi-level marketing networks.

[3/1/24, 5:31:54 AM] Gary Teh: *Proposed MLM model*

The following are perpetual income to be paid out for sales of Agroverse products to referrals by Agroverse affiliates and their network 

- Level 1 - 10%
- Level 2 - 5%
- Level 3 - 1%

*Layman terms:*
_everytime any of your friend buys @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs, you get 10% payout of the retail price_

_Everytime your friend’s friends buy @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs, you get 5%_

_Everytime your friend’s friends’ friends buy @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs, you get 1%_

_everytime anyone of the buyers returns to make a purchase you continue to get paid. This is a great source of passive income_ ‎<This message was edited>

[3/1/24, 7:12:11 AM] Gary Teh: Another alternative approach to listing our governance tokens for sales on the CEX to provide liquidity for our governance token holders would be to periodically declare *_dividends and pay them out in USDT*_ to wallet addresses registered on our ledger 

Governance token holders who want to acquire or offload governance tokens can just do it privately between themselves ‎<This message was edited>

[3/9/24, 6:00:24 PM] Anupa/diya: The last stage was an open discussion as group members discussed on various options for proceeding on the presentation I had made. If anyone still wants to take their idea forward. It's an open call.

As it has become a discussion channel now, anyone can join to discuss trading insights .

[3/9/24, 6:14:02 PM] Anupa/diya: Since the group has a new direction now, someone else could join and drive the research on trading insights.
[3/9/24, 6:20:09 PM] Gary Teh: They will need to go through the interview process first to be qualified before they are allowed to join
[3/10/24, 7:13:14 AM] Gary Teh: Once either the *_TikTok retail customer acquisition strategy_* or the *_chocolatier customer acquisition strategy*_ has been validated and proven to be viable, it makes sense to raise capital to scale them

Capital will be deployed for the purpose of accelerating the rate of market saturation within the USA market. Our estimates for the Total Addressable Market size (_TAM_) becomes important to provide visibility on how big the pie is going to be 

Capital will be raised via private sales of tokens to accredited investors using SAFT. That way, we do not get on the wrong side of SEC regulation

_PS: this is where a lot of founders who pitch me their project for fundraising purposes gets it wrong and totally mess up the pitch._

_*Investors do not invest money so that founders can pay their bills and live comfortably*_

_funds raised are for the purpose of either *building and testing a commercial prototype* or *accelerating the scaling of a business model* once it’s proven viable at a smaller scale._ ‎<This message was edited>

[3/16/24, 5:51:20 PM] Gary Teh: If this *_Go To Market Strategy_* works, we will continue scaling it until channel saturation before switching to target another marketing channel. Other _*Go To Market Strategy_* we have in our pipeline

- Cold calling Instagram Influencers
- ⁠Cold calling Chocolatiers listed on Yelp and Google Maps
- HIppie ⁠Festivals across USA
- ⁠B2B Trade shows across USA
- ⁠Smaller regional distributors in USA
- Larger distributors like ⁠WholeFoods, SafeWay and Sprouts

Seems the USA go to market experimentation pipeline is pretty much filled up all the way till next year.
