So far the consensus for the end of this current winter seem to range between end of this year and mid 2024.

For sure just like the naturally occurring wildfires of California, the overgrown undergrowth will be burned out. Nutrients will be released back into the soil to nourish the growing sequoia giants of the future 😁👍

[6/21/22, 9:08:53 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I have been getting feedback over the past week since the readjustments to our operations channel on WhatsApp that various folks who used to be on that channel don't really use Discord and Telegram. They were feeling disconnected as a result. 

Also taking into account the feedback I have been getting from folks actively contributing to our day to day operations that it is very hard to follow what is going on in the operations channel if there were too much messages not related to operations flooding that channel, this is the resultant new channel.

I would consider this channel similar to the one we have on Reddit. Community members can chat about any stuff they have on their mind that has nothing to do with our day to day operations / product roadmap or maybe occasionally contribute their thoughts on our DAO. This is so long as they are not hate inciting.

Also I am aware, different people from different cultural background have very different ways of bonding. To folks from some culture, a post might be considered trivial while in others it is considered inappropriate. 

I am sure as with the way channels are managed on Reddit, we will at some point have to bifurcate existing channels into new ones as our DAO grows and more members from different background / culture / country join so that context do not clash. 

Meanwhile we will continue to share progress with community members here as and when they become available.😁👍🏻

Social trust on safety is 0% or 100%

[6/23/22, 10:16:44 AM] Gary Teh: It is a matter of trade off between Fairness and Effectiveness. I observe in countries where population density is very high, they lean towards Effectiveness. Whereas in countries where population density is very low, they lean towards Fariness

The underlying consideration is how to minimize the overall cost incurred by the public system. 

A fair law would mean more people would be tempted to break the law since the personal cost is low however administrative cost for processing all the paper work will be high.

Genghis Khan during his reigned calibrated his system all the way to maximize effectiveness. A vessel state that did not pay tribute for a year will ensure its entire city destroy come winter when the Mongolian hordes can start riding again. This sends a very strong signal to other vessel states to not have any ideas about skipping tribute. It also ensures the Mongolian horde not need to be riding around the Asian Europe continent all the time to deal with these kinds of nonsense.

They sent three strapping guards armed with rubber gloves to attempt doing a thorough search of the car to find any stuff that might be at all illegal… 

They gave up really fast they open the doors and saw all the stuff I loaded inside… 

Strangely one of them was holding my mini fridge in his two pair of hands the whole time and was at one point even inspecting carefully all the “food” items inside…

[6/23/22, 4:42:54 PM] Susan Corea: Reputation Management system is what most governance frameworks of Daos lack, and why Doas are not functional nor efficient at critical decision making. Not all opinions matter; nor are all activities productive. Crowd wisdom can easily flip into herd mentality or circle jerks. And of course, it’s good to run social graphs or vectors of relationships between actors for bias, collusion etc

[6/23/22, 5:01:08 PM] Gary Teh: Very true. Even having DID is not enough. You need the ability to associated credibility to each person regardless of whether they are anonymous or not
[6/23/22, 5:08:41 PM] Gary Teh: With that said… the A**hole thing that we (more specifically I) kind of did with the regards to the system design is that your credibility established while playing our game will end up becoming associated with your “credit card” at some point in the game experience. So credibility is layered on top of KYC. 🤔

Feel free to push back if you hate this since you all technically have voting rights and a say in this 🤣
[6/23/22, 10:33:58 PM] Susan Corea: I think credibility or value system of actions/contributions on top of zero-knowledge proof is the only way Daos can work. Not hating it at all.

[6/23/22, 11:22:13 PM] Susan Corea: For instance: is there a way to weight (by identity layers/markers) 1. length of participation IE founders vs OGs vs later investors 2. Action or proof of participation (which you have) 3. Value weight (that contribution resulted in replicated or demonstrable actions ? In one Dao we used diff colored coded NFTs for classes of members, which carried different weights on voting. We also issued NFTs within specific timeframes after meetings for Proof of participation. We also upped the weighting score of those who consistently positied solutions which were voted in incrementally over 3 month periods (if the resulting value stood the test of time)

However taking into account the cost savings on AirBnB, the savings on the USD250/month long term parking and the wonderful experiences I had the past two weeks camping in the middle of nowhere and then somewhere, the USD360 was money well spent 😁

[6/26/22, 5:09:49 AM] Gary Teh: Wow!! I guess the world or Europe has lost their appetite for a prolonged war.
[6/26/22, 5:51:44 AM] Johnson Teh: It is not just that, most European have screwed up by making the biggest mistake of opening their fortress and “invite” the barbarians into their homeland, these ppl are what European ancestors have fought so hard to keep out, and they have zero commitment to upkeep the great value of Europe… 

Had been saying since 2014 that investors can forget about EU.
EU is at the beginning of their end.

This is also why some Russian are willing to support Putin, cos modern EU will be gone in next 20 yrs,
But Russia might not last this long 😂
[6/26/22, 5:59:44 AM] Gary Teh: Who are the barbarians you are referring to? 🤔
[6/26/22, 6:40:30 AM] Johnson Teh: Check their history 😜
Of cos many have changed and some will argued they now legally citizen of EU, but culturally they are not and will never be to defend EU. All they care is the continuity of their welfare, which is why LKY predicted the collapse of EU in 2000
[6/26/22, 7:49:54 AM] Johnson Teh: Russian’s invasion is the curve ball that might accelerate the decline of EU, as Europe is forced to cut off its cheap source of energy and consumption, EU no longer has its formal financial power and cultural unity to withstand a deep recession 

It’s naive and dangerous of the European youth to think that their sense of righteousness will stop their enemies 

But all these are good for crypto in the long run, we are seeing huge demand of fund inflow into sg. So we should step up the planning phase n get into a MVP phase for fund raising efforts

It is inline with what our DAO is building. On the surface it might seem a game however when you examine what is happening at the underlying blockchain layer, we are letting players establish themselves as subject matter experts of real world events. 

The reason this is important is because we need to fight fake news and prevent it from destabilizing our society! 😁👍

Based on this projection, each governance token will be worth 8.8USDT each by Nov 2024. To get there we need to raise USD150K by October through sale of our Governance Tokens.

- damage to world reserve currency status

Meanwhile we are in the process of electing 3 signatories from amongst our governors to control the wallet that will hold the USDT150K funds that will be raised to finance growth strategy and in-game operations.
[7/1/22, 4:05:10 PM] Johnson Teh: 👍 well done. 

On the aspect of “stake” other than USDT, what other options of crypto can “Predictor” use to stake?
[7/1/22, 5:14:13 PM] Gary Teh: The only currency supported is USDT. However players can opt to transfer in currencies we recognized with an exchange rate we established later on
[7/1/22, 6:19:18 PM] Gary Teh: @6598383264  What are the thoughts you have in mind?
[7/1/22, 6:40:26 PM] Johnson Teh: We should try to discover the new pain point of crypto mKt after all the revalue from the deleverage (aka I see current crypto winter as part of the liquidity crunch due to recent interest hike)..

So if we can provide room for ppl to find a “use case” for their junk coin, with a fees in USDT or even USD, but they only win their own junk coin, then we might have a new use case than just keeping these coin as medal of pain (sorry if the term “junk” hurts anyone in the community, but it is just a label for an item that was formally seems as asset but is not now)…

Of cos we will also limited which coin is deemed worthy to be listed.
[7/1/22, 6:43:37 PM] Johnson Teh: If we think along this line… 

Is much like using Apple share to invest on the px direction of Apple share px… 

then the issue is that. If more and more Apple share are “store” in our system to predict an increase in Apple share px, then maybe we might have an issue that the shortage of Apple Share available for sale will drive share px… but this will give a refreshing angle for ppl to use their half dead junk coin or simply well spreader out coin.

[7/2/22, 10:06:33 AM] Vishvajit: Happy Birthday Dude 🎉
[7/2/22, 10:10:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: Thank you all for the lovely wishes!
[7/2/22, 10:16:14 AM] Johnson Teh: I don’t know much about USA history 
But do know about human,
No one goes to war for value 
Everyone goes to war to gain value,

As long as there are sufficient resources to keep most alive, Most American doesn’t have the incentive to go a Cvil war w the National Guards (vs unrest to rob some Walmart).

Issue w USA politics is simply both side of the political spectrum need to secure a fraction to keep their job. 

This is the core shortcoming of democratic parliament, where professional politicians will do anything to keep their job, which then allow professional investor to exploit the gap. 

So let’s us not waste a crisis and invest wisely 😉
[7/2/22, 10:19:53 AM] Gary Teh: Ok!! 😁👍

[7/2/22, 10:22:21 AM] Val Lapidus: It doesn't take a majority to start a revolution. As a matter of fact, I think most revolutions are started by very minimal minorities
[7/2/22, 10:34:12 AM] Johnson Teh: Yap it only takes a spark to start a fire 

But the majority needs certain condition to receive that spark, the minorities is simply the tipping point. 

The key diff vs old age and now is that we now have an open communication, thus politicians have less ability to hide their true intent
[7/2/22, 10:48:57 AM] Gary Teh: As @12063955455 and @41799155602 mentioned just 3% is enough to start a revolution
[7/2/22, 10:50:09 AM] Gary Teh: So basically 10 million very unhappy people in the US. 

I should probably do a population tele while drifting across the US again
[7/2/22, 4:03:14 PM] Gary Teh: Everyone got very excited when they realized the TDG governance tokens they are holding right now, worth 1USDT right now, is going to be worth 10X in 24 months. 

I have been getting requests from various DAO members who want to find out how they can earn more valuable governance tokens. I have created a video which explains how to do so. Enjoy!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omiMtBxvg_M
[7/2/22, 6:46:43 PM] Johnson Teh: 10M Very unhappy army not ppl 😂 
Else will become 10M very unhappy live target. Of cos likely the other side of the camp will seize the moment and win it by election.

The  beauty and inefficiency of USA system is that no one side can be strong enuf to be a absolute in power to make majority suffer. 

Having said so the issue lies with USA taking in over the limit outsider to dilute its core culture, do see a push back from the locals to defend their core (life don’t cease to exist without a fight, so does culture which is part of life) so we will see more BLM type over time and these are the opportunity to buy in if the px is right
[7/2/22, 7:08:40 PM] Gary Teh: In US people and army not very different since anyone can buy arms
[7/2/22, 10:47:22 PM] Gary Teh: We have completed the required API end points to support our landing page displays.

[7/3/22, 3:44:17 PM] Gary Teh: Updates for today. Mainly housekeeping where I spent time plowing through historical conversations on our various community channels to extract insightful inputs from members to update to our ledger for governance tokens award 😁👍🏻

Singapore's ambitious cryptocurrency sector, by some measures Asia-Pacific's largest, faces an uncertain future after the recent collapse of crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, a high-profile casualty of the global digital currency downturn.

[7/22/22, 9:30:12 AM] Gary Teh: Totally makes sense bro. Actually is less fortune telling and more deciphering what your inclinations are. That way you can double down on what you are already inclined towards and stop wasting time with stuff you don’t enjoy anyways

[7/22/22, 9:45:38 AM] Gary Teh: Just got invited to give a key note at another conference in January, this time in front of folks in Europe interested to break into Tech scene. The sixth one if we count the two recent ones and the 3 upcoming ones end of this year.

 I think this January one will be a good opportunity to bring in more fresh contributors to help power our various DAO projects.
[7/22/22, 9:45:50 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, I just wrote an article on LinkedIn describing the new forking mechanism we introduced into our DAO why we need and how it works.

[7/22/22, 9:47:39 AM] Gary Teh: Our most recent hard fork is the TrueChain project, which is highly experimental with a 95% likelihood of failure. 
The good thing is even if it fails, the value of TDG coins which you all are already holding will not be impacted. 

This is the TrueChain's ledger which is forked off from TrueSight DAO's TDG ledger

[7/26/22, 5:29:01 PM] Johnson Teh: As a “truth seeker” and enteral realist of human nature, will like to highlight that such honor based system only works when supply exceed demand;

And when the participants of such system cherish a “long term” honor as it can bring them greater “value”. 

Try doing this in New York New York, esp In the Low social-economical status zone. Even the ledge will be taken 😂 

Also look at all mass movements and it’s activists leader, it all ended badly…. 

Check out AOC n her new suits 😜 (sure I find her cute, but doesn’t make any economic), and the “free checkout” line at LVMH riot instigated by the social justice as clamed by Trevor Noah. 

Truth is…. 
Human needs certain structure especially cos truth isn’t observed and respected by all at all the time.

Our issue is that the price of our effort to monitor should not exceed the prize of our effort to do so 😝

Enjoy your stay in upstate NY, 
it must be a lovely place to be!

[7/27/22, 10:12:16 PM] Gary Teh: I was brainstorming with Billy this evening on TrueChain our layer 1 Ethereum network which runs using the Proof of Authority consensus engine. 

Essentially, this chain serves the function of prediction notarization. 

One very hilarious idea that surfaced during our discussion was that once our smart contracts that supports various notarizations are implementated, we approached all the social studies research departments of the various universities around the world to spin up these custom Ethereum nodes to mine TrueChain. 

Thereafter maintain a list of all the public addresses of these nodes. Hence we know which university notarized which records. 

Then drive massive adoption of TrueCoin, the main currency of TrueChain, by running a massive referal program campaign amongst all the university students worldwide. 

Until that point, not a single dollar has been collected by anyone in exchange for any TrueCoin. 

Once people started very actively interacting with the network by making predictions using the DApps that were implemented on the network, approach all the exchanges to list TrueCoin. 

The ironic thing would be if the SEC decides to investigate whether the coin was illegal, they will end up hauling all the public universities to court… 🤔

The way TrueSight DAO backs the value of our governance tokens would be to 

1) keep a small enough stash of TrueCoins in our vault to back all the TDG tokens already issued out and then a little more just to further finance ongoing community efforts

2) maintain a list of public wallets addresses as authorized signers so that TrueSight DAO retains the authority to mine for TrueCoins
[7/27/22, 10:14:53 PM] Gary Teh: This variant surfaced after listening to @41799155602 idea of using MLM as well as being reminded by @17206665895 that an economic system can be calibrated to optimized for different values be it profit maximization (in a capitalist system) output maximization (in a socialist system), environmental impact minimization (in our new economy) or just simply social impact.
[7/27/22, 10:18:41 PM] Gary Teh: This variant would totally disrupt profit maximization model that we have crafted so far 

The interesting question to ask would be is it even necessary to setup legal entities at all?

There is no legal entity behind the Bitcoin chain… 🤔
[7/27/22, 10:20:58 PM] Gary Teh: Alrity. It’s 120am Heading to bed. 🙏
[7/27/22, 10:21:20 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: …Beautiful! You don’t have to set up legal entities unless you want to agree to the legal system. I would also invite us to consider not provoking the beast either regarding leveraging the Universities… just keep it off the radar for as long as possible. Only 11:20 here! Appreciatively
[7/27/22, 10:22:53 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: In other words don’t make us an easy target.. I did that with a Bitcoin hedge fund. I’d rather go the other way this time! 🌅🚀
[7/27/22, 10:24:25 PM] INZA: Hey Neil, pleasure to have you here 🤝

[7/27/22, 11:37:01 PM] Gary Teh: Just had to get this idea extension out to be able to fall asleep properly 

Absolutely controversial, but built upon one of the ideas surfaced by @41799155602 while I was in Dubai earlier this year 

Imagine having the rabbis, priests and pastors who leads “house of truth” from different religious denominations running those miners that handling the notarizations sent by DApps. 

An eco-system designed with such a structure would be well aligned with “Truth Seeking”. The coins they make could then be used to subsidize the community activities they run. 

Also, it almost becomes taboo if you knowingly send something “fake” for notarization by the miners at these “House of Truth”. 

I could sense some folks probably cringing when reading about this idea. If you do, please ignore it. No offense intended 🙏
[7/28/22, 12:03:42 AM] Gary Teh: Did some further research. Actually not very controversial 

This was the historical thing practice of Rome

https://abclegaldocs.com/blog-Colorado-Notary/notaries-and-the-church/
[7/28/22, 12:20:54 AM] Gary Teh: Once TrueChain is up, I foresee our DAO’s contribution ledger migrated over from our current google sheet over as well. 

So all DAO member contributions submitted for notarizations will be processed by one of those specialized Ethereum nodes in the “houses of truth”

[8/4/22, 9:13:26 PM] Geoffrey See: Hello Tess!
[8/4/22, 9:15:51 PM] Geoffrey See: Btw, we have been piloting a payment solution for companies paying in crypto/tokens (e.g. payroll) or receiving payments in crypto/tokens in a number of regions. Context was that we started helping with DAO with a legal wrapper creation and management but found users focusing alot on payment functionality on our platform. If this matches your need or if you ever thought about it, would love to hear from you to see what problems you face here and whether we can provide something of value. We are a Y-Combinator backed Startup (Poko) and we live to bring value to web3 users!
[8/4/22, 9:16:18 PM] Geoffrey See: Also doing this session with Bankless this Sunday
[8/4/22, 9:16:19 PM] Geoffrey See: Law/crypto/DAOs regulations and legal are the biggest headaches for many founders today. We are joining a few experts for a session on DAO legal wrappers (with a US/Asia flavor) to help everyone navigate an increasingly regulated environment this Sunday. Nathan Postillion aka LawPanda is one the most active legal experts in Bankless DAO. He joins me, Ahaan Raizada from Poko and Akshata Namjoshi from KARM Legal, a leading crypto law firm in India/MENA for a global perspective on DAO and crypto legal this Sunday.

[8/5/22, 5:20:34 PM] Gary Teh: Been reading this book these past few days that somehow got into my reading list. 

It is basically an in-depth study of existing successful “decentralized” organizations that are out. 

Contrary to the natural assumption that decentralization means the need for consensus in all decision making, the decision making model these successful organizations end up utilizing is an advise approach where an organization member championing a project should take inputs but not necessarily incorporate all these inputs into his decision making when driving a project forward. 

And anyone can choose to start and  champion a project
[8/5/22, 5:32:14 PM] Gary Teh: I am definitely seeing a lot of similarities between the process they have and how we have evolved till now most especially with the recent Forking mechanism that got introduced

Not sure If u rem I shared my limited view of USA “free speech issue” in 2015 in SFX…. 

The current political set up of USA might not be able to hold up to the onslaughts of unregulated internet media.

No govt (authority) can manage a nation (team) without a controlled mouth piece.   

Unregulated news media will be a source of society unrest.

[8/6/22, 10:12:36 AM] Edi Hsu: Mindfulness is a tool/technique used within meditation, and is often confused with “Mindfulness Meditation,” because of its widespread adoption primarily in the West.

The style of “Mindfulness Meditation” focuses solely on mindfulness, and does nothing to apply it elsewhere, other than to sharpen a version of concentration. 

As you may have learned at the Vipassana course, the style of meditation taught there uses mindfulness to develop ‘equanimity’ during the mediation. Or compassion. There can be other objectives during the mediation, so just labeling all mediation as ‘mindfulness’ is actually limiting and not completely correct

[8/9/22, 8:19:30 AM] Gary Teh: I observe some synchronicity going on at the moment 🤩

I was just having a chat with Junaid over breakfast yesterday at his office where he shared how his colleague sold off all his Google ESOP accumulated over the past few years and exchanged them for Lucid shares before it all went to zero

His colleague was following the advice of some Twitter influencer. 

Junaid raised a very good point by stating predictions are easy to access since they are all public. Compiling the credibility is where it becomes resource and time intensive. 

The current way a potential follower accesses how believable a Twitter influencer is is by checking if the most recent few predictions were correct and then quickly skip pass the due diligence process. It is a really half assed approach. This half assed approach was what caused his colleague to loss around USD500K of his life saving 😱

His suggestion is to charge followers who want to quickly access the credibility of a Twitter influencer
[8/9/22, 8:23:50 AM] Gary Teh: His suggestion solves the problem of shame player might potentially feel if the credibility is publicly available for all to see that @16468233438 raised

I think it also becomes interesting to bolt on a variant of the crowdsourcing model that @6590995199 surfaced a while ago. 

If a potential follower doesn’t want to pay to see the credibility score of a Twitter influencer, he can earn credits by manually entering the predictions he is seeing on published on Twitter accompanied by the link to the exact Twitter post
[8/9/22, 8:28:15 AM] Gary Teh: This is where your idea of a crowd sourced AI becomes interesting. 

All these manual submissions by potential followers are technically very well label data sets that could be fed into the GPT3 AI architecture that Gautam was suggesting 

This crowd sourced AI is trained using this crowd sourced data set to decipher from loose human language to the following parameters 

- stock symbol
- direction
- date
- target price 

We could technically charge other startups who want to utilize this model
[8/9/22, 8:31:14 AM] Gary Teh: I was wondering if Massive’s decentralized infrastructure could be used to for training AI model. 

If it does, it would be cool if we could convince Brian and Jason to give us some credits on that decentralized infrastructure in exchange for either utility coins or governance tokens in our DAO.
[8/9/22, 8:32:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: Isn’t this like my idea?
[8/9/22, 8:32:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: This is what I said what
[8/9/22, 8:35:12 AM] Gary Teh: Once this model is trained then we technically just feed the engine a Twitter profile and it can automatically monitor and detect if a new post is a valid prediction 

Manual Human intervention becomes less a requirement but still necessary for manual prediction injection until the human language changes.
[8/9/22, 8:40:30 AM] Gary Teh: I was reading through the technical specs of Twitter and Instagram for their NFT PFP integration 

I think an NFT system design  modelled similar to the US car license plate sticker might be viable. 

The sticker from the DMV only last for 12 months before it expires and the car is not legally allowed to drive on the road 

A Twitter influencer could technically mint an NFT on the Ethereum chain using the credibility he established on TrueChain to use as his PFP. The NFT will very visibly state its expiry date. 

This makes total sense since every trading strategy I have examined eventually fails after 6 to 12 months due to “regime change” and needs to be retired
[8/9/22, 8:41:54 AM] Gary Teh: True. The monetization portion wasn’t clear until Junaid surfaced that key component yesterday morning 😁👍
[8/9/22, 8:48:23 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding this newly described model, here are the behavior that have been validated 

- people are willing to pay for clarity and peace of mind when it comes to financial decisions
- people are willing to work instead of paying Fiat 


These are the parts not validated 

- Twitter influencers are willing to pay for NFT PFP that grants them legitimacy 
- GPT3 can accurately extract the key features given a large enough data set 

Benefits 
- we don’t need a casino license to run this model
- we don’t need a BVI legal entity to raise capital for marketing and market making since the whole model inherently relies networking and viral
[8/9/22, 8:49:29 AM] Gary Teh: Seems like a viable project for forking 

I guess at this point, it’s just waiting for a project leader to manifest in the DAO 🤷‍♂️🤣
[8/9/22, 8:54:56 AM] Kelvin Chew: I said the same thing bro
[8/9/22, 8:55:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: U weren’t paying attention
[8/9/22, 8:55:27 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s chat more about your pre and post oracles idea tomorrow 😁👍
[8/9/22, 9:02:23 AM] Gary Teh: True. Thanks for reminding bro. 😁👍

Lately, I have realized the structural impossibility of processing all the data with just one human brain. It is just technically unscalable

After consulting this book deeply, i have stepped away from this “artificial centralizing” function to just focus my attention on areas I am competent in and place my faith for the rest on other members who are competent in those areas and actively working on those scope  😁👍

[8/9/22, 9:52:14 AM] Gary Teh: It’s also been truly amazing to observe how the infinity open minds group that @48606646246 and @17206665895 are part of operates 🤩
[8/9/22, 10:59:57 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the talk on the future of work in DAOs for the Tech Career show that was supposed to happen in mid January got moved forward to mid November. 

I was just starting to wonder if it was going to clash with WEF that is happening in mid January. 

The universe sorted itself out 🤩
[8/9/22, 6:16:58 PM] Gary Teh: First came across the term “network state” when @6581076062 mentioned it to me last week. 

Saw it surfaced again today in the NYC web community 

Thought to just share the full boom here 

https://3lib.net/book/21941354/744e1c
[8/9/22, 6:18:55 PM] Gary Teh: Meanwhile @12063955455 recommended this book today 

Was chatting with Neil Bergert just now in Minnesota who mentioned he also downloaded this book recently 

https://3lib.net/book/16858169/7156c7
[8/9/22, 6:19:44 PM] Gary Teh: In case you are keen to check out the book I mention earlier this is it 

https://3lib.net/book/2646417/313cfa
[8/10/22, 9:22:54 AM] Gary Teh: I am observing a really fascinating synchronicity at the moment. 

The first sign was when @6594897484 proposed to write a book which would help drive awareness of TrueSight DAO's mission to fight fake news. 

Marta got introduced by  @48606646246 who was introduced by @17206665895. Marta is in the process of writing a book about various projects in the Web3 space and would love to write about our mission and experience we have acquired so far. 

Coincidentally, Deepesh reached out proposing that a book about Web3 be written and his company commission, finance and publish the book.

Just now jumping late into the Twitter Space that @48606646246, @17206665895 and Marta were holding, I quickly realize the they were discussing about co-authoring such a book.

Coincidentally that would be great material to use for the keynote at the Tech Career Show conference that Martina's team is organizing in November which happens on 24th-25th Nov, day 3 of World cup 2022. 

Not sure when our game project(s) will gets completed, the original idea was to have something out live on day 1 of World Cup 2022. 

However if all of these activities converged on that week, I would imagine the ensuing fireworks will be quite a sight to observer... 🤔
[8/10/22, 9:30:36 AM] Gary Teh: @6581076062 I had a chat with Van and Luke just now to walk through your payroll solution. Good stuff I am seeing. Gave some inputs too. I just occurred to me that you might want to speak to @4915759649730 as well. Based on my understanding of the tokenomics, he is in the process of setting up a service DAO that would find this solution of yours useful after some minor modifications 😁👍🏻

@41799155602 is right now in the process of working on the strategy for a Web3 project with the world marathon association 

I thought there might be some interesting synergy to be had. 😁👍
[8/10/22, 10:07:13 AM] Gary Teh: Reid Hoffman just shared a new video on networks which I found to be very insightful 

https://youtu.be/E3-etp5liXc
[8/10/22, 10:30:12 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 I understand that you and @6598622082 might be working on a research paper on DAOs. Marta published one last year for her thesis. I thought there might be some synergy there too. 😁👍🏻

@17755088150 has a background in physical space logistics and is keen to explore metaverse related themes 

I thought it would be great to get the three of you introduced 😁👍
[8/10/22, 1:36:37 PM] Luigi: Hi @17755088150 , feel free to add me on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-senese/ or DM for introduction 😃
[8/10/22, 1:37:21 PM] Luigi: Thanks for connecting us @14153000019 ..I hope is all going fantastic for you 🔥😄
[8/10/22, 1:39:32 PM] Gary Teh: All is great! 

I finally managed to avoid both the crowd and the heat wave up by one of the lakes in northern Minnesota area

I wonder what fish I am going to have for dinner later  🤣

Hello @971565972337  and @41799155602  very glad to be connected! 

I am happy to chat here/DM/ or find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahhoneycutt
[8/11/22, 11:18:48 AM] Aga - DAOist: Welcome to my world of synchronicities 🤗 I am happy to connect with you all! Fascinating things start now 🚀
[8/11/22, 11:24:08 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a lot of what I observe you to be doing is exactly what Reid Hoffman mentioned he was doing in the early days when he was figuring out what the concept of LinkedIn was 

https://youtu.be/E3-etp5liXc
[8/11/22, 12:43:07 PM] Aga - DAOist: Gosh, @17755088150 has mentioned to me today during our talk too! I will have a look now!

[8/12/22, 1:37:03 PM] Gary Teh: @17782305576 seems like India ended going the hydrogen electric vehicle way 

https://truesight.me/covered_entities/103505-hydrogen
[8/12/22, 1:52:45 PM] Gary Teh: Meanwhile, scientist discovered the Arctic is melting 4 times faster than expected. 

We should definitely figure out how to transition faster to hydrogen if that seems like the more viable alternative. otherwise I will be forced to pay @12022764665 a visit and start exploring the seasteading idea earlier than expected 

https://truesight.me/covered_entities/15407-arctic

Meanwhile seems like Ray Dalio already has a head start in that direction with the OceanX project. It definitely seem more scalable than building a colony on mars and transporting a whole bunch of people there 🤔
[8/12/22, 1:52:50 PM] Gary Teh: https://oceanx.org/
[8/12/22, 2:44:59 PM] Gary Teh: Jascha just shared this new utility called social mining 

https://www.daolabs.com/

I think it might just totally power the watch dog program that @6590995199 described
[8/12/22, 2:45:48 PM] Gary Teh: He is helping make the connection now to the folks from DAOlabs
[8/12/22, 2:49:06 PM] Gary Teh: Just had a chat with @12063955455 this morning who suggested to focus on providing a very small and simple useful utility that other projects can quickly incorporate into their tech stack 

I think the credibility as a service might be the lowest hanging fruit
[8/12/22, 4:03:11 PM] Fatima: Hi Tes, curious to know what you’re addressing in your article!
[8/12/22, 5:03:31 PM] Johnson Teh: https://earth300.com/
[8/12/22, 5:03:41 PM] Johnson Teh: This is a similar version of the E300 proj I was working on,  but this is richer yet less glam 😂
[8/12/22, 6:16:44 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished chatting with @6594897484 over the phone just now. 

I think the primary focus of the seasteading project will be food supply farming on international waters fish and seaweed

I believe the climate change problem is just going to escalate out of control over the next few years, forest fire,  flooding and drought. A lot of the places we grow food on is probably going to get impacted. A lot of the coastal areas we live on is also going to get impacted 

Since a lot more land is going to be underwater, might as well embrace living on water 

Coincidentally @6594897484 is already thinking of exploring East Timor region which is largely an exporter of seafood
[8/12/22, 6:51:28 PM] Johnson Teh: My refugee buddy’s family used to be their head of foreign policy 😂 that place is blooming but still in a mess,  enter bet is Vietnam 

Bible said it best,

[8/12/22, 8:32:04 PM] Gary Teh: Sentiment of BBBY is spiking like crazy right now on Reddit today

[8/12/22, 9:12:59 PM] Sarah H.: Have you heard about putting iron in the ocean for carbon sequestration?
[8/12/22, 9:34:07 PM] Gary Teh: That is the first time I came across this idea
[8/12/22, 9:34:57 PM] Gary Teh: You have any research materials on that??

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Laut
[8/13/22, 7:34:58 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, Hans Martin who operates Heierling Ski Shoes is in collaboration with a few other ski shoe suppliers. They are in the process of piecing together a blockchain based solution to enable circular economies for the manufacturing sector. 

It will start by first being focused on ski shoes manufacturing but later expanded to include other manufacturing sectors. It will incorporate DAOs and NFTs for raw materials tracing. 

he plans to launch it during the upcoming WEF. Seems to be promising. Looking forward to it. 😁👍
‎[8/13/22, 7:39:41 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/13/22, 8:11:44 AM] Gary Teh: One key topic that surfaced during my chat yesterday with @6594897484 was how “crazy” this minimal carbon footprint lifestyle configuration that i have been actively experimenting with looks when examined through the conventional lens of folks still subscribed to consumerism based identities. 

However being very close to the land over the past few years and seeing first hand what is happening in our environment, I conclude our current trajectory is going to be very disastrous in a relatively short time period. 

Broad based subscription to consumerism based identities has cornered everybody into a prisoner’s dilemma situation. 

Deciphering from my conversations with @17206665895, @48606646246, @17755088150 and others from the infinitely open minds group as well as the underlying themes in the various projects surfacing in our ecosystem unless this current value system gets displaced by a new one, we are technically screwed. Fortunately more and more people are awakening to this truth. 

In the words of Hans Martin who also actively runs the existential leadership group, “we are the few, but we will become the many. We know the storm is coming. Let’s get prepared and then after the storm we rebuild”

[8/14/22, 1:49:11 AM] Aga - DAOist: The more we talk about a new system, the more we imagine it, in more minds we seed it, we are getting there 🚀 

I am happy to explore it together!!! 😁 so many topics still to discuss 🤯
[8/14/22, 10:20:24 AM] Gary Teh: Yes!! 😁👍

By the way, almost done reading “The network state” 

There are definitely some interesting ideas to chat about during tomorrow’s session on LinkedIn. 

A few of the emerging trends I observed were surprisingly described in that book too

I think it’s a pretty comprehensive summary of the lay of the land at the moment
[8/14/22, 10:29:26 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the merge is causing a huge spike across the crypto space right now. It even showed up on our radar 

https://truesight.me/covered_entities/10116-ethereum
[8/14/22, 12:11:13 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Everyone will just have to grow their own kale 🥬 😂. Also Colorado is much wetter this year where I live at least.
[8/14/22, 12:11:29 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: @14153000019 are you familiar with information theory? Appreciatively
[8/14/22, 12:45:28 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. Studied that back in colleague 

Was applying that in one form or another when I was building out the sentiment analysis engine running under the hood of TrueSight.Me
[8/14/22, 12:45:37 PM] Gary Teh: How can I help 😁👍
[8/14/22, 1:16:46 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! Greener too perhaps?? 😁
[8/14/22, 1:19:43 PM] Gary Teh: Right now am thinking through how to apply information theory for encoding and decoding information in our smart contracts on TrueChain 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

I understand that you are right now exploring Solidity smart contracts too. Would be happy to jam together sometimes 😁👍
[8/14/22, 8:32:14 PM] Gary Teh: Came across this VR environment during a hangout organized by another friend yesterday. 
https://www.bannedbooks.art/gallery/buy-tickets

It uses this Metaverse platform
https://spatial.io/

I would say its very well designed. Once again I developed a splitting headache and was on the verge of throwing up within 2 minutes of immersing myself in that VR experience. 

I have tried VR environments multiple times in various forms over the past 3 decades and still ended up with the same effect. I am almost coming to the conclusion I genetically not capable of handling metaverse environments.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPTJpRdkGC0&t=28s

This is the rubric system we use to score DAO member contributions to our efforts to tackle the problem of fake news
https://truesight.me/rubric

This is the main ledger where all DAO member contributions are recorded
https://truesight.me/ledger

this is a write up on the forking mechanism which our DAO use to support new promising projects that we believe will help tackle the problem of Fake News

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thoughts-daos-getting-around-dunbar-number-constrain-truesight-me

This is an example of a hard fork we did recently

[8/15/22, 9:15:16 PM] Gary Teh: A very poignant example was the very first group of people that migrated from the old world to the Americas were literally all the troublesome misfits the European nobilities got tired of dealing with... 🤣
[8/15/22, 9:27:35 PM] Gary Teh: On second though the term “exiled” might be more appropriate 🤔
[8/16/22, 3:11:34 AM] Iris - Community Manager: That description suits Australia more, since the first colonies were built by the convicts deported from Britain. The colonial era of the Americas was more complex than that, the first migrants from the Old World were explorers, aristocrats, soldiers and farmers, mainly sponsored by the state or wealthy companies which wanted to explore the economic potential of the new lands. Add Christian pilgrims to the mix and convicts brought to deal with the heavy labour, and you'll get the picture of the early modern-day colonists of the Americas.
[8/16/22, 6:38:38 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Thanks for the correction. 😁👍

[8/23/22, 8:30:31 AM] Gary Teh: One key insight I gained after closely monitoring a bunch of these discord servers and telegram channels including the one ran by @41799155602 on their earn.games discord server is that bulk a high percentage of them exhibit a one leader (trading signal provider) and multiple followers (either real or fake) dynamic. 

Bulk of them attempt to monetize their communities either through subscription or trading commission. 

Those that don’t exhibit this dynamic tend to just end up with a disorganized laissez faire. 

Technically it seems like a zero sum game between different leaders (signal providers running their own groups)

Meanwhile forwarding these insights to project leaders hopefully it can help with their projects

[8/23/22, 10:20:47 AM] Gary Teh: Hanging out with @6594897484  now 
https://talk.brave.com/pHJ1GYo1RoAydI_BzvwZ1JzuPwOkpNfNcIAxiceaukM
[8/23/22, 10:21:04 AM] Gary Teh: Testing out this new tool that @48606646246 introduced recently
[8/23/22, 10:21:26 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to pop in. 😁👍🏻
[8/23/22, 12:54:57 PM] Gary Teh: One very interesting idea after chatting with @6594897484 was the idea of doing Monero cryptocurrency mining on international waters. Since its international, technically no government will have any jurisdiction.

After getting a tour of Round River Farm (https://www.round-river.com/) last week, engineering wise it seems possible with the recent availability of these three technologies

- Solar Energy
- StarLink
- RaspBerry Pi

Testing a prototype right now in my car just using a MacBook and Solar Energy. 

Once that works, will setup a spare RaspBerry PI I have sitting around.

If that works, might end up procuring the StarLink to test again.

If that works, might head over to the panhandle area to figure out how to design a floating raft that will support all these devises.

Bonus idea I have in mind is for the floating raft to be growing seaweed on its "Keels" which stabilizes it that could be harvested and sold off to some land based buyers.

[8/23/22, 1:29:13 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Make sure you learn how to use Monero first! It is more involved (requires more knowledge) than other cryptos I have found! Appreciatively
[8/23/22, 1:45:36 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! Great advice! 😁👍
[8/23/22, 2:17:40 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like the cost for StartLInk is a little on the expensive side for Maritime usage

https://api.starlink.com/public-files/maritime-coverage-map.pdf at USD5000/mth
For RV wise, it is still pretty affordable at USD135/mth.

[8/23/22, 2:29:41 PM] Gary Teh: The Brave Browser that @48606646246 introduced me to seems for sure very interesting. I have earned 0.071 so far. Would be very interesting to package it as the crawler for GetData.IO's infrastructure
[8/23/22, 2:52:51 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: yep
[8/23/22, 2:52:55 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: we are
[8/23/22, 2:54:01 PM] Gary Teh: One interesting thing I am starting to notice right now about the public infrastructure of MidWestern states as opposed to those of Tech hubs. Since there are less potential outlandish stuff happening tech wise, the administrators are generally less anal about locking down specific ports on their networks. 

Visited my second public library here after the first one closes. Same thing here as with the other one. Their network is totally wide open too.

Since the whole city only has a population level size of 6,575, the streets very stress free to navigate.
[8/23/22, 2:56:20 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah mung! Boomz!! 

I am wondering if it would be interesting to actually open source GetData.IO's crawlers and allow people to just run these crawlers on their machine and get paid a fraction of the Monero while using an L1 chain for queueing jobs to be crawled. 

That would suddenly make the infrastructure very interesting. Since once that is done, we technically get around the entire IP address issue
[8/23/22, 3:07:10 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Since Tornado 🌪 cash got added to the US sanctions list, Monero is a bold move right now. I’ve loved it for years but if the US were to add it to the sanctions list, you wouldn’t be able to get your coins out without risking everything.
[8/23/22, 3:07:56 PM] Gary Teh: You mean not being able to get it out via US off ramp?
[8/23/22, 3:08:10 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: You can’t even visit the tornado cash website from the US
[8/23/22, 3:08:14 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Rn
[8/23/22, 3:08:45 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Configuring the MacBook to utilize a Socks proxy is quite easy to do so
[8/23/22, 3:08:51 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: And it has secondary effects like less users which would be bad for the coins price
[8/23/22, 3:09:02 PM] Gary Teh: Got it.

within 5 years? 10?
[8/23/22, 3:19:06 PM] Gary Teh: Actually I am more thinking of a robot-maintained floating platform that runs a whole bunch of operations off shore in international waters. Much similar to the self sustaining farm prototype I was messing around with in one of my friend's backyard back in the Bay

Having the entire family off the grid would definitely be an interesting but challenging idea to explore. The solution will be very expensive solution though.
[8/23/22, 3:19:55 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: I’ll wave to you from an island 🏝
[8/23/22, 3:20:43 PM] Gary Teh: The more interesting question to ask would be how many percent of our coastal habitat area be under water by 2030. That would technically be a forcing function for this sea-steading trend you just mentioned.

[8/24/22, 10:25:09 AM] Gary Teh: Another phenomena I noticed is that amongst the GenZ demographic activism is very much alive. 

The two recurring themes I see over and again revolving around activism related activities within this demographic are "Economic Inclusiveness" and "Environmental Sustainability"

These two themes surfaced again just now during our Brave online session that @48606646246 ran to help Michael from communiivate.com iterate on their team's concept.
[8/24/22, 10:33:14 AM] Iris - Community Manager: I would also add climate-change activism, and actions against hate crimes

[8/24/22, 10:37:41 AM] Gary Teh: In the words of @12063955455, Web3 from a technology perspective can be summarized into two phrases. I login to a website using my Chrome Extension and my data is stored on a database that no one can mess around with. 🤣

@5511982667030 I wonder if your AI students might be keen to engage in some form or another with this
[8/24/22, 12:47:51 PM] Gary Teh: Had a great chat just now with @16506464893 about how we can bring actual food agriculture to Web3 using NFTs and Metaverse.

I will be reaching out to Ambarish (former VPE of Edmodo) who invested into an organic farming education institution based in India along his dad. And then circling back to David who runs Round River farm in northern Minnesota. 

When I did my research about farming back in 2017, I realized there exist this major problem of over-farming due to use of unsustainable farming techniques. If we could somehow solve this problem by upgrading our farms to utilize modern environmentally sustainable techniques, we could in one fell swoop part of the environmental sustainability and economic inclusivity problems I am seeing that is widely prevalent around us right now.

[8/25/22, 7:45:05 AM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 I was reading through some agriculture related materials this morning

Seems if we could figure out a way to boost up the level of carbon in the soil organically we might be able to once again recondition the soil for better yield. The side effect is that it will reduce the level of carbon in our air. That should help rebalance our level of carbon emission and carbon consumption, thereby reducing the severity of the heat waves and drought we are right now experiencing

One of the community members there immediately referenced zk-SNARKs

https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/

One of the folks there immediately pointed out how our universal credibility protocol was a right out of the box example of the credibility protocol that was mentioned “Network State”

Based on the ongoing chat it seems regardless of the variant that becomes widely adopted, there eventually needs to be a universal credibility protocol in place if Web3 is ever going to take off properly.

[8/26/22, 12:20:45 AM] Johnson Teh: Reckon the Key to seek a High Impact idea, is to validate it with a path of least resistance… 

Society is merely a collective of Individuals, and individuals cannot work against their DNA for long… 

Hence what is most desired in our DNA lies a pile of great questions that will generates high impact ideas 

But why just seek high and toughs,
When we can get many low and easy success too 😜
[8/26/22, 6:18:21 AM] Gary Teh: Because low hanging fruits have already been picked 🤣
[8/26/22, 6:30:04 AM] Gary Teh: I noticed this phenomena that Paul Graham described over and again even during one of the recent conversations that @48606646246 was helping lead the other day. 

The reflexive instinct is to shy away from figuring out those high impact ideas even when they are sitting right there in front of you. Mainly because they are hard to solve, even though they are already very well framed.

[8/26/22, 12:46:30 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! If the problem is there staring at us in the face all day long and everyone is complaining about it but no one has enough motivation to do something about it yet, then it is definitely the problem that needs to be solved
[8/26/22, 12:49:15 PM] Aga - DAOist: Funny, I was telling Marta today to start our map of thoughts from all these problems 😅 and I am sure that there are people solving them as we speak but maybe need some support like Michael...

[8/26/22, 8:27:08 PM] Gary Teh: @6598622082 saw that you inserted your first prediction today. Let me know which part of it doesn't work for you. Let's try to identify the rough parts of it that doesn't work 😁👍🏻
[8/26/22, 8:27:52 PM] Vincent Song: Ok. I had only a short time to run through it. Will play with it a bit more the next few days :)
[8/26/22, 8:28:04 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. 😁👍🏻

[8/26/22, 10:30:45 PM] Gary Teh: This process totally reminded me of all the different baits, lakes and hook sizes, float sizes, line poundages, time of day, water depth levels I had to experiment with before I started systematically landing the perches from the fresh water lakes here up north these past two month 

Interestingly, I had to go through the same process last year in May before I started systematically landing smelt fishes in San Francisco Bay Area 🤔

[8/26/22, 10:57:12 PM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 once you have finished chatting with you dad let’s the three of us set up a time to figure out how we can move quickly with this project 

Hans Martin just texted me today say he is making progress with Solomon ski shoes on rolling out environmental sustainability solutions on the manufacturing side 

I really want to avoid having to experience this pain in the neck heat wave every year… 😅🤣
[8/27/22, 4:33:28 AM] Marvin: ‎Marvin joined using this group's invite link
[8/27/22, 4:34:42 AM] Marvin: Hi I’m Marvin, thank you @14153000019 for the invitation
[8/27/22, 6:20:08 AM] Gary Teh: Glad you could join us @19293914948 😁👍
[8/27/22, 6:26:11 AM] Gary Teh: @19293914948 I understand that you are doing your thesis on real estate based NFT solutions and you are keen in finding more projects of that type as well as contributing to them 

I would like to introduce @16506464893 and @6598383264 

@16506464893’s project is to migrate acres of farmland in India to new sustainable farming techniques with the goal of both alleviating the suicide belt problem India farmers experience as well as battling our climate change problem by figuring out how to lock more carbon back into the ground. The plan is to tokenize the farmland and implement a Web3 version of BlueApron

@6598383264 is leading a project with the goal of tokenizing a hotel that is still under construction in LA. Basically implementing a web3 version of hotel REITs 

As mentioned both projects are still in their early stages 😁👍
[8/27/22, 6:31:45 AM] Marvin: Thank you for the introduction, yes, I am writing my bachelor’s thesis on blockchain solutions for joint real estate ownership, including fungible and non fungible solutions. I am doing a peer review and prototype implementation and would love to learn more about projects in that space and I’d also gladly share what I have learned and seen so far.
[8/27/22, 6:35:10 AM] Gary Teh: What are some recurring patterns you have observed so far during your research for both fungible and non-fungible solitons so far? We are curious to learn since both these projects are in their really early stages blockchain implementation wise
[8/27/22, 6:39:19 AM] Johnson Teh: @6581766589
Thanks for sharing, so Foodlens is it using blockchain to authenticate/record organic produces? This concept had been widely used in China, participated in one of such proj and that later received a buyout by a Chinese insurer. 

Overall my feel so that such GI concept works best for niche branded produces with high mkt value
[8/27/22, 6:41:12 AM] Marvin: It’s hard to generalize, because there are many solutions in between. From what I’ve seen so far is that non fungible solutions often aim to implement something like title ownership or renting out of entire spaces, they provide functionality to tenants. Fungible solutions, if they’re done well allow users to trade small fractions on a secondary market, they can forward income to token holders etc. So the use cases are often different. I.e. NFTs represent direct title ownership and Fungible Tokens frequently implement crowdfunding options
[8/27/22, 6:42:54 AM] Satheesh Paddolker: FoodLens can be used to track any kind of produce (crops, meat , aqua et al)
[8/27/22, 6:43:18 AM] Marvin: I have to add that in essentially all cases I have seen in the US, the properties were owned by shell companies. The titles were never directly owned by a smart contract
[8/27/22, 6:43:51 AM] Satheesh Paddolker: https://vimeo.com/645199448

[8/27/22, 7:34:40 PM] Gary Teh: One of the key principles when I was working with Brian and @15104587447 at Disconnect.me was that zero UX is the best possible UX since it technically ends up being idiot proof. We ended up scaling users from 50K to 1million within 1 year.

[8/27/22, 7:42:26 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 glad you could join us! 

I want to introduce you to a few DAO members whom I think there might be some synergy
[8/27/22, 7:43:25 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks Gary!
[8/27/22, 7:44:06 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 please meet @12063955455 

@12063955455 is the founder of Startup weekend which got sold to tech stars. He is right now exploring a web3 version of that. 

I think there is definitely a lot of synergy between your projects 

Do feel free to share your deck here too @14075792560
[8/27/22, 7:45:06 PM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 is at the early stage of tokenizing large swaths of farmland in India with the goal of building a web3 version of blueapron
[8/27/22, 7:45:34 PM] Gary Teh: @6581766589 is supporting @16506464893 project with his blockchain infrastructure FoodLens 😁👍

[8/27/22, 7:47:05 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, @16506464893 just recently sold off his healthcare startup 😁👍
[8/27/22, 7:47:19 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks just shared them. Do these contacts have names associated with their phone number?
[8/27/22, 7:47:53 PM] Gary Teh: Folks @14075792560 runs a venture studio that specifically invest in NFT projects
[8/27/22, 7:48:01 PM] Gary Teh: Yup

[8/27/22, 7:48:42 PM] Peter Peng: Thank you!
[8/27/22, 7:49:35 PM] Peter Peng: NFTs are the easiest way to do business and collaborate these days.
[8/27/22, 7:49:47 PM] Peter Peng: Especially globally
[8/27/22, 7:49:57 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 Vlatko runs earn games which is a launch pad. It is part of the DAOverse capital group 

Along with @971565972337  Luigi who heads the metaverse vertical for DAOverse capital investing 

I am aware they are looking for venture studios to collaborate with
[8/27/22, 7:50:22 PM] Gary Teh: @601112883373 Neo is the main lead of DAOverse Capital
[8/27/22, 7:51:05 PM] Gary Teh: I am also aware that @17755088150 Sarah is in the process of creating a metaverse project with the goal of raising consciousness through psychedelic
[8/27/22, 7:52:58 PM] Gary Teh: @48606646246 Aga, @17206665895  Neil, @919210068790 TUSHAR and @17755088150 Sarah are also part of infinitely open minds group. Their purpose is to promote love, peace and joy via various web3 initiatives
[8/27/22, 7:54:30 PM] Peter Peng: Thank you for the background and introductions!
[8/27/22, 7:55:30 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎Tres Garcia joined using this group's invite link
[8/27/22, 7:55:49 PM] Gary Teh: You are welcomed. @971585668399  Chris runs the Web3Galaxy conference which I think will be helpful for you in terms of generating deal flows too 😁👍
[8/27/22, 8:01:56 PM] Gary Teh: @6581076062 Geoffrey is the CEO of Poko.funds they are building an infrastructure that helps legalize DAOs, you might find it useful for the DAO portion of your venture studio once its scales up further. @14152693276  Tiffine is the partner at MS&AD ventures which invested in Poko.Funds seed round
[8/27/22, 8:02:58 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks Gary, I’m highly focused on NFTs and the Metaverse. It’s the quickest path to profitable revenue for blockchain companies. So if anyone in this group knows of any good Metaverse NFT projects with strong communities I’m open to including them in my dealflow.
[8/27/22, 8:03:29 PM] Gary Teh: If any of your project needs hardware for crypto mining please reach out to @381649929295 he is a specialist for that.
[8/27/22, 8:05:44 PM] Geoffrey See: Thanks for the shoutout. Also, been getting lots of inquiries on managing crypto/fiat payments on a single platform. If any of you have issues here, would be great to speak to you!
[8/27/22, 8:06:02 PM] Peter Peng: JETSON X just brought on an advisor in DC that creates legislation for blockchain, DeFi, NFTs and DAOs. Formerly was counsel for the Federal Reserve and Senate Banking Committee. Regulation will be our strong point as we move toward commercializing Web3.
[8/27/22, 8:07:05 PM] Gary Teh: I think you should definitely speak with @41799155602 I am aware they are in the process of launching an NFT series for their launchpad community

Also perhaps speak to @601112883373 , I am aware his team is in the process of launching the NFT series for the BXH exchange too
[8/27/22, 8:08:05 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩
[8/27/22, 8:10:53 PM] Peter Peng: I’ll start thinking on how we can all combine forces / consolidate powers and resources to potentially fast track JETSON X’s $25mm Fund I. Or maybe we raise a $100mm fund 😆
[8/27/22, 8:11:29 PM] Gary Teh: Happy to hear your proposal. 😁👍🏻
[8/27/22, 8:12:06 PM] Peter Peng: The goal will be to find good projects to invest in and make a solid return. For our LPs.

[8/27/22, 10:29:09 PM] Gary Teh: Based on the responses I gotten so far from Twitter community members who terry about $SPY that don’t have a lot of followers and not advertising some sort of news letter the primary motivation is not monetary but intrinsic and altruistic

[8/28/22, 5:27:24 AM] Peter Peng: I’m looking to use revenue from the NFT sales to launch the podcast. Please help if you can, it takes a village to build community.
[8/28/22, 5:28:38 AM] Peter Peng: https://opensea.io/collection/jetsonx
[8/28/22, 6:26:03 AM] Gary Teh: Yup quite true if they are really well coordinated. 

Much of the ones I saw were simple and obvious bots though, I literally had to scroll through 60% of all the bot generated tweets before I could find real humans to engage with on Twitter

I wonder why Twitter would continue to allow this junk in their stream? It doesn’t really add value only clutter 🤔
[8/28/22, 6:29:12 AM] Gary Teh: That is super cool! What is the theme of the podcast about?
[8/28/22, 6:29:54 AM] Peter Peng: The JETSON X podcast will be to talk about innovation, macroeconomic trends, really any topic that helps shape our future and see if we can get our voice and vision out there as we raise our fund.
[8/28/22, 6:31:13 AM] Peter Peng: Basically, help bring together people that want to help solve large global issues
[8/28/22, 6:31:41 AM] Peter Peng: While at the same time building cool technology to do it
[8/28/22, 6:38:32 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[8/28/22, 6:39:32 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, Infinitely open minds have a session this coming Monday where we discuss about various aspects of Economic Inclusiveness one of the major two concerns in our society right now. The goal of our discussion is to surface both problems and dive alittle into the solutioning side. 

This is the link to the event 
https://www.linkedin.com/events/infinitelyopenminds-7-economica6968330443997786112/

@48606646246 @17206665895 @919210068790 @17755088150 will be in discussion

@14075792560 would be great for you to share your thoughts there too

@16506464893 and @6596168016 I understand that both of you are active in the EdTech space especially @6596168016 who is an Obama Leader and is deeply concerned about the future of work and learning runs Doyobi, a very influential Edtech company based out of Singapore. Would be great to hear both your thoughts about how we can gear education to further foster economic inclusiveness for the next generation 😁👍
[8/28/22, 6:40:41 AM] Gary Teh: You are welcomed! Will definitely need your help once I figured out how to float the raft to mine cryptocurrencies in international waters 🤣

[8/28/22, 7:01:40 AM] Peter Peng: I love it
[8/28/22, 7:01:57 AM] Gary Teh: As suggested earlier, if you could further open up more ways for new members to contribute your DAO, apart from NFT purchases, I believe your DAO will further flourish 😁
[8/28/22, 7:04:33 AM] Peter Peng: JETSON X is looking to be a more exclusive DAO with mainly investors. Our thing is “if you can’t afford a $100 NFT” you probably aren’t a good fit for the DAO. The DAO will move as a unit to invest in to new NFT projects as well.
[8/28/22, 7:05:37 AM] Peter Peng: I’m expecting the price of the NFTS to rise over time
[8/28/22, 7:06:37 AM] Peter Peng: I’m doing this organically and not “buying my own NFTs” like many other projects… this will prevent a rug because the community is real.

[8/28/22, 9:53:56 AM] Gary Teh: Three things I could think of that caused this failure 

1) we are not embedded enough in the Twitter $SPY community. 

2) the behavior that is prevalent in the Twitter Web3 community is not the norm in the Twitter  $SPY community

3) time and week of day is wrong  

Immediate next step 

A) verify if 3) is the problem by trying it at 5pm EST Friday after all the traders are done with their kill and motivated to share about it 

B) build more relationships with Twitter $SPY community members and then directly  invite those with relations to the session 

Once these two are done if turn out is still low then 2) is the problem. We will abandon the idea of forcing humans to do things that are not natural to them. Perhaps try again in a few months when demographics behavior might have shifted
[8/28/22, 9:54:22 AM] Gary Teh: What other resources do you need apart from money?
[8/28/22, 9:56:10 AM] Peter Peng: Everything else we have, I think strategic partnerships (LOI) that will show future revenues will help.
[8/28/22, 9:57:15 AM] Gary Teh: Could you further elaborate on the types of strategic partnerships you are looking for? 

Naming a few concrete examples will help focus the DAO’s attention 😁👍
[8/28/22, 9:59:02 AM] Peter Peng: Companies that need a Web3 (Metaverse and NFT strategy developed that has a regulation advisory aspect to it)
[8/28/22, 9:59:18 AM] Peter Peng: Mainly large corporations
[8/28/22, 10:00:34 AM] Peter Peng: They won’t get into blockchain seriously unless there is infrastructure that has been created
[8/28/22, 10:06:42 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[8/28/22, 10:07:38 AM] Gary Teh: I see. You should definitely partner your with @6581076062 then. He has a relatively large pipeline of those companies he is working with 😁👍
[8/28/22, 10:08:29 AM] Gary Teh: What is the service you are planning to provide to these large corporations? That will help folks when they make the introduction
[8/28/22, 10:11:39 AM] Peter Peng: http://jetsonx.com/services.html
[8/28/22, 10:13:05 AM] Peter Peng: We only focus on food, hospitality and real estate
[8/28/22, 10:13:14 AM] Peter Peng: Industries
[8/28/22, 10:13:56 AM] Gary Teh: Good good, this makes your stuff focused 😁👍
[8/28/22, 10:14:21 AM] Peter Peng: Basically providing these industries an entry point into Web3
[8/28/22, 10:14:46 AM] Peter Peng: This is where the experience of our group lies
[8/28/22, 10:15:16 AM] Peter Peng: And where all the money is
[8/28/22, 10:15:37 AM] Peter Peng: Hotels, Banks and Restaurants
[8/28/22, 10:17:52 AM] Peter Peng: That all have a real estate component which is why our NFTs and crypto assets can become a private sector digital asset class when built on our regulated infrastructure

[8/28/22, 2:12:49 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: You just have to ask yourself what kind of experience it is that you want to have?
[8/28/22, 2:12:57 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: And follow the light in that direction

[8/28/22, 2:17:48 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: You got a whitepaper? Appreciatively

[8/28/22, 2:19:47 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: I used to have a crypto hedge fund and a wealth management  firm…. Not too big a fan of being “regulated” anymore
[8/28/22, 2:21:10 PM] Tres Garcia: ☝🏼 yup
[8/28/22, 2:21:31 PM] Peter Peng: I just brought on a new advisor. Former counsel for the Federal Reserve and senate banking committee. She helps write the laws on Capitol Hill we’ll be helping  create the regulation surrounding AI and Digital Assets
[8/28/22, 2:22:15 PM] Peter Peng: Because we are focused on real world utility and commercialization, they are turning to our group to help spearhead some of it
[8/28/22, 2:22:38 PM] Peter Peng: Regulation is necessary for economic stability and mass adoption.
[8/28/22, 2:23:59 PM] Peter Peng: What’s good about Web3, is that regulation should be a choice if the community
[8/28/22, 2:24:47 PM] Peter Peng: I think that the more a community adheres to regulation, the more users it will have within its network.
[8/28/22, 2:25:20 PM] Peter Peng: Bring some structure to the crypto markets
[8/28/22, 2:56:32 PM] Tres Garcia: Dear investors. You will probably lose everything…. You are welcome for the 🚀 opportunity
[8/28/22, 2:56:41 PM] Tres Garcia: Regulation solved
[8/28/22, 2:57:17 PM] Peter Peng: It depends on the community
[8/28/22, 2:57:49 PM] Peter Peng: I still think it’s fun to be in certain communities but I wouldn’t put the majority of my money there
[8/28/22, 2:59:57 PM] Tres Garcia: YOLO!!!!!

[8/28/22, 3:00:18 PM] Tres Garcia: 🚀To the moon!
[8/28/22, 3:01:23 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah having some regulation with make the entire industry explode
[8/28/22, 6:10:26 PM] Gary Teh: Depending on which aspects of web3 you are referring to, parts of it is somewhat headed that way already given that quite a few governments already acknowledge cryptocurrencies 

Regarding decentralized IDs I think it’s a pushback by the civilians in government regulations 

As for NFTs, the way I see it, in the future your driver license will be NFTs and they will be ran on managed by governments themselves. Just take a look at China with its Digital yuan and credit score system
[8/28/22, 6:32:45 PM] Gary Teh: I am definitely starting to notice a pattern here. Will monitor the Twitter $SPY community again for another week just to be sure. 

What I am noticing is the weekend crowd are mainly swing traders while the weekday crowd are mainly day traders.

2 counts - want to learn and improve by inviting feedback 
2 counts - want to provide value to community  
1 count - documenting as a reading journal
[8/28/22, 6:48:27 PM] Gary Teh: Getting to really know the Twitter $SPY better and better overtime with each interaction with them. 

It’s definitely been very insightful learning from @48606646246 and @17206665895 on how relationships are built online these past two months. In hindsight I have been totally doing it the wrong way before hence defaulting to doing everything offline via face to face interactions which worked really well for me. 

I remembered having this conversation with Rosemary while we were at the hostel in Iceland last year. She runs an e-commerce store and typically spends hours online per day to stay in touch with her community. I was at first puzzled why was that process so time consuming, now it totally make sense what she said. 

The root cause was I was seeing online relationships as something to be automated with machines instead of actually seeing the person on the other side as an actual person and having a genuine interaction. It is so inhuman and very Web2.0
[8/28/22, 6:49:04 PM] Johnson Teh: @19293914948 @14075792560 

Hi Marvin & Peter,

Thanks for sharing, v interesting insights.

I am not a tech person, 
Just like to review biz model from a simply human nature with an “investible len”.

Till date my limited observation on the application of Blockchain in real estate in asia, is limited to speculative play, so it is kinda tough to convince buyer to get involved. So it is more of marketing effort than real good dealing
[8/28/22, 6:51:08 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks for spending time in helping review and suggesting improvements for @14075792560’s project bro. I know you are really busy all the time bro, so this thoughtful feedback does mean a lot 😁
[8/28/22, 6:53:45 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of which the OffChain community that I happen to bump into while I was in New York is also really lively. Already I have received invitations from chapter leaders in SF to meetup once I get back 😁👍

Happy to share the links to join their group  if you are keen
[8/28/22, 7:19:53 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: @16033124339 is close with a VC. Brett, perhaps you can circulate this with them? 🔥🚀
[8/28/22, 7:22:54 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Yes you get back what you put in with people. It’s especially easy when you are not attached to a specific outcome. Once you add needing a community “to do” something the incentives…. Shift

[8/28/22, 10:24:30 PM] Marvin: Hi Johnson,

Thank you for reaching out. 

Sounds very interesting, I’d love to learn about what value propositions you offer and what your target groups are. 

At first glance, I thought it’s a great concept for everybody, but when competing with REITs, Crowdfunding, Private Money Lending, etc. I figured that it might only serve a niche: Smaller investors who want to actively engage in the selection of properties and are interested in a high level of diversification. In this US this can sometimes be problematic, I’ve seen that many tokens are only open to accredited investors (who must own a certain amount of wealth or exceed a certain yearly income threshold), this is already excluding the majority of what I would think composes the target group. Large investors can get great deals and achieve diversification without having to go through another middle man and small investors who don’t want to deal with the complications of real estate and market analysis might just buy shares of REITs. 

Trading tokens is also a difficult topic in the US, real estate is not as volatile and doesn’t allow for day trading, but you need to hold tokens at least 1 year in order to be exempt from high capital gains taxes. This would likely significantly take away from the liquidity advantages it offers over crowdfunding. 

In your experience, who is interested in buying these tokens and do you sell rather small fractions as Fungible Tokens or say an entire apartment/ room as an NFT?

Real Estate is extremely country specific, so things likely work very differently outside of the US. 

(Maybe something about my background: I’m German and still live and study in Germany, but I’m married to an American and will soon move there and can’t wait to go into real estate in the US. This is why I have been focusing on studying the ins and outs of American real estate as well as I can without hands on experience the past years, meaning some of the things I said were just assumptions from an outside perspective and should be taken with caution)
[8/29/22, 6:06:52 AM] Gary Teh: @48606646246 just wrote an article on community building, marketing and tools. I found it very insightful and well written thought to share it here as well. Enjoy! 😁👍

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/discord-aga-marecka
[8/29/22, 6:12:57 AM] Aga - DAOist: Thank you @14153000019 for sharing 🤗 I am so happy you find it insightful 🥰 

See you soon on our heartstorming 😍
[8/29/22, 6:15:34 AM] Gary Teh: You are welcomed! Yes! Looking forward to chatting afterwards 

One thing that resonates really strongly about the article is that when something is done that is out of sync and not aligned with the context of the community, it becomes painfully obvious. 

In that regard it make sense to first get familiar with various members of a community to avoid committing a faux pas. 🤣
[8/29/22, 6:21:57 AM] Aga - DAOist: True... and you can see that our group doesn't really like discord 😅 we need to figure out some other way to communicate and share ideas 😁 next step: google docs 🥳
[8/29/22, 6:30:55 AM] Sarah H.: I like using this chat for keeping up
[8/29/22, 6:32:33 AM] Peter Peng: Johnson, our first entry into real estate will be to leverage our JETSON X passes to allow members to access a Web3 coworking space we plan on opening up in NYC that assists with the needs of a hybrid workforce.
[8/29/22, 6:33:08 AM] Brett Palladino: would be happy to have the conversation
[8/29/22, 6:33:21 AM] Peter Peng: My first investor into Jetson was also the first investor in WeWork

[8/29/22, 6:39:51 AM] Peter Peng: Ah , how long does your event run?
[8/29/22, 6:43:10 AM] Aga - DAOist: Depends on our flow, recently it was about 1,5h...
[8/29/22, 7:21:48 AM] Gary Teh: @48606646246 and @17755088150 I tried using Discord before for TrueSight, members just ended up shying away from it 

As a regular member when I go visit other discord servers there like a million and one things going on. It’s just hard to even figure out where to start 🤣
[8/29/22, 7:28:27 AM] Gary Teh: In the end we kind of defaulted to having just one main chatroom. It’s generally ok to have overlapping context in the main chatroom. 

And for more important project specific operational matters a separate chatroom is created just focused on that so that members who are actively contributing to a specific project do not have to scroll through too much messages from non-operational context to get to actual operational ones.
[8/29/22, 7:32:47 AM] Gary Teh: In that regard, seeing the levels of engagement in a project specific chatroom also provides a clear indication if the project is still active or community members have also organically discarded the project and moved on to something else more interesting that is happening within the community 😁👍
[8/29/22, 7:35:54 AM] Gary Teh: So in essence, the community will persist beyond the lifecycle of any single project that might organically arise within its ecosystem.

[8/29/22, 7:47:21 AM] Sarah H.: Discord is overwhelming- there are only two communities that I can actually keep up with… otherwise it’s like a full time job.
[8/29/22, 7:50:03 AM] Gary Teh: Very true! 🤣
[8/29/22, 7:51:58 AM] Gary Teh: I think the nice thing about a single threaded chatroom is that you could kind of just jump in anytime and pickup from what is recent 

What I have noticed is there are usually ebbs and flows. And the themes discussed tends to naturally shift based on what is generally on the minds of the folks at that moment 😁
[8/29/22, 7:55:21 AM] Gary Teh: Ok. Heading into the weekly session now with @48606646246 @17755088150 @17206665895 @919210068790 
Feel free to join us there. Today we are discussing about economic inclusiveness. This theme is becoming very very important as AI and machines automate away most of our work and "human labor" (as cogs in the wheel) is in essence becoming more and more "redundant"...

[8/30/22, 7:39:01 AM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 I was looking through your deck and thinking your underlying model 

Trying to cobble an NFT collection onto your GP/LP fund as a way to by-pass the SEC restriction of only allowing funds from accredited investors into a VC fund is ingenious. However it is going to get you into legal trouble really fast. 

Since there is no clear utility yet for your NFT, all the funds generated from its purchased  will likely be construed as investments into your VC fund and the NFTs considered as equity 

I would suggest you give more thoughts to the design of the utility of your NFT as well as make more explicit how it value is being backed. That way, there is a good answer to get around the SEC compliance problem

Just my two cents worth
[8/30/22, 7:44:01 AM] Peter Peng: Hey Gary, we are only using the funds to further the development of the DAO. If relationships arise from the DAO that lead to someone becoming an LP it is okay. NFTs are simply a marketing tool. 

Again I’ve brought in an advisor and legal counsel from a firm in DC to help advise on the matter so we have clearance.
[8/30/22, 7:44:46 AM] Peter Peng: I’m also going to be working with the Federal Reserve on our JETSON Coin

[8/30/22, 8:35:24 AM] Gary Teh: Hmmm... It becomes more confusing then. I go buy this NFT so that the proceeds of its sales can be used to finance the marketing of the fund which I have not part in... 🤔
[8/30/22, 8:50:00 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[8/30/22, 8:50:30 AM] Peter Peng: The price of the NFTs rise as more people believe in what we are doing
[8/30/22, 8:50:39 AM] Peter Peng: And join the community
[8/30/22, 8:51:05 AM] Peter Peng: It’s about association
[8/30/22, 8:51:35 AM] Peter Peng: Again, it’s not for everyone
[8/30/22, 8:52:39 AM] Peter Peng: If you go to the Opensea listing you can see the utility
[8/30/22, 8:53:45 AM] Peter Peng: We’ll be coming out with more NFT drops for our products (JETSON Coin + Tablescape) and DAO members get early access to buy these NFTS at mint price
[8/30/22, 8:54:03 AM] Peter Peng: You are basically auto whitelisted
[8/30/22, 8:54:54 AM] Peter Peng: How would you have no part in it?
[8/30/22, 8:57:17 AM] Peter Peng: If you are skeptical, I would just wait and see. I can also stop giving updates about Jetson X within this chat if this is not something you agree with.
[8/30/22, 8:57:26 AM] Peter Peng: This is not my DAO
[8/30/22, 8:57:31 AM] Peter Peng: So I understand
[8/30/22, 11:51:07 AM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 Sorry for the late reply, I was chatting with @6594897484 and Francios to help them further refine the farming as a service idea.

Actually what might be interesting is if you turn your DAO into a service DAO that provides marketing service to your Fund. That will probably work both from a framing perspective as well as a legal perspective. 

So each year, your fund will transfer part of the annual management fees you charge your LPs to the vault controlled by your service DAO for marketing service rendered. If you plan to further sweeten the deal for service DAO members, you will cut a portion of your funds carry which you charge your LPs to the vault of your DAO as bonus. That way the value of your DAO's issued NFTs will be an actual economic model backing its value.

Marketing services I can think of are the following:
- sourcing of deal flows which your fund might invest in (sourcing fees)
- sourcing of partners to support your fund (introduction fees)

These are already the norms in the IB banking industry it should not be so hard for existing folks in industry to understand

These are just food for thoughts. I definitely see some promise in your idea, just surfacing some areas in your model which you can further improve. 😁👍🏻
[8/30/22, 11:53:13 AM] Gary Teh: From my understanding being involved in various DAOs, DAO do not by nature belong to anybody. It is just a group of like minded people who enjoy each other's company and thought processes. 😁👍🏻
[8/30/22, 11:53:23 AM] Peter Peng: So we won’t transfer LP funds to the DAO as we will hire for that position
[8/30/22, 11:54:52 AM] Peter Peng: The DAO should be community run and there will be governance proposals for use of the funds to invest in other Web3 projects. 5% of the royalty fees will go into the DAO treasury
[8/30/22, 11:56:01 AM] Peter Peng: The NFT holders will have the ability to purchase governance tokens that allow them to create proposals
[8/30/22, 11:57:44 AM] Peter Peng: The actual fund raised should no be commingled with DAO initiatives
[8/30/22, 11:59:49 AM] Peter Peng: We will use the funds raised to invest in technology infrastructure, Metaverse, Robotics and AI
[8/30/22, 12:01:42 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[8/30/22, 12:02:32 PM] Peter Peng: If a DAO member wants to become an LP, that’s okay
‎[8/30/22, 12:02:42 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/30/22, 12:02:44 PM] Peter Peng: But they must be accredited
[8/30/22, 12:03:45 PM] Sarah H.: Ooo how interesting !
[8/30/22, 12:04:38 PM] Gary Teh: I am still seeing the disconnect. So you are telling me there are going to be two pools of funds. One from the LP and one from the DAO members via NFT sale

LPs funds are invested in web3 projects directly for returns

What are funds raised from DAO members via NFT sale used for?
[8/30/22, 12:05:43 PM] Gary Teh: I also understand DAO members get to vote on how the funds being raised via NFT sale is used. 

The GP decides how the funds raised from LPs are used.
[8/30/22, 12:05:46 PM] Peter Peng: Marketing the DAO, creating of Digital Assets, and 5% of royalties go into the treasury
[8/30/22, 12:06:27 PM] Gary Teh: So technically the GP/LP fund has nothing to do with the fund being raised by the DAO via NFT sale then
[8/30/22, 12:06:43 PM] Peter Peng: NFT holder are now DAO members and will have a chance to purchase governance tokens to create proposals on how the funds are used
[8/30/22, 12:07:12 PM] Gary Teh: So NFT holders have control over how the funds being raised from the LPs are used.
[8/30/22, 12:07:15 PM] Peter Peng: It pays for us to create the ecosystem
[8/30/22, 12:07:23 PM] Peter Peng: No
[8/30/22, 12:08:03 PM] Peter Peng: It will control the funds in the treasury coming from 5% of the royalties
[8/30/22, 12:08:06 PM] Gary Teh: So you are referring to the funds raised via NFT sale and not those raised from the LP
[8/30/22, 12:08:33 PM] Gary Teh: 5% royalty charged on LP funds deployed to the project?
[8/30/22, 12:08:45 PM] Peter Peng: Funds raised via institutional investors are not controlled by the DAO, they are controlled by the management team
[8/30/22, 12:09:05 PM] Peter Peng: No, 5% royalty from NFT sales
[8/30/22, 12:09:57 PM] Peter Peng: There is 10% royalty… half goes to the creator 5% and 5% goes to the treasury
[8/30/22, 12:10:05 PM] Gary Teh: I see. So the LP/GP fund and how it is managed has nothing at all to do with the DAO nor the fund raised by the DAO via NFT sale
[8/30/22, 12:10:47 PM] Peter Peng: We are building Web3 infrastructure
[8/30/22, 12:11:09 PM] Gary Teh: We = LP/GP or
We = DAO?
[8/30/22, 12:11:17 PM] Peter Peng: The community will be able to purchase digital assets in our marketplace when it drops
[8/30/22, 12:11:31 PM] Peter Peng: We LP/GP
[8/30/22, 12:11:44 PM] Peter Peng: DAO = Customers/Community
[8/30/22, 12:11:45 PM] Gary Teh: Got it. Thanks for the clarification
[8/30/22, 12:12:04 PM] Peter Peng: Glad we are clear here
[8/30/22, 12:12:34 PM] Peter Peng: Digital assets purchased have an opportunity to appreciate based on the success of the company
[8/30/22, 12:12:38 PM] Gary Teh: I think that was the confusing part when I was reading through your deck.
[8/30/22, 12:12:46 PM] Peter Peng: No problem
[8/30/22, 12:13:07 PM] Peter Peng: Let’s pretend we are Taco Bell, and we create a DAO
[8/30/22, 12:13:17 PM] Gary Teh: Technically you have things going on at the same time which might not be even related to each other. 

1) your Venture Studio which is based on LP/GP 
2) your DAO
[8/30/22, 12:14:03 PM] Peter Peng: They are related by proxy but do not reflect the performance of the fund to the VC
[8/30/22, 12:14:33 PM] Peter Peng: The DAO supports the vision of the Company
[8/30/22, 12:14:56 PM] Peter Peng: If you no longer support, you can sell your NFT and leave the community
[8/30/22, 12:15:35 PM] Peter Peng: There may be some NFT holders that also purchase governance tokens that create proposals
[8/30/22, 12:16:22 PM] Peter Peng: JETSON X LLC fund will fund the development of the technologies used to run the DAO
[8/30/22, 12:16:33 PM] Peter Peng: We are building infrastructure
[8/30/22, 12:16:45 PM] Peter Peng: But we aren’t buying our own NFTs
[8/30/22, 12:16:53 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[8/30/22, 12:17:03 PM] Peter Peng: These are current best practices
[8/30/22, 12:17:29 PM] Peter Peng: Many NFT projects got rugged because the founders were buying their own NFTs

[8/30/22, 12:22:46 PM] Peter Peng: The DAO should promote the digital assets that are related to the Company Jetson X
[8/30/22, 12:24:02 PM] Peter Peng: The digital assets aim to have utility in the digital and physical Metaverse by providing ownership abilities to the community
[8/30/22, 12:24:42 PM] Peter Peng: These digital assets have the ability to appreciate and depreciate given market conditions
[8/30/22, 12:25:46 PM] Peter Peng: The digital asset value may grow exponentially more in value and faster than the actual company And fund JETSON X
[8/30/22, 12:26:44 PM] Peter Peng: They also may be more volatile.
[8/30/22, 12:28:25 PM] Gary Teh: Do the digital assets have nothing at all to do with actual real estate or are they actually backed by physical real estate?
[8/30/22, 12:28:29 PM] Peter Peng: JETSON X the company invests into more than Blockchain … its AI, Robitics, POS software to create the infrastructure
[8/30/22, 12:29:25 PM] Peter Peng: Virtual land sales in  Tablescape do not, but the real world utility is providing food delivery
[8/30/22, 12:29:32 PM] Peter Peng: And ordering
[8/30/22, 12:29:39 PM] ~ Lar: Hello everyone
[8/30/22, 12:29:42 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[8/30/22, 12:29:50 PM] Peter Peng: Hello
[8/30/22, 12:30:15 PM] Gary Teh: Hello Lar welcome to our chatroom! 😁

Mind introducing yourself?
[8/30/22, 12:30:37 PM] ~ Lar: I'm Larissa from Moscow
[8/30/22, 12:30:45 PM] Nelson ✨: I’m just silently learning here 👀 Don’t mind me 🥷
[8/30/22, 12:30:51 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! 😁👍
[8/30/22, 12:31:06 PM] Gary Teh: Happy for you to hang around too. We are all learning 😁👍

[8/30/22, 12:40:33 PM] Gary Teh: What does the DAO get in return for helping promote the digital assets related to JETSON X?
[8/30/22, 12:42:26 PM] Peter Peng: The price of the NFT digital assets will rise
[8/30/22, 12:42:43 PM] Peter Peng: If you are a holder you’ll naturally want to promote it
[8/30/22, 12:42:55 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[8/30/22, 12:43:13 PM] Peter Peng: You can then sell your digital asset at a higher / lower price
[8/30/22, 12:43:18 PM] Gary Teh: 5% of the royalties of their sale go to the DAO?
[8/30/22, 12:43:23 PM] Peter Peng: Yes
[8/30/22, 12:43:27 PM] Peter Peng: Now you get it
[8/30/22, 12:43:40 PM] Gary Teh: I see. So there are two different sets of NFTs then
[8/30/22, 12:44:20 PM] Peter Peng: There will be many NFT collections coming from our Web3 Venture Studio
[8/30/22, 12:45:00 PM] Peter Peng: And pass holders will get first chance to buy the Presales
[8/30/22, 12:45:06 PM] Gary Teh: I see. And the sale of those will all go to the DAOs vault 

But only this current set allows you control the use of funds in the DAOs vault
[8/30/22, 12:45:46 PM] Peter Peng: The initial sale goes to the creator ( as we may collaborate with famous artists or use our in house artists)
[8/30/22, 12:46:16 PM] Peter Peng: Those are creator fees
[8/30/22, 12:46:41 PM] Peter Peng: The royalties come from the secondary sales
[8/30/22, 12:47:12 PM] Peter Peng: 10% = 5% back to Creator and 5% to DAO
[8/30/22, 12:48:20 PM] Peter Peng: The DAO should essentially use the funds to invest in marketing efforts
[8/30/22, 12:48:52 PM] Peter Peng: But you all can create proposals to vote on given how many governance tokens you will own
[8/30/22, 12:52:44 PM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 @6594897484 and @6581766589 

I was checking out a discord server that @48606646246 briefly mentioned in yesterday’s chat about creating moneyless societies. There is a section that is devoted to permaculture where community members are very active 

https://discord.gg/QNmMWrPT

Thought you might be keen to check it out to explore what is in the mind of web3 community members who are  interested in agriculture related projects 

After yesterday’s discussion with @48606646246 @17206665895 @919210068790 and the rest of the folks in the infinitely open minds group, they will start focusing on sourcing for donation based projects that will enable folks who are keen to fully transition into Web3 by providing for the following on via “gifting” 

- food 
- shelter 
- clean air 
- clean water 
- community 
- spiritualism 
- purpose 

😁👍

[8/30/22, 3:03:42 PM] Peter Peng: The US dollar is strong because our military is strong
[8/30/22, 3:05:31 PM] Peter Peng: This is why you should believe in JETSON X
[8/30/22, 3:07:10 PM] Peter Peng: 🇺🇸 Americans are the biggest gangsters in the world
[8/30/22, 3:08:33 PM] Peter Peng: JETSON X, stands for Metaverse exploration… SpaceX of the Metaverse

[8/30/22, 3:17:58 PM] Peter Peng: If they keep escalating
[8/30/22, 3:18:57 PM] Peter Peng: Because in that case the US has nothing to lose and humanity has nothing to lose
[8/30/22, 3:19:42 PM] Peter Peng: Bur you didn’t hear it from JETSON X
[8/30/22, 3:53:01 PM] Peter Peng: The vibe is protect humanity and explore space and the Metaverse
[8/30/22, 4:17:00 PM] Gary Teh: @971565972337  @4917660989530 is looking for some help with metaverse related development. Thought the two of you should speak 😁👍

[8/30/22, 5:38:47 PM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 spent the afternoon chatting with @19209806391 here in Montana. I first met him in Kenya 4 years ago. 

He has been independently attempting to pursue similar concept as what you are doing as well in terms of self sustaining agriculture.

I spoken about collaborating. He is keen.  

He has a 1.5 acre land up in Wisconsin he is looking to convert before this winter. And has two more plots down in Kenya. Including the potential plot you have in India, we are looking at 10 acres right out the gates across three continents 

He is right now experimenting with flash freezing which seems to be a viable option for storage and transport. 

He belongs in the construction industry and has got a whole team of building construction specialists in his network ready to roll! 😁👍
[8/30/22, 5:40:37 PM] Gary Teh: @17206665895 I think you are right about telepathy and 5D. @19209806391 just had a hunch and texted me the day before when I was just an hour drive away from Montana. Even he independently brought up 5D just now when we chatted 

Would be great if you shared your boom here again. @19209806391 is looking forward to downloading a copy 😁👍
[8/30/22, 5:40:41 PM] Peter Peng: Apologies for the outburst earlier I’m just trying to align all the energies
[8/30/22, 5:40:55 PM] Gary Teh: All good bro! 😁👍
[8/30/22, 5:41:02 PM] Peter Peng: it’s a lot to handle
[8/30/22, 5:41:20 PM] Peter Peng: But I believe in myself
[8/30/22, 5:42:17 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to be the leader of the free world 🌎 is that too much to ask?
[8/30/22, 5:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: @19209806391 also mentioned things are probably going to shit this winter. 

He is the third person Today that mentioned this me. Francois who is based in Switzerland independently mentioned this this morning when I was having a chat with him

There is a lot of synchronicity happening right now
[8/30/22, 5:43:34 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just bringing the real energy
[8/30/22, 5:44:33 PM] Peter Peng: Energy management is my new job role
[8/30/22, 5:45:10 PM] Peter Peng: We are now cosmic
[8/30/22, 5:45:26 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through all the inputs I am seeing. What I am curious to find out is the agriculture yield results this coming fall in the northern hemisphere 

If weather conform to their usual pattern I think this winter is probably going to be very brutal. Given the heat wave we have been seeing in the northern hemisphere, the drought which might be impacting our autumn harvest 

And if the war in Europe last through this winter, I think mortality rate is probably going to be higher than usual in the northern hemisphere this coming winter

[8/31/22, 9:15:47 AM] Gary Teh: One thing I noticed that have been very unique about this DAO is that interesting ideas organically gets surfaced here, improved through critique and enhances through introduction of resources in one form or another. I almost think of this DAO as a decentralized board of advisors since members comprise of leaders and experts from various fields. The ecosystem is provides members the space to contribute in anyway they feel comfortable😁👍

I was chatting with @381642051030 last night who is the chief community officer for earn.games. Would love to hear her wonderful insights

[8/31/22, 5:54:32 PM] Gary Teh: Its a figment of imagination that folks thing are real. But when you look at it, it's a very well crafted fiction.
[8/31/22, 5:55:07 PM] Peter Peng: Money is an illusion
[8/31/22, 5:55:46 PM] Peter Peng: Buy please buy my NFTS
[8/31/22, 5:55:51 PM] Gary Teh: @19209806391 explained very clear to me how this fiction is being used right now to drive us back to the Feudal age where everybody ends up becoming a wage slave.
[8/31/22, 5:55:53 PM] Peter Peng: But

[8/31/22, 7:09:49 PM] Gary Teh: I think he probably dabbled alittle into that too
[8/31/22, 7:10:07 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, which stack are you building on?
[8/31/22, 7:41:45 PM] Gary Teh: Doesn’t not seem like a great idea to be heading into California right now.

[9/1/22, 6:16:02 AM] Gary Teh: Be wary of the foundation by which you choose to build you identity upon.
[9/1/22, 6:16:06 AM] Peter Peng: I like how you think, the best way to bring humanity together is to work together to destroy the unseen negative forces in the universe. We should start building cities on the moon and Mars. By first simulating this within the Metaverse and training the AI through simulation and then bringing the digital trust of the blockchain “DNA of AI” we can then build the brain for robotics.
[9/1/22, 6:16:54 AM] Peter Peng: And the fully autonomous infrastructure to bring heavy industry into space and space colonization.
[9/1/22, 6:20:05 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why AI and robotics should be doing the work. We just need to chain it up on the blockchain.
[9/1/22, 6:20:28 AM] Peter Peng: It’s more humane than this system of modern day slavery
[9/1/22, 6:20:56 AM] Peter Peng: We now have a technological platform to make this all happen if we focus.

[9/1/22, 8:04:50 AM] Peter Peng: With human influence, the spirit of humanity will never die
[9/1/22, 8:05:02 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why AI can never take over
[9/1/22, 8:05:44 AM] Peter Peng: AI is not OG like humans
[9/1/22, 8:06:36 AM] Peter Peng: The human mind is the best quantum computer
[9/1/22, 8:07:27 AM] Peter Peng: AI is just a tool…
[9/1/22, 8:07:34 AM] Peter Peng: Like the calculator

[9/1/22, 12:30:09 PM] Peter Peng: Zap all the energy as well
[9/1/22, 12:30:19 PM] Gary Teh: He came up with this whole concept after he got his ass whooped by Wong Jackman a huge portion of that fighting system borrowed heavily from DAO.
[9/1/22, 12:31:02 PM] Peter Peng: Their billions mean nothing without energy, it’s just a digit on spreadsheet

[9/1/22, 12:34:35 PM] Peter Peng: Physical and digital
[9/1/22, 12:35:23 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding this book. Seems there is a natural trajectory 

Phase 1 the artwork itself needs to inspire people to want to explore the worlds depicted within 

Phase 2 the stories that get told afterwards be it official or fan fiction needs to be compelling enough for people to lose sense of their reality 

Phase 3 introduction of the game where fans finally get to role play those archetypical roles depicted in the art. 

It’s going to be a long story process
[9/1/22, 12:35:59 PM] Peter Peng: The universal ledger system with its cryptographic hash system allows me to verify if a particular object is from the past or the future
[9/1/22, 12:36:12 PM] Peter Peng: Proof of History
[9/1/22, 12:36:19 PM] Peter Peng: Proof of existence

[9/1/22, 12:40:24 PM] Gary Teh: Do you have an actual tech documentation other than those marketing materials?

Hans Martin has started discussions with Solomon the ski company and will be bringing me in to help structure the solutioning for their industry’s circular economy DAO and associated NFTs

I am in the process of sorting through what is available and what not that is already out there in the web3 space. 

I am already aware of what @6581766589 @919158729122 and @15104587447 tech team can bring to the table on the solutioning side. 

Do send me your tech specs so that I can have a look to figure if it will make it into the solutioning package I am potentially stitching together 😁👍

[9/1/22, 1:50:16 PM] Gary Teh: I read this one many years ago. A lot of the tech companies that aim to attract and retain world class creative talents have to create and foster these environments. 

This culture really goes back to the silicon graphics and Hewlett-Packard era. That was literally their HR modus operandi 

What you see now in Google, Facebook and all the large techs prior to the current crash are literally replicas of the original  culture 

Web3 organizations (DAOs) will need to be able replicate these or something fundamentally different and better if they want to attract these talents away from those ecosystem to populate the current decentralized one. 

I observe this challenge of culture is what alot of European and Asian tech firms face if they want to compete in the same arena for talents 

The good thing is since we are now in a recession, the competition for talent will not be as stiff. However times of easy talent recruitment does not mean they will stick around once the times get better. 

Culture is still of utmost importance in keeping that performance edge. TSR which created dungeons and dragons was one such organization that screwed up their culture and ultimately got sold to wizards of the coast for cheap
[9/1/22, 1:52:24 PM] Peter Peng: Culture is very important
[9/1/22, 1:52:33 PM] Peter Peng: Steve Jobs
[9/1/22, 1:55:12 PM] Peter Peng: I’m combining the spirit of Silicon Valley, Political power of DC, and money power of NYC… to create JETSON X
[9/1/22, 1:55:24 PM] Peter Peng: Let’s see how it goes
[9/1/22, 1:55:40 PM] Peter Peng: Holy Trinity
[9/1/22, 1:56:41 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 could you send me your GitHub profile link? Need to get a sense of what you are able and not able to tackle on the engineering side when I think through the solutions bundling 

I have worked with @6581766589 @15104587447 and @919158729122 so I already have an idea the kind of code we will be expecting during their GitHub pull requests 😁👍
[9/1/22, 1:56:46 PM] Peter Peng: Im creating a quantum Illuminati
[9/1/22, 2:00:14 PM] Peter Peng: No we don’t store info on the cloud
[9/1/22, 2:00:29 PM] Peter Peng: Got lab
[9/1/22, 2:00:36 PM] Peter Peng: Gitlab
[9/1/22, 2:01:44 PM] Gary Teh: And you never had a personal public GitHub profile before?
[9/1/22, 2:02:39 PM] Peter Peng: No
[9/1/22, 2:03:07 PM] Peter Peng: This is all confidential

[9/1/22, 2:09:59 PM] Peter Peng: You are just an illusion

[9/1/22, 2:11:58 PM] Sarah H.: Lol thats too weird for me
[9/1/22, 2:12:04 PM] Peter Peng: Hahaha

[9/1/22, 2:14:36 PM] Peter Peng: Too much soul
[9/1/22, 2:14:49 PM] Sarah H.: Lol Im not looking for any of that noise
[9/1/22, 2:15:13 PM] Sarah H.: I am a conduit to for the universal love - not the romantic
[9/1/22, 2:15:16 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just messing
[9/1/22, 2:16:10 PM] Peter Peng: To be honest, I’m recently divorced from a Model and my new girlfriend is on OnlyFans and has 1million YouTube subscribers
[9/1/22, 2:16:38 PM] Peter Peng: She used to date Jake Paul
[9/1/22, 2:16:48 PM] Sarah H.: I am wrapped in universal love.
[9/1/22, 2:17:00 PM] Peter Peng: Same
[9/1/22, 2:17:08 PM] Peter Peng: I only have love to give

[9/1/22, 2:47:26 PM] Peter Peng: Gary, I’ve already hacked your quantum computer

[9/1/22, 2:47:55 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[9/1/22, 3:12:14 PM] Nelson ✨: What does a spiritual guide do? I’m curious :)
[9/1/22, 3:19:22 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 comedy to liven up the vibe as well as the mood of the channel is warmly welcomed. 

However please be respectful of other community members here who are keen to really further the purpose of our DAO which is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. And do restrain from any behavior that might be construed as any form of sexual harassment by other community members 

Also if community members are sincerely offering help. Please graciously accept their help with gratitude if feasible but still kindly thank them if the help is not applicable at the moment 

Two strikes dude (48 hours) 
Three strikes and you are out 😁👍
[9/1/22, 3:21:15 PM] Peter Peng: Okay, okay… I didn’t know the DAO had an HR policy
[9/1/22, 3:22:35 PM] Peter Peng: I apologize if anyone was offended
[9/1/22, 3:22:47 PM] Gary Teh: Thank you for your understanding 😁👍
[9/1/22, 3:23:25 PM] Peter Peng: I’ll keep it professional
[9/1/22, 3:23:33 PM] Gary Teh: 🙏😁
[9/1/22, 3:24:06 PM] Peter Peng: I mean, it’s a good start if we are institutionalizing Web3

[9/1/22, 3:46:02 PM] Gary Teh: I think fundamentally it’s a very tricky question mainly because the balance is largely determined by the kind of crowd in a community 

 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/

Who knows maybe if the demographic of the community shifts later, the line where the balance gets drawn will shift again 

I think that’s the fascinating part about community and culture
[9/1/22, 3:47:12 PM] Peter Peng: See, if you had governance tokens it would be easier to create and vote on proposals to the DAO
[9/1/22, 3:48:30 PM] Peter Peng: It’s currently a dictatorship in TrueSight
[9/1/22, 3:48:44 PM] Peter Peng: 😆 I’m just kidding
[9/1/22, 3:50:05 PM] Gary Teh: Glad you asked. We actually do

[9/1/22, 3:50:19 PM] Gary Teh: 😁👍
[9/1/22, 3:50:42 PM] Peter Peng: Gary, you need a smart contract
[9/1/22, 3:51:07 PM] Peter Peng: Otherwise you are just as untrustworthy as the bank
[9/1/22, 3:51:13 PM] Gary Teh: Good point. 😁👍
[9/1/22, 3:51:19 PM] Peter Peng: Or any Web2 company
[9/1/22, 3:52:00 PM] Gary Teh: The interesting question is how would smart contracts be used to enforce OffChain human behavior?
[9/1/22, 3:52:36 PM] Peter Peng: Through a Dapp
[9/1/22, 3:52:57 PM] Gary Teh: Go to drive to my next campsite. Chat again about this once I get back online 

This is an interesting topic we have been deliberating a lot over these few months
[9/1/22, 3:53:08 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s dive deeper into it 😁👍

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phantom-crypto-wallet/id1598432977

Apart from the humor, these are two clear values you brought to the DAO two days 

Chaos Monkey #1: helped DAO realized too much shilling is not desirable for community experience 

Chaos Monkey #2: to overtly sexual content is not desirable for community experience 

Do help yourself to the contribution submission via this link 

https://TrueSight.me/submit-contribution 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:12:54 PM] Peter Peng: Why do you need my wallet address?
[9/1/22, 6:13:12 PM] Gary Teh: Last time someone helped calibrated the boundary of the community was @6594897484 

I think the both of you will make great friends
[9/1/22, 6:13:28 PM] Peter Peng: You need to buy my NFTs
[9/1/22, 6:13:28 PM] Gary Teh: Airdrop you governance tokens for your contribution 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:13:40 PM] Peter Peng: Haha no
[9/1/22, 6:14:02 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. That works too. 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:14:40 PM] Gary Teh: When would that be? I am keen to join too 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:15:11 PM] Gary Teh: Everything is done and contributed to the DAO on a voluntary basis. Even non-claims 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:15:35 PM] Peter Peng: I have nothing to hide
[9/1/22, 6:15:38 PM] Peter Peng: Hahah
[9/1/22, 6:15:47 PM] Peter Peng: Or be ashamed of
[9/1/22, 6:16:08 PM] Peter Peng: So exorting me won’t work Gary
[9/1/22, 6:16:33 PM] Peter Peng: Your DAO doesn’t even have technology
[9/1/22, 6:16:53 PM] Peter Peng: Just a spreadsheet 😂
[9/1/22, 6:17:22 PM] Peter Peng: Plus I’m an openly a DeGen
[9/1/22, 6:17:34 PM] Peter Peng: So bad behavior is expected
[9/1/22, 6:18:11 PM] Peter Peng: I’m going to create the most DeGen institution lol 😂
[9/1/22, 6:30:00 PM] Peter Peng: Oh wait, you want to airdrop me tokens?
[9/1/22, 6:30:20 PM] Peter Peng: You have actually SOL tokens for the DAO?
[9/1/22, 6:31:11 PM] Peter Peng: Are they on an exchange?
[9/1/22, 6:34:53 PM] Peter Peng: Send me you ETH address and I’ll Airdrop you a JETSON X NFT
[9/1/22, 6:35:15 PM] Peter Peng: For letting me cause Chaos in you DAO
[9/1/22, 6:35:19 PM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[9/1/22, 6:40:43 PM] Gary Teh: Soon to be. We are in the process of creating the market listings on Solana, the liquidity pair for staking on and mining on Raydium. 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:41:17 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. Here you go!

[9/1/22, 6:44:53 PM] Peter Peng: I just dropped you an Ultra-Rare Gold one

[9/1/22, 6:46:29 PM] Gary Teh: Lol! Sure. Much obliged 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:47:12 PM] Gary Teh: Chaos is good. If you saw the Netflix Witcher series, chaos = magic 😁👍
[9/1/22, 6:47:15 PM] Peter Peng: LOL 😂 wtf is happening in the Offchain NYC DAO?
[9/1/22, 6:48:05 PM] Peter Peng: Speaking of chaos
[9/1/22, 6:48:36 PM] Gary Teh: Diarrhea ?? 🤣
[9/1/22, 6:48:44 PM] Gary Teh: Who knows? 🤷‍♂️
[9/1/22, 6:49:51 PM] Peter Peng: Hackers? Hahah
[9/1/22, 6:50:19 PM] Gary Teh: Interesting, I also do hang around reddit and talk shit day long there sometimes 

I guess it’s the organic make up of the demographics in this DAO. Hence I said each DAO/community has a very different characteristic 🤣
[9/1/22, 6:52:21 PM] Peter Peng: I just figure that if I’m just openly DeGen, people won’t expect much from me
[9/1/22, 6:52:43 PM] Peter Peng: Or hold me to a high standard where they can scrutinize me
[9/1/22, 6:53:19 PM] Peter Peng: But really at the end of the day I work on important things
[9/1/22, 6:53:23 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[9/1/22, 6:54:51 PM] Gary Teh: Interestingly, I also openly have zero expectations of myself too. Unfortunately, @5511982667030 , @6594897484 , @6598383264 , @6590667855 @16468233438 @6590995199 some how or rather all end up screaming at me at some point.. I guess I am a Degen in the closet 😭🤣
[9/1/22, 6:56:31 PM] Gary Teh: Omg!! OffChain nyc channel really descended in Lalaland with porn spam by bots… that is disturbing
[9/1/22, 6:56:41 PM] Peter Peng: Haha you probably hacked the Offchain NYC DAO 😂
[9/1/22, 6:57:19 PM] Peter Peng: It’s kinda entertaining lol
[9/1/22, 6:57:38 PM] Gary Teh: No dude, I was silently praying to myself my car don’t get stuck in the middle of nowhere with this shitty road I am driving to drive into for camping for the night 🤣
[9/1/22, 6:58:19 PM] Peter Peng: Lol, how many shrooms did you take?
[9/1/22, 6:59:20 PM] Gary Teh: Unfortunately I had no luck in that department so far this westward drift back to the bay

One of the worst experience I had was when I drove down a slope in the middle of the Arizona desert and realized very quickly my car couldn’t get back up. There was zero reception on this remote unpaved road and the closest town 30miles away 😱

[9/1/22, 7:06:28 PM] Gary Teh: Been doing that full time when I was in the US since the start of COViD 

It’s very liberating if you ever get the chance to try it. Plus it helped when I was driving around the country investigating into the fake news phenomena
[9/1/22, 7:06:50 PM] Gary Teh: A reporter actually wrote about my work last year 

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/
[9/1/22, 7:08:07 PM] Gary Teh: My dead worms 😭

They did not survive the heat wave in Montana and Idaho
[9/1/22, 7:12:36 PM] Peter Peng: That’s actually pretty cool
[9/1/22, 7:13:08 PM] Peter Peng: I was sleeping in a park in SF last year
[9/1/22, 7:13:25 PM] Gary Teh: During winter??
[9/1/22, 7:13:31 PM] Peter Peng: No summer
[9/1/22, 7:13:41 PM] Peter Peng: Only for a couple of days
[9/1/22, 7:13:51 PM] Peter Peng: It was fine
[9/1/22, 7:13:56 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
‎[9/1/22, 7:16:05 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/1/22, 7:17:31 PM] Peter Peng: Damn, I would love to be driving around America with one of those

[9/1/22, 7:18:06 PM] Peter Peng: Very cool
[9/1/22, 7:18:08 PM] Gary Teh: You will burn a lot of cash doing that. They are fuel guzzlers
[9/1/22, 7:18:29 PM] Peter Peng: I miss California but I get bored sometimes
[9/1/22, 7:19:09 PM] Peter Peng: Not enough action for me
‎[9/1/22, 7:19:27 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/1/22, 7:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: The activities are all outdoors and in private parties on the west coast
[9/1/22, 7:20:33 PM] Gary Teh: People doing random stuff all the time in their backyard, garage or some hacker space there
‎[9/1/22, 7:27:02 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/1/22, 7:33:00 PM] Gary Teh: @16506464893 thought you would find this project useful as a reference 

https://www.reseed.farm
[9/1/22, 7:46:50 PM] Sarah H.: I will let you know when we are ready for early supporters. I am available to you for any intention of manifestation work you’d like to do and have someone hold space for you and your will.
[9/1/22, 7:50:28 PM] Peter Peng: What does “hold space for you” means? Maybe I’m just missing something
[9/1/22, 8:07:37 PM] Gary Teh: Tyler from NYC OffChain is helping make an introduction to the founders of this project to help explore potential for collaboration 

@19209806391 this might interest you too since you are also working on setting up a self sustaining farm prototype right now 😁👍
[9/1/22, 8:18:55 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 do you have any further technical details into the two AI platforms? I know Vibhu is starting an DAO based around AI as well. I will be sitting with him and his team for a day of consulting on how to setup their DAO properly once I get back in the Bay. 

I think there might be some real room for collaboration here if your AI infrastructure is already there. 

He used to be the head of RnD for Google, helped setup Google India and if I did not remember wrongly wrote the initial codebase for Google translate. 

Pass me your stuff, let me look through it properly. When I sit down with his team on a full day session, I will help make the proper connection 😁👍🏻
[9/1/22, 8:21:47 PM] Gary Teh: The fast growing AI developer community that is maintaining alot of the AI libraries on GitHub that @14157417474 introduced a while back might need help with further advice as a well as a more prominent "door opener", I will be raising this one to Vibhu as well when I see him.
[9/1/22, 8:23:34 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, but I can’t share them
[9/1/22, 8:24:38 PM] Peter Peng: You would both need government clearance
[9/1/22, 8:25:34 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. What is the procedure to get government clearance. I am sure Vibhu at least should be able to easily get it. He knows one or two of the governors 😁👍🏻
[9/1/22, 8:25:59 PM] Gary Teh: Folks, the cofounder of Paper.XYZ just reached out stating they are recruiting for senior developers to join their team. So if you are keen this is their Job Description
https://znsrc.com/c/hamimiwxdv 

And this is the link to schedule an appointment to speak with their CTO
https://znsrc.com/c/mqopabrllh

Enjoy! 😁👍🏻
[9/1/22, 8:26:33 PM] Peter Peng: It all runs through the Department of Defense
[9/1/22, 8:27:16 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure if you can get clearance if you’ve been arrested
[9/1/22, 8:28:10 PM] Gary Teh: Oh well... 🤷‍♂️🤣
[9/1/22, 8:28:13 PM] Peter Peng: The Department of Homeland security reached out to me
[9/1/22, 8:36:39 PM] Sarah H.: You go through a through FBI background check. You give them 10 years of work and living history. Depending on the clearance they either send a form to former neighbors or go out and speak with them. Any arrest even if it has been sealed or expunged is available for them to see. An arrest does not immediately disqualify you, lying about it does. Drug use can be a disqualify you. Search federal security clearance and you’ll find a subreddit with all the info you need.
[9/1/22, 8:38:25 PM] Peter Peng: There are all types of people that work for the Pentagon, it depends on if they reach out to you or if you apply.
[9/1/22, 8:39:00 PM] Gary Teh: thanks @17755088150 let me go do some research on Reddit. Within my abilities, I really want to help @14075792560 and Vibhu on their Web3 projects to succeed! 😁👍🏻
[9/1/22, 8:39:02 PM] Peter Peng: If you apply, you may be screened. If they reach out to you to work for them it’s a different story.
[9/1/22, 8:39:28 PM] Gary Teh: That means they have been pre-screened.
[9/1/22, 8:39:52 PM] Peter Peng: They have already been watching me
[9/1/22, 8:41:44 PM] Peter Peng: They were impressed
[9/1/22, 9:12:27 PM] Tres Garcia: I think you are confusing clearance to sell carbon credits with security clearance. 

On the security front. To start 
1. You will need to be a US citizen. 2. Not a felon 3. Drug use is frowned upon. 4. Selling drugs is disqualification
[9/1/22, 9:13:32 PM] Gary Teh: Well, I guess I am totally disqualified by condition 1 for sure. 🤣
[9/1/22, 9:14:44 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks for helping clarify the security clearance conditions.
[9/1/22, 9:15:23 PM] Tres Garcia: 👍
[9/1/22, 9:15:36 PM] Gary Teh: Do you really need clearance to sell carbon credits as well?? That makes the whole carbon economy really tough
[9/1/22, 9:16:28 PM] Tres Garcia: I can’t groc how you can sell credits without a governing body / honest broker.
[9/1/22, 9:17:14 PM] Tres Garcia: Who is to stop anyone with ERC token from minting a few billion credits for China?
[9/1/22, 9:17:30 PM] Gary Teh: You are right about that! Good point.
[9/1/22, 9:17:32 PM] Tres Garcia: And whatever country… ect ect
[9/1/22, 9:18:25 PM] Tres Garcia: A regulatory body responsible for credits has to govern the program or there is no program…. So the real question becomes…. Why does it need a blockchain?
[9/1/22, 9:18:36 PM] Tres Garcia: Any database can do
[9/1/22, 9:19:00 PM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense too. So carbon credit on blockchain becomes a nice to have and not a must have
[9/1/22, 9:19:52 PM] Tres Garcia: Yup
Same with CV and education verification and a ton of other ideas we built in 2017 and went nowhere due to lack of interest.
[9/1/22, 9:21:02 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Yes. Unless it is the resource owners themselves which decided to adopt blockchain to do the roll out
[9/1/22, 9:21:31 PM] Gary Teh: In the case of Education verification if the Ministry of Education for various countries.
[9/1/22, 9:22:10 PM] Gary Teh: Actually the most critical part of any blockchain roll out is the initial adoption by the resource owners themselves.
[9/1/22, 9:22:22 PM] Tres Garcia: In the us there is a clearing house non profit that manages college degrees. Not a pain point for them
[9/1/22, 9:22:49 PM] Gary Teh: Zero pain point = Zero motivation for change
[9/1/22, 9:23:05 PM] Tres Garcia: Must be 10x
[9/1/22, 9:23:21 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! I was just thinking about this same number

[9/2/22, 1:25:01 PM] Gary Teh: Had a really insightful 2 hour long conversation with @381642051030 this morning about community management 🤩

Making some adjustments here after gathering insightful feedback from channel members 

We are reframing the purpose of this space a bit to more clearly define what it is for. 

Based on the feedback gathered so far, this is definitely a great space where members can find out more about various projects that are happening right now in the ecosystem, updates on  them, what these projects need help with next and how members can contribute. This is also a great space where members can share insights and the occasional humor 

The projects need not necessarily be related to the purpose, vision and mission of TrueSight DAO or even ledger. However their values must be aligned with TrueSight DAO’s values of autonomy, integrity and diversity 

For project leaders this is a great space to share your passion and find help from community members be it in the form of advice or muscle power. 😁👍

[9/2/22, 1:41:26 PM] Gary Teh: Also to avoid flooding everybody with too much granular details from various TrueSight DAO related projects we will be creating separate channels where members who are interested in more granular updates on specific projects can go to for more information. 

Hopefully this bifurcation will help us find a nice balance between having too little information and too much irrelevant information
[9/2/22, 2:01:07 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: sounds good
[9/2/22, 2:01:15 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: i just want the high level on my end

[9/2/22, 3:23:39 PM] Aga - DAOist: Btw I found this interesting video about climate change: https://youtu.be/xVwzxfon7LI
[9/2/22, 3:25:27 PM] Gary Teh: Definitely let’s do that! 😁👍

I am planning to meet @16506464893 too in Seattle
[9/2/22, 3:27:50 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks for sharing @48606646246. 🤩

Climate change can feel like remote fiction if you are just reading about it on the news 

It feels really real if you are baking in 35-38 degree Celsius heat everyday 🥵🤣

[9/3/22, 2:23:56 AM] Aga - DAOist: I will not argue with global warming, I miss snow for winter too 😅 but there are couple of reasons for it and honestly blaming us people for all crazy decisions, actions and manipulations is too much.

The best indicator is (for both news and private life): what emotion is this messege supposed to make me feel??? Not only what but also how they bring it, how many times repeat it, what action they expect from me/viewer etc.

And so when I see this shame, guilt, anger, fear as expected emotions... than it is clear the manipulators are using the lowest emotions and many of them (better chance to hit us one way or another) - they are rather in panic themselves because they know their end is close. Just a distruction for us. Let's keep our eyes and ears open. There is more behind the sceens. 

And there was some other video that I can't find where fireman were saying that the trees have been sprayed for years and the "new fires" tested (some sort of secret missions), that this kind of fire is not a natural way of spreading... 🤷‍♀️ I am bringing it up because destroying our natural forests is one of the key factors for the "climate change"...

P.S. Greetings from Europe where we have the same heat 😅
[9/3/22, 5:34:33 AM] Gary Teh: This definitely a very fresh perspective. When I researched into Fake News there are two categories disinformation and misinformation that compels the reader to act on something 

In this case what you have brought up is a scenario whereby the reader is caused to feel something very strongly however there is nothing really actionable. This leaves the reader in a dissatisfied limbo of feeling angst but no clear avenue of what to do next. 🤣
[9/3/22, 6:14:10 AM] Aga - DAOist: Also.. feelings, emotions, thoughts, then words even without an action are very powerful (according to quantum grammar the actual movement is in a verb "thinking" and not "running" etc.).. if you are not in the zero point or above you can't create your reality properly - another result of manipulation. Instead, you loop in their reality, become miserable.. they are "fed" by our low vibrations..

There is a reason why "love is the answer" or "love is the most powerful weapon". Love brings the highest frequencies they can't stand.. and I was a bit sceptical untill I started to feel unconditional love - seriously amazing 😍

Well, I can talk a lot about all of it 😅 let's just sum up to keep our vibes high into the positive and not let anyone take control over our consciousness or to divide us in any way..🙏 we have the greatest power 💪
[9/3/22, 6:28:28 AM] Sarah H.: My foundation of my project is love, it is the first pillar and the most important. 
When I do manifestation work with others we stand in a circle and the first thing I say is this is all created through love.
[9/3/22, 6:30:30 AM] Sarah H.: I am the conduit for universal love. And my project shall open the hearts of many. 

Also love what you are saying about creating our own reality. I am creating mine. I don’t watch news - or commercials and I walk away when people are talking about “news”
[9/3/22, 7:06:05 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/3/22, 7:06:31 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! This manipulation is a lack of integrity and detracts the reader’s autonomy.  

I think the interesting question to ask from this perspective is how would it be possible to know if a piece of information is written from the stance of unconditional love as opposed to a stance of manipulation?
[9/3/22, 7:13:41 AM] Sarah H.: I think it’s all about how it makes you feel. 
If you are repulsed by a piece, and you are vibrating in the frequency of love, the piece is not. 
If you are attracted to it, than it is. 
Similarly, your vibe attracts your tribe. If you’re unsure what frequency you are vibrating in - look around and see who is in your orbit. It will give you a clear message of what you are releasing into the world
[9/3/22, 7:38:52 AM] Aga - DAOist: I am thinking that maybe this is actually a good topic to start with and explore on Monday 🤔 we are bombarded by news and content while using your internal compas can fast select those that are valuable and those which manipulate. 

Another aspect is that some people do it consciously (not too many in fact) and some unconsciously through the conditioning and programing of this space. 

And if we want to give a good example, we should be aware and do it the right way ourselves, don't you think?
[9/3/22, 7:41:42 AM] Sarah H.: For me, it’s all about leading by example. I do not care what others do. I do what I know is right for me.
[9/3/22, 7:41:59 AM] Gary Teh: Makes sense too. 😁👍

Building upon what you mentioned, one thing I noticed, when I physically move from one ecosystem to the next, personally the vibes still feel great! Even though the belief systems of each ecosystem might be drastically different and sometimes opposed. 

The interesting observation is on rare occasions when two ecosystems happen to come into contact the combined vibes might unexpectedly spin from the positive into the negative.

When I take a step back to reflect how I always still feel good vibes regardless of the ecosystems I happen to be in at any point in time, it boils down to this one action of simply setting aside whatever mental model about the world or belief system it is based upon once I step out of an ecosystem. 🤔

In that regard, In terms of wavelength it can almost be considered as vibrating at every possible frequency while not having any frequency at the same time. 

Looking at it, it does seem quite quantum. 🤔
[9/3/22, 7:42:17 AM] Gary Teh: That is a great topic!! 🤩
[9/3/22, 7:43:52 AM] Gary Teh: Folks come to me sometimes and ask how a piece of content can be considered fake news or not. @17206665895 being the latest. 

Honestly, while I do know this phenomena exists, I still have no clear idea who would be effective solutions 😁👍
[9/3/22, 7:52:12 AM] Aga - DAOist: Great! Let's discuss it on Monday🤗 I know there are couple of more great souls who also have a deep understanding and experience of it like @919210068790 and Yolanda 😁 that can be fun 😍 and you can @14153000019 ask more questions that can be helpful to your mission in TrueSight DAO 🤗
[9/3/22, 7:53:46 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 😁👍
[9/3/22, 7:54:21 AM] Sarah H.: I was watching a video on sacred geometry- and it theorized that all things of the universe started as a point. An infinitesimally small point that was nothing and everything all at once.

Your feelings on being all frequency and none at all sound similar. And I think in a world where we are start dust it is absolutely possible and probable that we are everything and nothing all at once.
[9/3/22, 7:55:30 AM] Aga - DAOist: How would we name the topic guys then?
[9/3/22, 7:56:12 AM] Gary Teh: Actually in that regard, “bad vibes” are in a sense “good” too isn’t it?? Since it is all part of the same manifestation 🤔🤣
[9/3/22, 7:57:41 AM] Sarah H.: “Bad vibes” carry messages too
[9/3/22, 7:57:56 AM] Aga - DAOist: Actually I just had a great call with @919210068790 covering it too - trusting your inner compas even if information comes from someone who is considered as expert/guru/awaken etc..
‎[9/3/22, 8:01:18 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/3/22, 8:01:32 AM] Aga - DAOist: Well, "bad" or "good" vibes are just our human translation.. there are higher or lower frequencies and it is also a matter of their potency.. the low ones will not affect us if we have way higher.. it is quite complex 😅 I suggest you watch a bit of Marina Jacobi, she explains quantum very well 🤗
[9/3/22, 8:02:04 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Thanks for sharing
[9/3/22, 8:02:11 AM] TUSHAR SHARMA: 🙏🙏

Just did a quick check. Seems compared to the figures reported in the 3rd of August in the video, figures went down by another USD44 billion

https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma-holdings

Was having dinner with Ilya who works on Wall Street last month, he mentioned a lot of the folks are on the angsty side right now regarding their jobs. 

Yes, seem like we are in a technical recession.
[9/3/22, 4:26:14 PM] Aga - DAOist: Well, he mentioned also the 3rd world war coming in the end of the video.. I don't take it as part of my reality but I am sure more is happening behind than officially and we will see "surprises" coming 😅
‎[9/3/22, 4:32:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/3/22, 4:35:17 PM] Sarah H.: I like Ray Dalio - he does a good job of looking back at history. 

About 7-8 years ago I was applying to jobs at the SF Federal Reserve and readying up on their published research ( which I cannot find now) I came across a paper that clearly stated their goal (SF Fed) was to promote hyper inflation. 

None of this just happens - it’s all controlled
[9/3/22, 4:38:16 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! Awkward? Really hyper inflation?
[9/3/22, 4:40:27 PM] Aga - DAOist: They rather refer to China taking over Taiwan... Ukraine seems like a distruction too... being close enough (from Poland) I can say that there is too much of "odd" stuff going on... people normally go back to Ukraine and actually make great businesses now because of all this media buzzing...
[9/3/22, 4:55:03 PM] Sarah H.: Yes really… I was floored when I read it.
[9/3/22, 4:58:46 PM] Gary Teh: You mean people are now heading back into Ukraine? 

Interesting @381642051030 mentioned a lot of Russian companies migrated over to Belgrad to setup their offices. There is literally a thriving tech hub booming there right now
[9/3/22, 4:59:14 PM] Gary Teh: Do you mean the yearly 2% inflation target?
[9/3/22, 4:59:26 PM] Aga - DAOist: Interesting that I am watching now some series on Gaia called "the secret life of symbols" and episodes 8 and 9 are about US... covering dolar, banking and "US corporation"... really great programming, I have to admit..
[9/3/22, 5:08:46 PM] Aga - DAOist: Ohh, quite a lot to talk about.. and it is not just "now" and not this kind of "heading back". Ever since it started.. nothing is as it seems.. and to find a truth we would probably need to go there 🤷‍♀️

Mental Model 1 - The Top Down Approach: There is no need to understand their needs because I already know what my target audience wants. 

Mental Model 2 - The Bottoms Up Approach: I have no idea what my target audience might want, best not to make any assumptions and validate one behavior at a time hopefully we gain enough insights at the end of the day that could be used to build a viable model.
[9/3/22, 11:05:25 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this has been really fascinating, since the observation is done at two levels, firstly at the target audience level and secondly at the network level. 

As I have described to @6596168016 beginning of the year when I first shared the original tokenomics with him. We are technically playing a game within a game. Much like Dungeons and Dragons.
[9/3/22, 11:08:49 PM] Gary Teh: Contributors play the meta-game of helping build a game which the target audiences might eventually play.
[9/4/22, 5:18:16 AM] Tres Garcia: Did you miss the step on where you observe the user to identify and define the problem? 

I always ask “what do they do if we don’t exit? (Competitor, alternative, 1/2 replacement?) More often than we like to admit, the user of fine with nothing because it’s not a pain point. So demand has to be there.
[9/4/22, 5:19:30 AM] Tres Garcia: ICF can simplify or keep their double diamond…. Waaay too busy.
[9/4/22, 5:22:15 AM] Tres Garcia: You don’t always have to diverge to provide solutions. 99% of the time it’s right in front of your face. Just emphasize, define, ideate, prototype (build your system), test. Keep rinse & repeat till your kpi get better.

[9/4/22, 11:44:30 AM] Gary Teh: @6596798800 (who runs a quant funds based in Singapore) and @6598383264 (who runs a private equity fund also based out of Singapore) ever did mentioned that perhaps this opaqueness is not a bug but a desirable feature for these folks who are offering such trading strategies as a service. 

And yes you are right, regarding that project, once we have dived deep enough into the demographic we might end up having to accept with humility that they might not need a solution after all and are happy with the status quo. 

However what I observed when chatting with @15104587447, was that he recently became involved as an investor in a project based out of New York that allows certified financial planners to get around that problem but with a slightly different approach.
[9/4/22, 11:47:19 AM] Gary Teh: When I was speaking to Catherine and Ray beginning of the year while I was in Singapore. I quickly realized this problem of credibility is more prevalent than realized. 

Catherine surfaced how "fake information" was disseminated in the real estate industry to "nudge" investors in commercial properties into a decision

Ray surfaced how "fake information" was disseminated in the healthcare research space just so as to boost sales figures.

[9/4/22, 11:51:15 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/4/22, 11:51:42 AM] Gary Teh: In a nutshell, the way I am seeing it. Perhaps it is a "desirable" feature on the Sell side, but is it really such a "desirable" feature in our overall society? 

If it is not, Is it not possible to turn this whole thing around. Instead of relying on the time consuming process of building trust, we default to a "trustless" facility, similar to the "US consumer credit score" system.
[9/4/22, 11:52:54 AM] Gary Teh: I recently became aware that China already has such a credit score system in place. Coincidentally such a system was also described in the book the Network state which I recently read.
[9/4/22, 12:00:02 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I received your private message expressing interest in getting involved in the projects in this space. Will follow up privately with you there and make the necessary introductions to the project leaders thereafter. 😁👍🏻
[9/4/22, 9:00:09 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/4/22, 9:01:00 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, @48606646246 will be hosting this event tomorrow where we discuss about finding your inner compass in our Post-Truth world

https://www.linkedin.com/events/infinitelyopenminds-8-findingyo6971862501382598656/

Do feel free to join our discussion where we explore deeper into various facets of Information pollution and what it means for us 

@17206665895 @919210068790 @17755088150 will be there too 😁👍
[9/4/22, 9:06:12 PM] Jonathan: ‎Jonathan joined using this group's invite link
[9/4/22, 9:17:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/4/22, 9:17:49 PM] Gary Teh: Glad you could join us @8618926086648! It was a pleasure chatting with you just now. 

Folks please be introduced to Jonathan. He is the founder of OffChain Global. I happened to stumble upon their chapter in New York when I was there visiting @15104587447 (Billy) in New Jersey in June.

OffChain Global started in 2017 and has rapidly grown since then, they have established chapters in 150 cities around the world. Their purpose is to help bring more professionals to Web3. One of their vision is to established a decentralized LinkedIn

Right now we are coordinating their efforts with Infinitely Open Minds, Web3United, Communiivate and Radius.Space to realize this vision.

OffChain Global - has a very wide and established of professionals looking to transit over to Web3
Infinitely Open Minds Group - is deciphering how the new world should look like once we transition into Web3
Web3United - identify projects locally that professionals can participate to transition fully into web3
Communiivate - platform for web3 community communications
Radius.space - platform that list all these jobs of relevant web3 projects
TrueChain (A TrueSight DAO project) - a source of credibility that allows professionals to easily move from one project to the next
[9/4/22, 10:15:34 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : ‎You added Ken Nim - Bay Area 
[9/4/22, 10:14:52 PM] Jonathan: Thank you Gary. Hello everyone! Let’s invite Ken in here as well?
[9/4/22, 10:15:22 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Let's do that! 😁👍🏻
[9/4/22, 10:16:40 PM] Gary Teh: Hi @14152032783(Ken), at @8618926086648's welcome to TrueSight DAO's network. 😁👍🏻
[9/4/22, 10:18:16 PM] Gary Teh: @8618926086648 and @14152032783 I understand that OffChain global has a chapter that is focused on environmental sustainability as well.

@16506464893, @6594897484 and @19209806391 are focused on projects addressing self sustainability on farms and seafood. Would be great if they could be introduced to members of that chapter. 😁👍🏻
[9/4/22, 10:19:18 PM] Sarah H.: Welcome @8618926086648 and @15104587447  !
[9/4/22, 10:20:26 PM] Jonathan: Yes it is more of a group for discussion but will have events later. I will send you the link - just started
[9/4/22, 10:21:39 PM] Gary Teh: Cool! Got the link. Sharing it here too 😁👍🏻
https://t.me/+UOuOexsYgFhiZTU1
[9/4/22, 10:43:35 PM] Gary Teh: @8618926086648 is there a chapter in Seattle? @16506464893 is based there. 😁
[9/4/22, 11:10:54 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks for connecting us Gary. There’s currently no chapter in seattle, but we would like to start one there.

This is Ken from San Francisco.

Here’s my LinkedIn for further connection.
[9/5/22, 6:33:03 AM] Gary Teh: UK just announced its new prime minister. It’s third female prime minister in its history. 

Do you think it’s a great time to start accumulating the British pound $GBP or a great time to start shorting it? 

https://twitter.com/truesightdao/status/1566780467789320193
[9/5/22, 6:34:30 AM] Kelvin Chew: As long as they sanction oil from Russia. They are committing suicide
[9/5/22, 6:35:06 AM] Gary Teh: So short? 😁
[9/5/22, 6:35:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s past the time for shorting. U should have done so ages ago in Jan
[9/5/22, 6:36:19 AM] Kelvin Chew: But as long as usa yields > British yields. + British econo risks > usa risks

Pounds will go down
[9/5/22, 6:36:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: Same as euro and japan
[9/5/22, 6:37:57 AM] Gary Teh: Thanks for sharing. 😁👍

Thoughts from any other folks?
[9/5/22, 6:40:31 AM] Marta: ‎Marta joined using this group's invite link
[9/5/22, 6:42:58 AM] Marta: Hello everyone, my name is Marta and I am a content writer and community manager, currently I work for MYTOKYBiRD and UFOstart, both are web3 startups. I met Gary through Infinitely Open Minds live talks and we really get along well and I think True Sight DAO does really cool stuff, so here I am 😁
[9/5/22, 6:45:03 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Thanks for joining us @48691650760 😁👍

Could you share more about the mission vision and purpose of both projects so that members could find out more about it? 😁👍

We are looking forward to supporting more projects that are aligned with our values
[9/5/22, 6:46:04 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, @48606646246 @919210068790 @17206665895 and @17755088150 are here too 😁👍
[9/5/22, 6:52:06 AM] Marta: Yes, sure! So, in short, MYTOKYBiRD is going to be a social media platform that is going to enable transparent ngo donations while at the same time providing space for good quality content and discussions about good causes. UFOstart is a project that wants to build an automated marketing strategy tool that helps find the most optimal marketing solution, reducing the human bias that is usually a misleading factor while receiving marketing consulting.
[9/5/22, 6:52:49 AM] Marta: Let me drop links to the websites as well in case anyone is curious :) MYTOKYBiRD has only a simple company website, the platform is going live by the end of the next year
[9/5/22, 6:53:00 AM] Marta: https://mytokybird.xyz/
[9/5/22, 6:53:08 AM] Marta: https://www.ufostart.com/
[9/5/22, 6:53:20 AM] Marta: Happy to be here!
[9/5/22, 7:49:31 AM] Gary Teh: What are things you immediately need help with for both projects? 😁👍
[9/5/22, 7:54:37 AM] Gary Teh: I believe there might be some synergy to be had between this project and TrueSight DAO’s global sentiment analysis engine 

Our engine pulls all the most popular headlines from 400 of the top news portals around the world and turn them into a feed of the mist discussed topics 

This is an API of how that might be consumed 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/documentation

Happy to chat more about integrations 😁👍
[9/5/22, 8:00:06 AM] Marta: That's a very good question, we already discussed mytokybird so I think here the things will be naturally moving forward. For ufostart, I will make an intro of true sight dao during our coworking session on Friday and I will get back with you with sth constructive 😁
[9/5/22, 8:00:32 AM] Marta: But there is synergy, indeed
[9/5/22, 8:03:03 AM] Marta: I just read the description, so I will also write about mytokybird soon so that everything is well explained!
[9/5/22, 8:04:03 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful looking forward!
[9/5/22, 11:10:34 AM] Gary Teh: @19209806391  and @16506464893 Brian shared this just now at the infinitely open minds chat on a working off the grid prototype that a bunch of Canadians have setup up north! 

 A lovely and relatively short (12 mins) video on off-grid passive solar geodesic domes that can be used as 4-season year-round greenhouses in just about any climate and growing zone. 🤩

[9/5/22, 2:21:31 PM] Gary Teh: It was a wonderful lunch!! great catching up! 

By the way, @41799155602 and @6598383264 are familiar with legal compliance for the cross border shipping of produce

I am also aware @6598383264 is familiar with the buy side on the China side 

Let’s setup a time to chat with @6581766589to walk through what is already there on foodlens to figure out if we have what is already needed for our agriculture prototype 

Once @19209806391gets more settled in Wisconsin we could setup a time to figure out the buy side for the agriculture produce in the US 
Speaking of EdTech, @5511982667030  is right now teaching as a professor for a engineering university in Brazil with its curriculum designed by a Stanford professor. I wonder if @8618926086648 might know if anyone on the education vertical in China too. 



Regarding the offshore dev house idea, @919158729122 and @6581766589 have operations in India and might be interesting to speak to 

If I am not wrong @19514467219 is part of the ski shoe manufacturing supply chain project where we are trying to tokenize commodities required for ski shoe manufacturing on chain. He is also very familiar with the circular economy design 

I wonder if these two categories of commodities could be tokenized on the same chain. Just food food for thought
[9/5/22, 2:22:57 PM] Francois renet: Thanks for the invite Gary. Great chatting about FaaS with you last week!
[9/5/22, 3:03:46 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! 🤩
[9/5/22, 6:43:44 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Please let me know a convenient time to speak
[9/5/22, 8:37:17 PM] Gary Teh: @6581766589 and @16506464893

I have creates a project specific channel for the agriculture related project. Let’s follow up over there and conserve the attention bandwidth of our network members. 

Will pull in more members to that project group once we get more details through our discussions 😁👍

[9/5/22, 8:42:13 PM] Gary Teh: Past two years pursuing the northern lights ended in failure. I strongly believe third time is the charm 🤩

[9/5/22, 11:55:07 PM] Gary Teh: I am starting to wonder if it has to do with the recent solar flare

[9/5/22, 11:55:57 PM] Aga - DAOist: "Don't look up!"
[9/6/22, 12:08:40 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps… 🤔
[9/6/22, 12:35:19 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just go above North 70 lat bro. Stay in that zone awhile. And u will see it
[9/6/22, 12:35:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: Seen couple of times already
‎[9/6/22, 12:37:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: ‎image omitted
[9/6/22, 12:38:35 AM] Gary Teh: Ok bro! Was just reading up on that route that google maps directed me. 

Dalton Highway seems like an extreme adventure route. I wonder if my Toyota Camry is really equipped to make it all the way to the very very end of the road 🤣
[9/6/22, 12:38:57 AM] Gary Teh: Nice bro! I think I should go pick up a tripod at Walmart tomorrow
[9/6/22, 12:39:28 AM] Gary Teh: https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/usa/50-james-dalton-highway-usa.html
[9/6/22, 12:40:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: And it’s visible as the photo. Unlike fake northern light photography where they overexpose photos to show lights not visible to the naked eye. The key to knowing fake photographies. Is how bright the foreground is. If the ground is artificially bright (not from the illumination of the northern lights or from a camera flash), then the northern lights is just over exposed to make it bright
[9/6/22, 12:40:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: Make sure where u are going is above North 70
[9/6/22, 12:41:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: That is called the Arctic circle.
[9/6/22, 12:41:37 AM] Kelvin Chew: That’s where it’s easiest to see lights even with Aurora index of 0-2

[9/6/22, 12:44:19 AM] Gary Teh: What a true sight!! 🤩
[9/6/22, 12:45:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: See the difference? And my ground was illuminated from the eerie green of the lights itself. Big difference
[9/6/22, 12:46:16 AM] Jonathan: My wife is good with fruits and vegetables out of Yunnan. I know a really good person in edtech who was the head of English First for quite a few years in China,.
[9/6/22, 12:48:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: Get super alpaca socks bro. What killed me was my feet standing on ice.
[9/6/22, 12:49:14 AM] Gary Teh: Very nice bro! 
Me, @16506464893 and @6581766589 scheduling a call early next Monday to talk through the tech side first to figure out if there are any technology gaps that needs to be filled on the blockchain layer 

Then we will start looking into the Buy side to figure out the demand situation. 

Will reach out to Brian to find out the Agritech AI startup he invested in a while ago to dig deeper into their business model.
[9/6/22, 12:49:28 AM] Gary Teh: Yup, I got two of those handy in my car
[9/6/22, 12:57:13 AM] Jonathan: Here is the English First head: https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterwinn/
[9/6/22, 1:00:22 AM] Gary Teh: Thanks for the introduction bro! 😁👍
[9/6/22, 1:02:34 AM] Jonathan: He has an interest in web3 but not fully in the industry.. never been to an OffChain event ;)
[9/6/22, 1:12:00 AM] Marvin: My hometown in Germany was hotter than Dubai at some points this year without ACs anywhere :( that’s the worst thing about Europe, same in France, Netherlands, or the UK, ACs are basically nonexistent
[9/6/22, 1:58:58 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: damn!
[9/6/22, 2:18:32 AM] Francois renet: i can say that for CH too! 39 degrees by the lake and no respite from the heat as there was no wind!
[9/6/22, 5:47:17 AM] Tres Garcia: Document the journey & send it to Toyota. You will have a sponsor in no time!
[9/6/22, 6:32:41 AM] Abhinav: @14153000019 few things to keep in mind for Dalton Highway
1. AWD is kind of a must. Road has lots of gravel
2. Remember the last gas stop. Tank full there. 
3. You need to carry the containers to carry the extra gas. The distance is a lot. 
4. Polar Bears.
[9/6/22, 6:43:59 AM] Gary Teh: Ok! 😁👍
[9/6/22, 6:44:24 AM] Gary Teh: Sure!
[9/6/22, 6:45:52 AM] TUSHAR SHARMA: Wow seems interesting ride!
[9/6/22, 6:47:21 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s see how far we could push the Toyota Camry before I do the U-Turn. 🤣
[9/6/22, 6:47:47 AM] Peter Peng: How many miles on that thing?
[9/6/22, 6:47:58 AM] Gary Teh: 200k
[9/6/22, 6:48:12 AM] Gary Teh: These Japanese cars past forever
[9/6/22, 6:48:15 AM] Peter Peng: You’ve got plants of miles
[9/6/22, 6:48:24 AM] Peter Peng: Plenty
[9/6/22, 6:48:29 AM] TUSHAR SHARMA: All the best Bro 👍
[9/6/22, 6:49:28 AM] Gary Teh: The previous car which I did the perimeter of the US was a Honda Civic hybrid. That baby has 300k miles on it. 

A few friends were warning me not to do that trip in the Honda. Guess it worked though 🤔🤣
[9/6/22, 6:50:10 AM] Gary Teh: Until some dude Tboned into it in middle of nowhere Texas
[9/6/22, 6:56:31 AM] Gary Teh: I wonder if anyone knows someone on the marketing team in Toyota. It would definitely be interesting to raise some funds from them for our DAO with the contents from this trip of any. We could use those funds to finance our environmental sustainability related project projects like the one that is slowly starting up now lead by @16506464893 😁👍
[9/6/22, 6:58:35 AM] Gary Teh: I think the angle of interest would be “what is the state of our Article circle now that the northern hemisphere is baking in inhuman heat wave”? 

@16506464893 mentioned that climate change has caused some portions of the world which were agricultural land to be no longer viable. That said other lands which were not viable might start becoming so 🤔
[9/6/22, 9:22:15 AM] Gary Teh: Just had a great chat with @19514467219 just now. I think he suggested a really great idea to do a live stream of the northern lights once I see it. 

On a separate note, we realized Hans Martin also has a working prototype of an entire green house with all the supply chain in place in Switzerland. 

@19514467219 will be surfacing the Agritech idea to him as something we should present in the House of Balance at WEF, Davos early next year

Things are definitely starting to come together with a lot of synergy 

Adding @19514467219 to the Agritech project group now. We will provide more updates here as and when we have some 😁👍
[9/6/22, 12:41:38 PM] Gary Teh: Just realized it was @48606646246 who first surfaced the notion of self sustaining agricultural clusters during our conversations. 

Had a chat with her just now. She is looking to setup a similar structure in Spain too. 

This pattern is really becoming more and more apparent as time passes 😁👍
[9/6/22, 12:45:13 PM] Aga - DAOist: Btw I spoke to that guy who has that platform to structure knowledge into a process and the topic of creating a self-sustainable communities feels like a perfect subject to describe :) 

I am not an expert in the field but I would love to help structuring this knowledge with someone who has done it :)
[9/6/22, 12:46:21 PM] Sarah H.: I would love to be a member of a sustainable network of communities that support nomadic techies, artists, free thinkers
[9/6/22, 12:47:20 PM] Sarah H.: Where I know the food, water, and folks all have some alignments along making earth a better place with everyday actions.
[9/6/22, 12:47:50 PM] Francois renet: I'm talking to a group that may have the right structure. discussed it with @14153000019 earlier, and will report back after talking with founder
[9/6/22, 12:48:33 PM] Sarah H.: I have talked with a couple different groups with fractionalized islands and then land in the Mexican jungle
[9/6/22, 12:48:42 PM] Francois renet: key to all these endeavors is aggregation! We need to stop working in silos, it just divides!
[9/6/22, 12:49:31 PM] Sarah H.: It could be sustainable to get them all to participate in an over arching membership- and to be a providing community they would have to qualify
[9/6/22, 12:51:14 PM] Aga - DAOist: A lot of material is also in Moneyless Society organization. Michael have been already in contact with them.
[9/6/22, 12:51:40 PM] Francois renet: it could also help in sharing resources. Too many endeavors that try and find similar solutions in their own bubble, wasting time, funds, and slowing geographic expansions.
[9/6/22, 12:52:23 PM] Francois renet: @14153000019 mentioned during our call this pm
[9/6/22, 1:16:48 PM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 @48606646246 @48691650760 sounds like a recurring theme!!! 🤩🤣
[9/6/22, 1:20:25 PM] Francois renet: indeed!
[9/6/22, 1:57:54 PM] Aga - DAOist: That is our collective consciousness 🤩

Happy to be here ✨✨💛
[9/8/22, 10:22:28 AM] Aga - DAOist: Hello @18058259365!!! 🤗 

Dear Team, Yolanda is an amazing Life Coach for Creators and Artists, has great experience in speaking (also in radio), co-creates with us Infinitely Open Minds and we are also in brainstorming for creating a self-sustainable community in Spain 🤗

[9/8/22, 2:22:27 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Greetings Earthlings 👽🧘‍♂️🎉, I’ve been learning about how to build soil up and how hills can hold water. Also I’ve found we don’t need much to eat and that we heal immensely from fasting… 

Lastly to love the thing that you think is “bad” for those things set you free and help you to level up your vibration. 

Did I mention I deleted social media a few weeks ago and have had my phone off most of the time? 
It’s divine, I highly reccomend it, if you are considering it @16033124339 @48606646246 @13134136108 @919210068790 @14153000019 I lost nothing but improved my immediate situation significantly! 

You guys have to invite Brian here too!

Peace and Light 💗💫✌️
[9/8/22, 2:27:49 PM] Aga - DAOist: I thought Brian was here too 😅 He is in the Agro group but there I don't see you @17206665895 😅 

I will add you guys to each since @14153000019 gave me superpowers of an admin now when he is partially online 🤣
[9/8/22, 2:50:06 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: “Partially online” I like that!! Let’s make that normal @14153000019 @48606646246 💝🚀

However if he has some other agenda in mind, he will most likely reject my invitation 

Just for the fun of it, let’s do a quick poll, what do you think his likely response would be?

I am curious what she is going to do next 🤔
[9/8/22, 11:00:01 PM] Gary Teh: @6596983014 I had the most random idea. @48606646246 @919210068790 @18058259365 @17755088150 @48691650760 @17206665895 @447492703707 had a discussion Thursday on the Infinitely open minds chatroom where we decided to surface condensed key points from our discussions instead of the entire video which really really lengthy 

I wonder if we could use key themes as materials for Red Swords’ hero journey in her quest for the Truth? 🤔

[9/9/22, 3:21:20 AM] Gary Teh: The key insight I got after finishing the book was that if a gut feeling tells you the world depicted in a piece of art inspires a viewer to want to explore that world more, then perhaps it’s a good time to give the viewer the opportunity to more deeply explore it in story form. 

One thing I have also been very keen to explore is the notion of collective story telling.
[9/9/22, 3:21:34 AM] Gary Teh: Time to climb it!! 🤩

[9/9/22, 5:00:21 AM] Aga - DAOist: Wow, I see we will have more to talk about then 😁 my background is in transport & logistics (my master thesis was about Polish Airlines) and I have art interest too 😊 can't wait to meet you in person! 🤗

[9/9/22, 5:37:19 AM] Gary Teh: Well… technically laws are humsn written code… sometimes when “refactoring” them to new ones you might accidentally “break” them 🤔
[9/9/22, 5:41:24 AM] Aga - DAOist: I want to see you explaining it here to police officers when you go climbing this Eiffel Tower 🤣
[9/9/22, 5:45:33 AM] Francois renet: i still have some contacts with the police in case you try it! 😂
[9/9/22, 6:26:15 AM] Aga - DAOist: I guess challenge accepted then @14153000019 🤣
[9/9/22, 6:29:08 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s do it! 🤣

Well, I kind of already did that on a separate occasion two mornings  ago while we were chatting via FaceTime when the local law enforcer drove up to my car and asked if I was a resident??

Technically I was not breaking their law. It’s just that what I was doing was right on the edge and slightly beyond that the rules are undefined yet. And the law enforcer had no idea how to act. 🤔
[9/9/22, 6:42:06 AM] Gary Teh: After messing around with technology for quite a while this is what I am starting to realize. Laws tend to be reactionary. 

And similar to code, modifying existing ones tend to be more tedious than creating new codes especially when you want to be a responsible member of society and ensure existing systems don’t break. 

If you figure out where the edge is and then go beyond that where things are yet defined, there is a lot of wide open space that you could use as your playground to experiment whatever crazy idea as you please. 

A good example is if you imagined the internet back in the 90s. It was yet defined. societies don’t even know how to think about it yet much less how to legislate it via their governments. It is only after nearly three decades of its existence that governments start realizing what it is and how it should be regulated 

Another interesting example is burning man. It all started out with a bunch of folks wanting to do something funny like burning a straw man on the beach during the summer solstice and anyone can participate. Fast forward 50 years, it got so popular and the entry price has became so crazy because of the expenses incurred that is required to fulfill all the rules and regulations it is starting to shift from the spectrum of inclusiveness to become exclusive

Seems the hypothesized correlation is starting to play out. The drought trend that spiked last month is starting to translate into reports of supply shortage in some areas of the world. 

I sense food security will probably become a major theme for next year. 

The conversation that occurred this morning within the Agrihood group seem to suggest a decentralized network of sorts for food similar to the Helium network

Other times you end up with master pieces like this. 

From my perspective, I think the important thing is to really enjoy the process of discovery. Too much focus on the outcome of it just leaves you “burnt out” which is a common theme I hear from former folks in the Web2.0 space trying to build their next unicorn startup
[9/9/22, 8:30:41 PM] Gary Teh: One funny thing I observe about traditional investors is they generally don’t like to hear this even though that is statistically more likely to happen than not. 🤣

My guess is that they have a lithium battery in the device that supplies the 58.6 watts needed to run the TV for a short time. (minutes).

[9/11/22, 8:33:58 PM] Gary Teh: I was giving more thoughts to this on my drive just now. There are only 3 questions we need to focus on. 

1. To the independent signaler. “Are you willing to get paid everytime someone tries to check your past three months Twitter signals for accuracy?”

2. To a random person “Are you willing to get paid whenever you help us label either Bullish or Bearish the contents of a tweet pertaining to a stock symbol?”

3. To a potential follower “Are you willing to pay a small sum to get a peace of mind that the influencer whose trading signals you are about to follow has been pretty accurate these past 3 months?”

If it’s a YES to all three, then we have a viable economic model to work off of. 

@12023686334 thanks for independently reinforcing the signal that was surfaced by @6590995199 and Junaid 

Just for the fun of it. How optimistic are you that this model might actually work? 

❤️ - will need probably work 
🤣 - probably not work

[9/12/22, 7:29:13 PM] Gary Teh: In our next step, let's focus on validating hypothesis statement 3. This statement is targeted at the follower profiles. 

"Are you willing to pay a small sum to get a peace of mind that the influencer whose trading signals you are about to follow has been pretty accurate these past 3 months?"

Unpacking statement 3 yields the following behavior that need to prove true for our model to work.

1 - Do you ever rely on the signals published by Twitter community members in your trade?
2 - Is it important to know the historical accuracy of the member whom you intend to follow?
3 - are you willing to pay USD5 to quickly know if the member has had historically good accuracy?

Would be great if I could get some help to conduct this survey. the faster we can get the data in, the faster we can move on to prove the next part of our project's business model. I believe getting responses from around 50 respondents will be more than sufficient for this part. 🙂

[9/13/22, 6:04:38 PM] Gary Teh: I am thinking of running a follow up experiment after this. 

Guiding insights 
———
1. social recognition is a major motivation for independent FinTwit independent signalers 

2. Participants are not willing to engage with website they are not familiar with

The premise
———
Right now you have nothing to show even if you choose the right outcome on Twitter poll since identity of participants are all private 

The experiment 
———
For the upcoming poll, participants will be given the opportunity to purchase either a Bullish NFT or a Bearish NFT associated specifically with the poll. 

There will only be a total of 2 NFTs. One Bullish, the other Bearish. They will both be listed for sale on OpenSea

The assumption
———
A subset of the participants will feel inclined to purchase an NFT to notarize their polls.

What is your hunch?
———
❤️ - an NFT sale will occur
🤣 - we hear crickets
[9/13/22, 9:20:36 PM] Tres Garcia: I love this ☝️
[9/13/22, 9:42:22 PM] TUSHAR SHARMA: Nice insights Gary👍
[9/13/22, 10:47:10 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, if you are starting to wonder why we are running experiments, after experiments after experiments within our DAO instead of “building” code/application, I wrote a short piece explaining the reason for this 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyjob_web3community-dao-nfts-activity-6975636320211677184-4Jpt

As mentioned previously, “code” is formalized declaration of actual state of things. 

With that in mind, first we figure out what is “reasonable” to ask of the “community” in terms of the actions required of them. Then and only then do we start laying down the roads. 

It is really wasteful to utilize resources from the community to lay down a new piece of road leading into the middle nowhere when no one in the community really cares about heading in that direction 🤣

So technically, we could do the same by measuring the conversion rate of the advertisement for the unique value proposition targeted at FinTwit independent signalers profile 

The two critical spooks of the three sided market place can be validated with just USD100. Experiments are so cheap when structured properly 🤔🤣

[9/16/22, 12:24:19 PM] Gary Teh: By the way @48606646246 and @447492703707 are floating an idea of creating a DAO to facilitate company research 


there are a bunch of company listings on the BUY side on Craigslist in different cities 🙂

https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?query=paid+study+research

As a simple experiment, we could pick one listing and then do a minimal viable test of a tokenomics that would work to attract the SELL side to come participate 

If we are able to get a minimal viable loop working (matching both BUY side and SELL side) going then we know the new DAO will be economically viable right out the gates 

The key is to figure out a tokenomics that would incentize DAO members to do the following action 

- source for and coordinate with companies that need research 
- source for participants that match research needs
- participate in the research
[9/16/22, 12:26:09 PM] Gary Teh: Getting the link for the discord server where the discussion is happening. Will share here once I figured out which one 🙂
[9/16/22, 12:27:19 PM] Tres Garcia: Kismet….. I was literally just talking about something similar the other day.
[9/16/22, 12:28:49 PM] Gary Teh: https://discord.gg/a6UBYGR2
[9/16/22, 12:29:00 PM] Gary Teh: Is kismet an existing project?
[9/16/22, 12:34:23 PM] Tres Garcia: It could be.... I like the name. 

kis·met
/ˈkizmit,ˈkizˌmet/
Learn to pronounce
noun
destiny; fate.
"what chance did I stand against kismet?"
[9/16/22, 12:34:39 PM] Tres Garcia: I figure it is why we are all here.
[9/16/22, 12:38:03 PM] Brian -IOM: Would be a good test for proof of concept. I wonder if the real juice is in getting big players to pay an annual subscription to have the DAO’s collective expertise on tap so to speak.
[9/16/22, 12:42:38 PM] Jenni: ‎You added Jenni
[9/16/22, 12:43:12 PM] Brian -IOM: Would Outlier Ventures for example pay $50k a year to have access to focus groups comprised of people with specific expertise in web3/crypto/fintech/metaverse
[9/16/22, 12:44:06 PM] Brian -IOM: Or MasterCard
[9/16/22, 12:47:00 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I started noticing an interesting phenomena after decoupling TrueSight DAO network from the mission of fighting fake news and then introducing more Web3 projects into the network that are values aligned. 

Problem
———
Web3 project leaders generally are missing key resource of one form or another to be able to have a minimal viable working business model built.

To fill up the gaps for their business model to, they often rely upon warm introduction by folks in their network to key resource owners. 

The reason why warm introductions are important is because key resource owners are often bombard by multiple requests as such they only respond to introductions from trusted sources whom they have known for years

Warm introductions are valuable but these important connectors are not compensated for their “efforts”. Hence there is usually a lack of incentive to do so 

Idea
———
This idea was first floated by @19514467219 back when we were in Davos I think it is start to make sense and perhaps economically viable and worthy of testing. 


This is how the tokenomics will look like 
To get a warm introduction, project owners should deposit USD5,000 worth of their own project tokens in the vault of TrueSight DAO. 

DAO members who are keen to help make the introductions will be awarded 45% of the amount in DAO governance tokens, 

the remaining 45% of the amount  will be awarded to key resource owner accepted the introduction. 

The final 10% of the amount is kept as gas fee to boost the value of DAO governance tokens 

Implications
———
If this model works then it could be easily replicated to the OffChain global network that @8618926086648 and @14152032783 are focused 

It could also be easily replicated to the ESG network that @6594257747 is part of
[9/16/22, 12:49:48 PM] Gary Teh: So now, we technically have two models we can test 

1. Focus group focused DAO model that @48606646246 and @447492703707 are focused on (consumer focused)

2. The warm introduction DAO model (enterprise focused)

[9/16/22, 12:52:48 PM] Gary Teh: If you ever read the book “Think and Grow Rich” the final chapter of the book describes how the author as part of his job sometimes locks himself in a dark room for hours without any external stimulus. Basically all the attention is freed up to allow the mind to start synthesizing all the materials gathered so far from research activities
[9/16/22, 12:54:22 PM] Gary Teh: I guess past few days of zero stimulus / no internet connection were basically free time slots to mentally iterate through all the different plausible models given the raw data I have acquired these few weeks 

So I guess the next steps are to test the viability of these models 🙂👍
[9/16/22, 12:55:39 PM] Gary Teh: Starting next Monday, I will start populating our pipeline with introduction needs 🙂👍

I think the patterns matches 

Soul bound tokens are a while away still. Before that I believe we could use governance tokens from each DAO as a proxy. 

In the case of the TrueSight DAO tokens, we could use it as a proxy for how much an individual has contributed to a warm introduction network 

In the case of Focus DAO, a proxy for how much an individual has contributed to a research network 🙂

Definitely if you are keen to participate in the focus DAO, this is the link 

https://discord.gg/a6UBYGR2
[9/16/22, 5:30:16 PM] Gary Teh: I wonder if we should do the following to both conserve the attention of the network as well as ensure resource owners receive quality Web3 project introductions? It is a process similar to that @14153096839 ran when he headed the product management team in Edmodo. 

Here is the proposed format
———
1 Web3 project will be surfaced each week on Monday 

From Monday to Thursday  network members can freely examine and constructively critique the project for key weaknesses in their business model. 

While it is unsettling to see your brain child surgically dissected, the goal of project owners is not to defend but to be receptive to identified key weaknesses. They can go figure out how to patch it up offline later. Time is the most valuable resource any project owner has. Being able to save cycles from a weak model to spent on a stronger model is valuable 

The connectors who go on to make the warm introduction can also have a peace of mind, he/she is not negatively affecting his/her credibility by not having clarity on the strength and weaknesses of the underlying business model 

❤️ - add in this as part of the process
😯 - too painful let’s not do this
[9/16/22, 8:29:29 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: A great jumping off point in my opinion… if everyone is in. Thanks! Stay warm in your igloo! 😂✌️

[9/17/22, 6:07:29 PM] Gary Teh: There seems to be a slow exodus of failed crypto whales from Singapore right now. 

First were the founders of Three Arrow crypto fund and now Do Kwon founder of Luna and Terra

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-17/luna-and-terra-s-do-kwon-not-in-singapore-local-police-say

It is interesting to note that Vitalik in his research paper expressed a somewhat negative sentiment towards DeFi calling it authoritian leaning much like current Web2.0 trends.
[9/18/22, 1:08:53 AM] Francois renet: The exodus is global. I have heard of multiple billion private sale deals of bitcoins with a handful of people buying very large chunks. And there is a growing rumble of major nations getting ready to issue digital currencies. Once that happens. Bye bye crypto. As far as DeFi goes do the numbers of 0.1% of people owning over 80% of the digital wealth speak to a fairer distribution? I think not. Just a humble opinion
[9/18/22, 1:16:41 AM] Aga - DAOist: Well said Francois! I keep repeating the same. One big illusion... decentralizing technology doesn't mean the wealth and power distribution changes, especially that mindset drives the same way..
[9/18/22, 1:34:51 AM] Francois renet: Exactly Aga! Whether Web2 or 3, anonymity and regional decentralization just allow for more bad actors to operate in total impunity with no control whatsoever. My wealthy uncle in Africa who used to send me emails that he had 30M waiting for me in exchange for just a couple of thousands is a joke compared to what’s going on today! Until we actually start affecting human nature for good, we are just spinning our wheels!
[9/18/22, 1:42:24 AM] Aga - DAOist: There are couple of aspects of decentralization to consider. For example, transparency will benefit who? And to whom should it be directed? I am not a fan of sharing every activity online for the sake of transparency... My life and nobody should even care.. Transparent should be organizations and governments that take our money and spend it wherever... People should be free. And what is the narrative now? Where is the hype created?...
[9/18/22, 1:46:44 AM] Francois renet: Agreed @48606646246 ! the visible, and invisible, opacity that surrounds governments needs to change, as per the definition of democracy "for the people by the people". today's narrative and hype around social media, and media in general, means that we couldn't even have a revolution if we tried. people have thousands of social media friends, whilst being isolated IRL. we don't need to create a Metaverse, we're living in it already!
[9/18/22, 1:52:29 AM] Aga - DAOist: Couple if things to put straight after all this mess done 😅 and we can do it, with a good strategy and new mindset.. 💪
[9/18/22, 1:53:27 AM] Francois renet: and that is why i am so excited about the venture we discussed last week @aga! positive minsets make for positive outcomes!
[9/18/22, 6:58:28 AM] Tres Garcia: Sounds like my uncle from Nigeria.  I keep sending him money with no expectations because he’s family but he just keeps getting into trouble. 🐑
[9/18/22, 7:00:41 AM] Tres Garcia: Crypto will never “take off” unless it’s seamless with our current metaverse. 

The cbdc will do this because it has the infrastructure & support of govt and big businesses. 

El Salvador could have done it, but the tech is too new and does not have the resources to make it better.
[9/18/22, 7:01:55 AM] Tres Garcia: To their credit, they achieved mass signup of accounts vs the imf that has been trying to get people to get Bank accounts for years.
[9/18/22, 7:14:19 AM] Francois renet: good point. this whole bank account situation is terrible, as is credit scores, it's like a giant foot on the head of those drowning already!
[9/18/22, 10:46:53 AM] Gary Teh: Is this the new concept that will support NGOs?
[9/18/22, 10:47:43 AM] Gary Teh: How do we create a symbiotic relationship with them as well as the other platforms you are surfacing 🙂
[9/18/22, 10:52:25 AM] Gary Teh: it would be great if we could brain/heartstorm on some more models that might work that we could trial test. 

This should provide us with viable alternatives to help us move away from bank accounts and credit scores as @19514467219 proposed 🙂
[9/18/22, 12:26:39 PM] Francois renet: yes
[9/18/22, 12:27:33 PM] Francois renet: let me see. I met some great guys in the space in CH on Thursday. They have solutions. I need to assess
[9/18/22, 12:28:34 PM] Aga - DAOist: I have quite a lot in my head and heart for this topic.. happy to dicuss it with those who want to make it 😁
[9/18/22, 12:30:14 PM] Francois renet: there needs to be a fairer way to "weigh" the risks of credit. How is it that a billionaire has 1% credit card rate, and someone drowning is getting 30%, and WHY are goverments allowing it?? There is a big difference between people who have a bad credit score because they are reckless, nd those who do because they are literally living off of nothing!
[9/18/22, 12:32:32 PM] Tres Garcia: Risk and the probability of paying back mixed with willingness to pay.
[9/18/22, 12:33:05 PM] Aga - DAOist: The whole idea of living from credit is putting us in low vibrations... The whole logic behind this system is up side down for a reason..
[9/18/22, 12:33:07 PM] Tres Garcia: They want you to miss payments and keep a balance. It’s how they make money.
[9/18/22, 12:33:50 PM] Tres Garcia: I think an EU mindset is the best approach to tackling the US CCD problem.
[9/18/22, 12:34:06 PM] Tres Garcia: Only buy what you can afford
[9/18/22, 12:36:41 PM] Francois renet: problem is people won't be able to afford the strict minimum such as power and food
[9/18/22, 1:57:23 PM] Tres Garcia: 🇷🇺 gas
Fair point!
[9/18/22, 1:57:45 PM] Tres Garcia: I am hoping for a warm winter.
[9/18/22, 1:58:16 PM] Francois renet: i believe the conflict will end soon
[9/18/22, 1:59:29 PM] Tres Garcia: I still can't figure out why they attacked... So no clue here.
[9/18/22, 2:02:05 PM] Francois renet: rare earth minerals - Ukraine has one of the largest reserves in most of them. and China needed them.
[9/18/22, 2:05:48 PM] Gary Teh: from your perspective it had nothing to do with Ukraine intending to join NATO and EU?
[9/18/22, 2:08:39 PM] Francois renet: The odds of the EU accepting Ukraine were very slim, and it was a long process. Yes, being part of NATO was an issue, for Russia but ultimately they are getting all their weapons from the US which Putin could also choose to define as a transgression to escalate the war, but he hasn't done so
[9/18/22, 2:13:09 PM] Gary Teh: @6590995199 had a different theory too which was an attempt by the US to disrupt one of the nord stream 2 pipeline from coming online which was overall bad business for American exports.
[9/18/22, 2:13:38 PM] Gary Teh: Based on his theory, US was goading Russia into aggression the few months before Russia got annoyed.
[9/18/22, 2:14:24 PM] Francois renet: There is also the theory that the US is using Ukraine as the test ground for their latest weapon developments...
[9/18/22, 2:15:08 PM] Tres Garcia: When I get annoyed I walk my dog…. I don’t send a division into enemy territory with out proper logical support.
[9/18/22, 2:15:35 PM] Francois renet: absolutely, and i cannot understand why European leaders allowed them to do so! I also heard that when Boris Johnson went to visit Ukraine, it was as a messenger for the US
[9/18/22, 2:16:10 PM] Tres Garcia: No. It’s all old tech. Check out Iraq 2003 SOF vs Iraq tank BN. 

The cyber stuff is new. (But mostly 🇷🇺)
[9/18/22, 2:16:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: Yes I said this. Ukraine can die in a nuclear fury hell and nobody really cares. The west wants to stop Russia’s NS2. Russia just wants to sell oil. And the whole thing escalated from there.
[9/18/22, 2:16:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ukraine was simply a pawn in this whole struggle for oil dominance
[9/18/22, 2:17:15 PM] Francois renet: this is about geographical manipulation, and proxy wars. with a very big dose of disinformation...
[9/18/22, 2:17:34 PM] Tres Garcia: Sounds about right
[9/18/22, 2:17:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just like Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction that was never found. It was just an excuse for an oil grab.
[9/18/22, 2:18:00 PM] Francois renet: russia is still selling oil. in masses, it's just rerefined and the provenance is changed
[9/18/22, 2:18:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: Correct. Because the Asian market refused the cancel culture west wanted
‎[9/18/22, 2:18:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: ‎image omitted
‎[9/18/22, 2:18:56 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎GIF omitted
[9/18/22, 2:19:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: In fact. Russia is not selling any less than before.
[9/18/22, 2:19:35 PM] Francois renet: make no mistake about it, it is not just Asia that is buying russian oil...as long as it doesn't look or smell russian...well then it's a go!
[9/18/22, 2:19:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: This proxy war destroyed usa big time.
[9/18/22, 2:21:07 PM] Francois renet: which is why my belief is that they are currently using back channels to offer cash to the russian generals, supported by the oligarchs to bring the conflict to an end. without the army, Putin is nothing, and all the guys he made wealthy are losing everything, so he has lost their support as well
[9/18/22, 2:23:39 PM] Gary Teh: Which part of the USA is damaged in this war?
[9/18/22, 2:24:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: 1) it jeopardise the Petro dollar and lost 40% of the entire European source in a single stroke. 
2) it showed the world that the world reserve currency is not war immune. Hence. Why should I hold USD if it’s not a safe haven
3) that the Swift system can be weaponised and hence any country should start finding alternatives just in case
4) that gold and usd kept in usa can be confiscated so it Tbills held by foreign countries like China and Russia should start their deleveraging 
5) showed the world that Venezuela and Saudi can give usa the middle finger when usa demanded oil from them
6)  that assets in usa and western soil is prone to confiscation even if you are not directly involved in the war
7) caused BRICS to form
8) inflation surge due to commodities supply. 
9) self inflected supply shock of Nat gas for this winter. 


And much more
[9/18/22, 2:26:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: 10) and don’t forget the hundreds of American companies with asset freeze in Russia and lost of equity and revenue from pulling businesses
[9/18/22, 2:26:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: No. Usa lost this war. Big time
‎[9/18/22, 2:27:22 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎image omitted
[9/18/22, 2:27:33 PM] Tres Garcia: Everything else is spot on.
[9/18/22, 2:27:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: Valid. USD is up cos euro and pounds flee west
[9/18/22, 2:28:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: Look at China and Russia usd supply
[9/18/22, 2:28:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s reducing
[9/18/22, 2:28:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Intentionally
[9/18/22, 2:28:38 PM] Tres Garcia: May not be at the level of dispare.. but just give it more time & Kevin's top 10 will = Nostradamus!
[9/18/22, 2:29:20 PM] Francois renet: indeed. replaced with huge quantities of gold purchases. that sovereign countries need to sell to put cash in their system
[9/18/22, 2:29:27 PM] Tres Garcia: All in all I think everything is going to be alright.
[9/18/22, 2:29:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: On top of that. Multiple countries are reporting Yuan as a basket of foreign reserves
[9/18/22, 2:30:33 PM] Francois renet: digital currencies coming online soon...USD, Yuan, Rupee...
[9/18/22, 2:30:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t forget 11) nato states are fracturing. 

European countries are pivoting to Russian gas already.
[9/18/22, 2:31:39 PM] Nelson ✨: It’s an extremely complex topic, with Geographic, Financial, Military and even cultural reasons.
[9/18/22, 2:31:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Meanwhile Russian is earning loads. 

Russian alliance with China just got stronger

China with the 2nd most gdp and POPULATION on earth

Russia with the biggest landmass on earth. 

You wanna cancel both of them. Come on. Who are you kidding
[9/18/22, 2:33:37 PM] Nelson ✨: If you have any specific questions about Ukraine or (as I read before) El Salvador, please let me know and tag me :)
[9/18/22, 2:35:39 PM] Nelson ✨: I’m Salvadorean, and consulting the government around crypto.

And Ukraine, I know less, but my fiancé is Ukranian (so I can give explain you her perspective), been there to visit, even to rescue family from my fiancé 5 months ago with a rented car, and I’ve witnessed the Russian non-sense in Eastern European countries since several years.
[9/18/22, 2:35:55 PM] Nelson ✨: Ukrainian*
[9/18/22, 2:37:05 PM] Tres Garcia: So should I start Russian or Mandarin language classes? I am betting on Chinese.
[9/18/22, 2:37:58 PM] Nelson ✨: English + Spanish = Best mix ;)
For business + travel purposes
‎[9/18/22, 2:39:41 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/18/22, 2:41:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: In short

1) 40% of European gas is from Russia

2) therefore 60% is from a combination of UK, Norway, USA etc. western controlled

3) nord stream 2 (NS2)will increase that 40% which in turn reduces demand on the 60%

4) the west doesn’t wanna lose profitable oil business so tries to stop NS2. 

5) remember trump went to Germany to protest NS2? He got laughed at. 

6) NS2 was completed sept 2021 and was set to be operational March 2022. Look at the timing. 

7) Ukraine has always been deemed the final line which Putin protested nato advancement for years. And Ukraine said nato was a potential join for 14 years. 

8) Ukrainian pres is a known puppet for a billionaire who has ties with usa. 

9) together triggers ukraine to join nato which draws Russians to the border

10) France and Italy sent presidents to Moscow to persuade Russia to stop. Nothing happened. But when Germany went to Moscow, came back the next day and declared NS2 project cancelled. Within 24 hours Russia attacked. 

So why they attacked? 

3 words

NORD STREAM 2
[9/18/22, 2:42:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Look at Putins demands now
[9/18/22, 2:42:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: He has a few
[9/18/22, 2:43:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: 1) stop sanctions the war ends
[9/18/22, 2:43:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2) if europe needs gas? Turn on NS2. Not NS1 mind u. There is “equipment failure” in NS1. Turn NS2 ON
[9/18/22, 2:44:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s it. Those are the two conditions for the war to end
[9/18/22, 2:44:46 PM] Nelson ✨: This plays a role, but doesn’t describe the entire picture
[9/18/22, 2:45:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: And the west would rather not use Russian gas. And leave Ukrainians to the mercy of Russian weapons. When they have every power to stop the war. 

Switch on the tap. Stop sanctions. The war ends. 

So the west has the ability to stop. But it doesn’t want to. So therefore ukraine can burn and it won’t matter to the west.
[9/18/22, 2:45:53 PM] Nelson ✨: You can’t possibly believe Putin’s demands; that’s his short-term game. He would continue to attack Ukraine as soon as he has the Russian army ready again.
[9/18/22, 2:46:33 PM] Gary Teh: Folks seem a crazy weather pattern is also impacting huge parts of Alaska right now

This is a great time to verify if this news is Fake! Let's do a poll before I pick a direction and start driving on Monday

❤️ - Drive there and go check it out!
🤣 - Get the F**K out right now!
[9/18/22, 2:46:35 PM] Francois renet: i will repeat. Putin is going to lose the support of the army.
[9/18/22, 2:46:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: 2014 crimea war WAS in ukraine. Lol. U tell me for 8 years he stalled his war? Waiting for what?
[9/18/22, 2:46:49 PM] Nelson ✨: The battle stops; the war wouldn’t end.
[9/18/22, 2:47:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway. It’s always oil.
[9/18/22, 2:49:00 PM] Nelson ✨: They are truly demoralized already. I mean, they have nothing to fight for…
Most of the Russians are brainwashed since their first day of school. Source, several talks with people from Russian, been there twice and got to talk with prople from the middle class.
[9/18/22, 2:50:21 PM] Nelson ✨: Kelvin, this is a very narrow view :)

Imagine the conflict in Israel; it’s also a complex topic that can’t be described with a single cause.
[9/18/22, 2:51:38 PM] Aga - DAOist: Well... we are very much brainwashed too... I wouldn't laugh at Russians only... 😅 my country is close enough to Russia and Ukraine to see more than what you all get on media...
[9/18/22, 2:52:38 PM] Nelson ✨: You have to know what happened in Ukraine in those 8 years; specifically talking about politics - again, complex topic my friend :)
[9/18/22, 2:52:44 PM] Francois renet: agreed.
[9/18/22, 2:52:57 PM] Nelson ✨: USA? 🥲
[9/18/22, 2:54:09 PM] Francois renet: but then you have to look at everything that happened in Ukraine. not just one narrative
[9/18/22, 2:55:20 PM] Aga - DAOist: I am from Poland 😊
[9/18/22, 2:55:22 PM] Nelson ✨: Totally agree!

[9/18/22, 2:56:02 PM] Nelson ✨: The entire tv network and press xD
[9/18/22, 2:56:12 PM] Nelson ✨: I like Jackass 😂😂
[9/18/22, 2:56:21 PM] Nelson ✨: Awesome country!
[9/18/22, 3:00:41 PM] Aga - DAOist: But let's face the truth.. it is all one media giant ruling the narrative across countries... and then gov in Poland wanted to cut these media that are related to globalists and so in contra giants launched some other propaganda to "free media" 🤦‍♀️ neither gov nor globalists are providing truth so it is a crazy brainwashing.. one way or another 🤣
‎[9/18/22, 3:02:07 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/18/22, 3:02:19 PM] Aga - DAOist: Thank you 🙏 I appreciate Poland more when I experienced living in other countries 😅 if you want some action, start from Polish people 😁
[9/18/22, 3:02:27 PM] Gary Teh: We don't even know which pill is red. 🤣
[9/18/22, 3:02:42 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! 🤩
[9/18/22, 3:04:34 PM] Aga - DAOist: Do you believe that there is only black or white? One is right or one is wrong? What about all shades of gray in between? And what about all information that is not public in either of these narratives? 🤔
[9/18/22, 3:07:11 PM] Gary Teh: What a coincidence, I was just thinking about this yesterday while driving. 

I think the main problem Fake news and the polarization (since that is the intention of the disseminators anyway) is in the crystallization of these positions into a borderline authoritarian stance.
[9/18/22, 3:07:40 PM] Gary Teh: Recently, it seems like the space in between has all been sucked out, you can only either be for or against.
‎[9/18/22, 3:08:18 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/18/22, 3:30:34 PM] Francois renet: all the information that is not public is the black and the white,
[9/18/22, 3:32:07 PM] Aga - DAOist: And regarding all these storms.. do you know you can create them by implementation of energy in particular place?... It is interesting that it happens in Puerto Rico and Alaska... while US was interfeering so much in Russian-Ukrainian conflict...
[9/18/22, 3:33:24 PM] Francois renet: China proved it when they manipulated weather conditions for the Olympics. Now that is VERY frightening.
[9/18/22, 3:36:53 PM] Aga - DAOist: It is a matter of perception always. In our "programming" we are taught to think through polarity while in fact from a more absolut perspective everything is greyish, more neutral.. polarity was set to manipulate us and divide.. they know that our union will collaps this system 😅 
But well, this topic has also many dimentions and not so "black and white" 😅
[9/18/22, 3:38:04 PM] Francois renet: human nature versus human nurture!
[9/18/22, 3:39:44 PM] Aga - DAOist: That is why I would look at this from another perspective 🤔 it is a great coincidance or another fight back... considering the importance of both places to USA... 🤷‍♀️ I am just asking questions 😅 or... the universe brings the balance 😅
[9/18/22, 3:41:13 PM] Aga - DAOist: Actually... yes and no 😅 our human experience was indeed to find ourselves in the world of polarity while its purpose was to find the balance in it and progress 😅
[9/18/22, 3:42:33 PM] Francois renet: @48606646246 you are way to making sense for this late in the day! hat off to you! 🙂
[9/18/22, 3:46:04 PM] Gary Teh: Funny you also brought this up too. During our chat yesterday, @6594897484 was agonizing over why are Gary's movements/actions so totally unpredictable without any seeming coherent pattern to them. I just told him to stop thinking too much and act with pure gut feeling. 

Right now he is deliberating between going to East Timor for his first trip overseas after 9 years of being stuck in Singapore or potentially heading over to Antartica 🤩
[9/18/22, 3:46:17 PM] Aga - DAOist: 🙏🙏🙏 I energized myself today with some symbols and crystals 😅 I am happy to share some good energy if anyone is open (I am also a Reiki healer) 🤗
[9/18/22, 3:46:41 PM] Gary Teh: 🙋‍♂️
[9/18/22, 3:47:59 PM] Francois renet: Yes please!
[9/18/22, 3:49:12 PM] Aga - DAOist: I will text you in pm, prepare some glass of water to drink afterwards and lay down to relax 🤗
[9/18/22, 3:49:39 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! 🤩
[9/18/22, 3:50:07 PM] Francois renet: Ok!
[9/18/22, 7:15:09 PM] Gary Teh: I wonder how the world will theoretically look like if 50% of our global workforce gets removed within this decade. 🤔

Welcome dear to TrueSight DAO Network, officially 😍
[9/19/22, 11:28:29 AM] Gary Teh: Hi Jacki! Welcome to our network chatroom 🙂
[9/19/22, 11:34:19 AM] Gary Teh: Just saw this news today about open door and Zillow 

Home-Flipper Opendoor Hit With Losses in Echo of Zillow Collapse 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/home-flipper-opendoor-hit-with-losses-in-echo-of-zillow-collapse

I remember me and Ilya spending our time between 2015 to 2017 curating public data on the real estate market to train an AI to evaluate publicly listed real estate property prices for arbitrage opportunities in 8 US cities 

We started offers on new listings that fitted our criteria starting in 2018, however that was when these big boys started flooding into the market and going after the same deals we were targeting. 

Accessing the risk reward ratio, we ended up scraping the entire project in late 2019. 

I guess in hindsight, we had a great adventure and averted the disaster 🤣
[9/19/22, 11:56:37 AM] Jacki - Supply Chain: Thank you so much @48606646246 & @14153000019 !! Happy to contribute here :)
[9/19/22, 1:38:55 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Divine timing is always working for you!!
[9/19/22, 1:47:53 PM] Gary Teh: In hindsight, seems the case. 

Even this current trip up north. It’s like my movement is placing me right in the sweet between having to deal with too much crowd on one end and things turning south on the other
[9/19/22, 1:49:06 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: It’s always like that in hindsight! Which gives you confidence moving Now!
[9/19/22, 2:00:16 PM] Gary Teh: Been doing a cross reference between my configuration with the lunisolar charts the past two nights, what I am sensing now is there probably going to be some form of kinetic energy made available starting from the 8th of October which could be tapped for transmutation purposes. Just keeping my eyes open for that emergent wave, meanwhile am just chilling as I coast down the west coast back to Bay Area

[9/19/22, 4:22:26 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of car charging. I just got granted some “horse power” by the owner of club ippico in the form of a T-shirt sponsorship. 🤣 He and his friend also happened to be doing a road trip down alaska. They started from Las Ve

[9/19/22, 9:18:56 PM] Gary Teh: Out of 38 subjects approached, 2 expressed willingness to pay = 5% top of the funnel conversion rate 

Average price between the two is 20/USD a month 

Let’s assume they are retained for the full year. We are looking at an average life time value of USD240/year 

Let’s assume cost per click advertising for Twitter to be = USD0.5

Cost per acquisition = USD10

Technically, our return per acquisition will be around USD230 per acquired user 

We can pay out part of the portion to the signal providers being tracked and part of the portion of people helping us label the tweets and still have some surplus in our Vault 

Once we hit a sample 500 outreached subjects, we will roughly get a sense of what the conversion funnel would look like. 

Should probably take another week of manual work before I start deploying some cash to manually test the paid acquisition funnel 

This Zero to One growth hacking is always a very fun activity 🤣

[9/20/22, 12:11:59 AM] Gary Teh: Apparently this area is supposed to be a hunter’s paradise due to where it’s location. The “magic bus” original location is right at the very western edge of this hunting ground
[9/20/22, 1:42:10 AM] Aga - DAOist: Guys, if you would like to gain more self-confidence about your natural talents here I made a short post about genius report which is similar to Human Design but focuses on (co)working aspects 🤗 have fun! https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agamarecka_geniusreport-simply-younique-activity-6977894837458984960-1w_r?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

Not only do you get a report, but she has also created 1008 "Keys" to help you overcome weaknesses, emphasize strength, or remove your weaknesses from your path to success. https://geniuskey.com/
[9/20/22, 2:16:01 AM] Aga - DAOist: Great! There are also Gene Keys as far as I remember :) and of course astrological chart in general :)
[9/20/22, 2:19:00 AM] Aga - DAOist: The link to google store doesn't work 😔
[9/20/22, 2:20:11 AM] Francois renet: coming soon! dealing with the usual legal BS you have to in the States! BUT she is coming to Davos in January!
[9/20/22, 2:21:35 AM] Aga - DAOist: Ohh, ok then 😅 I will be happy to check it too 🤗 I am digging into this topic for some time now and it has been fascinating how much was "written in the stars" 😁
[9/20/22, 6:14:02 AM] Tres Garcia: That is genius

[9/20/22, 8:49:11 AM] Gary Teh: I saw those berries yesterday. Didn’t seem very tasty 🤔
[9/20/22, 8:49:57 AM] Gary Teh: It actually is not. Just the road totally sucks after the portion I took a photo of

Entire portion was underwater
[9/20/22, 8:50:57 AM] Gary Teh: @48606646246 and @19514467219 nice!! More human designs to use!!

Freed up even more time and resources to do stuff I really enjoy! 

And also a really great excuse to hand them off to folks who are more apt and motivated 🤣

[9/20/22, 10:38:47 AM] Gary Teh: @48606646246  thanks for making the introduction to Aleksa. 

Seems we will end up doing a token swap with Waceo and utilizing their legal facilities for our OffChain activities 

The original route we were going to take was way too expensive 🤣

https://TrueSight.me/setup

And based on the signals collected from our target audience, doesn’t seem like we will need to be implementing any prediction market mechanism and can totally do away with the gaming license requirements. So the final OffChain holdings structure will be greatly simplified from the original one! 🤩

https://TrueSight.me/holdings-structure
[9/20/22, 10:50:33 AM] Gary Teh: As for the OffChain revenue generated via Fiat currencies from our SAAS service subscribers, we will handle the collection using Stripe via TrueTech Inc (Delaware). 

TrueTech Inc will convert the surplus proceeds into one of the major cryptos and stake them in the liquidity pool along with our governance tokens on Raydium. 

Right now I am trying to figure out which is the best pair. Each has its trade offs in terms of usability and stability

Maybe let’s just do a poll here to decide on the Liquidity pair we want to use? Then I will just go ahead, setup the liquidity pool and deploy the USD5000 in our vault into that pool 🙂

❤️ - TDG and SOL 
🤣 - TDG and USDT
😯 - TDG and USDC

It offers very detailed step by step guide on how to setup the grounds for cultivating various strains of mushroom

[9/20/22, 8:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: Cool! Definitely popping by to visit on my way back to SF! Is harvesting season happening already?
[9/20/22, 11:41:35 PM] Gary Teh: Just looking at the overall trend now, I believe probably Europe is headed for a massive economic rebound in 2023. 

The Euro has almost fallen to parity compared to the USD. 

Every single person in my network (evenly spread across the whole world) who have headed for vacation in one way or another over the past few months all defaulted to Europe. 

I doubt the Russian Ukrainian war is going to last through this winter. Based on historical data, the only force that had ever thrive in an aggressive military position during the Russian winter was the Mongolian horde. They were built specifically for that climate condition. Both Hitler and Napoleon’s troops were wiped out. Oil price will ease up once war ends, supply chain disruptions will likewise ease. Food price will stay elevated for a while more due to the disrupted sowing cycle this year. 

If the EURO does not recover to its former level by 2023, I foresee more companies setting up operations there to capitalize on the disparity between talent and exchange rates. 

Let’s discuss 🙂
[9/20/22, 11:44:15 PM] Gary Teh: I believe the trade war between US and China will once again dominate headlines in 2023.
[9/20/22, 11:57:15 PM] Gary Teh: What are your thoughts about this article? 

https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/625180

❤️ - real news 
🤣 - fake news
[9/21/22, 12:19:25 AM] Francois renet: Agreed on end of war. I think pressure from the Douma combined with the loss of support from the army for Putin will be the end.
[9/21/22, 12:31:31 AM] Marvin: I think he wants to keep the regions where he holds the referendums now and then bring down the heat. India and China seem to lose their patience with Russia as well. What I find concerning, however, are his threats, if after the referendum he considers the territories to be Russian, he could use the Ukrainian defensive efforts to justify a nuclear strike
[9/21/22, 12:32:17 AM] Nelson ✨: The mycelium network makes me thing about the movie Avatar
[9/21/22, 12:44:18 AM] Gary Teh: Nuclear strike on Ukraine? 

What are your thoughts on Purim’s motivation in Ukraine?

❤️ - mostly economic concerns
😯 - mostly security concerns 
🤣 - mostly ideological concerns
[9/21/22, 12:45:28 AM] Nelson ✨: I will suggest the 🤡 instead of 🤣
[9/21/22, 12:45:50 AM] Nelson ✨: In this case definitely 🤡❤️
[9/21/22, 12:48:05 AM] Gary Teh: Which is stronger 🤡 or ❤️
[9/21/22, 12:48:14 AM] Aga - DAOist: Nothing is as it seems...
[9/21/22, 12:48:40 AM] Marvin: I’m going to go with D, psychological problems
[9/21/22, 12:49:57 AM] Marvin: I am scared that it might be in the realm of possibilities if the Ukraine tries to defend their territories and Russia would face “humiliation” otherwise. On the other hand, it could just be empty threats, I’m sure China would be furious if Russia would take it this far
[9/21/22, 12:53:16 AM] Marvin: I think a single tactical nuclear strike would be possible if Russia loses the territories they are holding now. Then they’d claim Russia’s integrity is under attack. I hope that it doesn’t come to that and it is extremely difficult for the west to respond to that
[9/21/22, 12:53:47 AM] Gary Teh: There doesn’t seem to be much ideology behind it. 

If it’s mostly economically concerns, launching a nuclear bomb doesn’t yield the desired outcome 

If it’s mostly security concerns, launching a nuclear war head doesn’t really serve the purpose of protecting Russian territory 

If it’s mostly ideological concerns, I think it is time we are seek shelter 😱
[9/21/22, 12:53:58 AM] Nelson ✨: Ideologies, and the economical part plays an essential role in it.

Putin khuylo was brainwashed since a young age to despice the western world. He worked as an assasin for his own country. He is definitely 🤡 before anything else.
[9/21/22, 12:54:57 AM] Gary Teh: I wonder if the next president is going to be equally 🤡
[9/21/22, 12:55:26 AM] Nelson ✨: A single “tactical” nuclear attack could decompensate the fragile balance we have in the world.
[9/21/22, 12:56:21 AM] Marvin: In the best case his speech an hour ago was just escalatory rhetoric, increase the heat and stakes for the west to supply the Ukraine with heavy weapons, then he’d try to hold the regions he controls now
[9/21/22, 12:57:10 AM] Gary Teh: Actually what resources are there in those two regions? 

Or are they mainly to serve the purpose of buffer states?
[9/21/22, 12:57:14 AM] Marvin: But I hope that he and people in the government love their families and country to some extent, he doesn’t want to go down as the destroyer of Russia
[9/21/22, 12:57:33 AM] Nelson ✨: It’s not security… no one has been attacking them. Russian always posed a threat to everyone else in many ways.

You have to talk with the people who live in neighbouring countries to really grasp this.

Ideology moves him, and that makes him think about all the “security threats”, which makes him need a strong economy to deal with it.
[9/21/22, 12:58:21 AM] Marvin: I don’t think that the regions are very resourceful, except for a big nuclear power plant, I think he’s seeking to build a land connection to Crimea
[9/21/22, 12:58:23 AM] Nelson ✨: It’s part of Ukraine.

Everything else comes second.

"you know nothing, John Snow"
[9/21/22, 1:00:31 AM] Gary Teh: Do you have sources to recommend? 🙂
[9/21/22, 1:00:33 AM] Marvin: I agree, up until recently the sentiment in Germany was from my perspective (not my personal opinion!!!), that Russia wasn’t seen as a friend, but also not as an enemy and just an important energy and economic partner. Many people in Germany said the US military bases aren’t necessary and building up the army isn’t necessary either, bc Russia is no threat. This has completely changed, Russia is seen as the biggest enemy now and Germany has become conscious of its ability to defend itself
[9/21/22, 1:01:01 AM] Nelson ✨: Their families, yes. Their country? Not really…

I would assume they love some old, useless ideologies. If they truly loved their country, their people would have better living standards.

The russians that were sent to Ukraine never saw microwaves, water boilers or washmachines before…
[9/21/22, 1:01:28 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly from the Siberian region?
[9/21/22, 1:02:39 AM] Nelson ✨: Basically everything that is not St. Petersburg, Москва and a few other cities.
[9/21/22, 1:03:08 AM] Nelson ✨: People are so damn poor there
[9/21/22, 1:04:07 AM] Gary Teh: Heading to bed now. Will catch up when I wake up. Need to wake up early to catch the online Brave session that @48606646246 is hosting 

@48606646246 please do share the invite link here. 

Tomorrow’s topic on ownership is definitely a very interesting one 🙂
[9/21/22, 1:04:50 AM] Nelson ✨: I dated a high-middle class girl from Воронеж years ago; and damn! That gave me some perspective
[9/21/22, 1:05:21 AM] Aga - DAOist: To be honest, I don't give my attention to it anymore and not sure if I was watching/reading in Polish or English 🤔 but you know - it is a rabbit hole - you start watching one, go to another and another and you realize you knew nothing and it is better not to waste your time on it anymore 🤣
[9/21/22, 1:05:28 AM] Marvin: Yes, what makes matters worse, they are very dependent on western technologies as well and it took decades and billions to build up the infrastructure to deliver gas to Europe, it’s not like they can flip a switch and it’s all going to India and China now. As much as the sanctions hurt Europe, they will hurt Russia even more in the years to come
[9/21/22, 1:06:16 AM] Aga - DAOist: It is today actually 😅 sure, I will drop the link - we start at 5 pm CEST 🤗
[9/21/22, 1:07:34 AM] Nelson ✨: Better So! I prefer to freeze a couple of months xD - Already ordered 50kg of wood for my fireplace 😂

We can’t turn the heater on till Nov. the German gov. said :)
[9/21/22, 1:08:13 AM] Marvin: I think we should always have a certain degree of skepticism when watching news, but a good measure to me is if journalists are free. In the US, Western Europe, Japan etc. I trust the consensus of the press to a good extent. Of course there are extremist sources like Breitbart as well, but I just tend to ignore those
[9/21/22, 1:10:44 AM] Marvin: I’m luckily moving to the US this November from Germany, but I am not too concerned, yes things got more expensive, it sucks, but I don’t feel like it significantly impacted most peoples’ lives and I don’t think that Germany won’t be able to provide energy or heat either. They are just taking a lot of precautions now
[9/21/22, 1:10:54 AM] Nelson ✨: oh no no, please don't trust the consensus of the press. It's mostly an illusion of extremely big media companies who represent the value of the few.

They give you different media channels with "different" opinions, but you always end up coming to the consensus that they selected.

Here in Germany, companies like Bertelsmann and Axel Springer are in charge of steering the narrative.
[9/21/22, 1:11:48 AM] Aga - DAOist: But... just to be clear, I also read before couple of books on diplomacy, international affairs, the currency wars etc. - from different countries. And well, some people talk about it in Poland too from what they see/saw in Ukraine..
Always it is about keeping some questions, not trusting 100%, I agree. Just the more DIFFERENT perspectives you get, you can sense the bigger picture and in the end you can see how each side is manipulating the narrative. After you just feel it 🤷‍♀️
[9/21/22, 1:11:52 AM] Francois renet: It’s along those lines. Illness related.
[9/21/22, 1:12:21 AM] Nelson ✨: In the US for example, people have the illusion of 2 different sides from the gov. - but the truth behind is that both sides share around 3/4ths of the funding they get.

Even when Sanders was running for president, he had more than half of his campaign funds being paid by the same :)
[9/21/22, 1:12:38 AM] Marvin: There are many other independent sources in Germany and other countries as well, I wouldn’t bet my life on it, but I feel like most of the time they are generally right when it comes to reporting about things that happen. Some put their own ideological spin on it, that’s something we have to ignore
[9/21/22, 1:14:18 AM] Nelson ✨: Yes, most countries have them. The problem is that they don't have as much reach and resonance as the "less-independent" media :/
[9/21/22, 1:14:34 AM] Marvin: Often it’s also for the lack of a better alternative, if I know journalists won’t get arrested writing something and almost all of them report the same thing, that’s satisfactory
[9/21/22, 1:15:20 AM] Marvin: Yeah, that’s why I tend to read American German French British and Japanese news and when something comes up I even watch the Russian side of things
[9/21/22, 1:15:26 AM] Francois renet: I agree with Nelson. Much disinformation happening. From the actual role of the US in the conflict to extreme fake news. Ultimately, all the people that Putin enriched are now losing everything because of sanctions. And they will turn on him. It’s happening as we speak.
[9/21/22, 1:17:13 AM] Jonathan: what about this .. fake news?
[9/21/22, 1:17:14 AM] Jonathan: https://nyadagbladet.se/utrikes/shocking-document-how-the-us-planned-the-war-and-energy-crisis-in-europe/
[9/21/22, 1:18:15 AM] Francois renet: I heard a lot of rumors about that. What is not a rumor is the US needed a battle ground to test new weapons...
[9/21/22, 1:19:58 AM] Marvin: Yes, looks like bs to me.
[9/21/22, 1:20:39 AM] Aga - DAOist: Even independent doesn't mean that they know what is behind the sceens or understand more than specific ares.. I think you need to have a complex understanding of this whole system structure to be able to connect the dots.. which also starts to go out to the public🙏 

Everything is connected.

Not all people are ready for the truth. This need to come step by step.
[9/21/22, 1:21:37 AM] Marvin: They even referred to our minister of economy as minister of the environment
[9/21/22, 1:23:52 AM] Marvin: They just make up bullshit claims, what interest could america possibly have in a weak Germany? In the face of conflict with China, america needs strong and reliable partners in Europe. The Green Party doesn’t have that much power and conceded most of their requests in favor of the coalition being upheld and the majority of Germans supports her in sanctioning Russia and not getting gas from there
[9/21/22, 1:25:55 AM] Francois renet: The frightening part is that whether the article is true or false, the assumptions made in the article are actually based on facts, and the strategy is realistic.  Let's look at some of the statements by Liz Truss, and policy changes to understand that big business is not going to change any time soon
[9/21/22, 1:26:07 AM] Marvin: Germany probably has one of the most checked and reliable electoral systems in the world, nobody placed any politicians here, some of the ones mentioned have been there since the 80s and joined the party out of a college activist group. It just invents a completely different narrative of everything with pseudo justifications
[9/21/22, 1:27:35 AM] Marvin: I understand that america had an interest in breaking Germany’s energy dependency on Russia, but I don’t think anything else holds true. Germany is probably most in line with American values, especially the ones of the Democratic Party, what interest could America have in weakening such an ally
[9/21/22, 1:29:10 AM] Francois renet: With all due respect Marvin, this is a very naive perspective. When looking at America and policies, you are looking at the stage when one really needs to look at behind the scenes and who actually dictates the policy. It sure isn't the governemnt
[9/21/22, 1:29:28 AM] Nelson ✨: I didn’t read the article; but it sounds like it uses the old tactic of mixing both lies and truth. So that people end up believing the lies, by supporting then with undeniable truth 😬😬

I’m watching Nayib Bukele’s speech at the UN now :)
[9/21/22, 1:30:25 AM] Nelson ✨: Maybe I’ll read it later; else I guess it is better to not give an opinion or I become prt of the problem 😅🥲
[9/21/22, 1:32:04 AM] Marvin: Germany is one of the largest employers, investors, and trading partners of the US. It’s a very mutually beneficial relationship, America needs a strong EU as a partner more than ever to withstand economic dominance from China. I stick to what I said, I don’t think it’s naive, even if America was only selfish, even if I believed in a conspiracy, few people in America benefit from a weak Europe and the risks of a war with Russia, especially taking the nuclear stakes into consideration wouldn’t make sense.
[9/21/22, 1:33:36 AM] Francois renet: who knows Marvin, after all without 100% checked facts none of us can understand it all 🙂
[9/21/22, 1:34:41 AM] Marvin: That is true, it can’t be proven or disproven in a mathematical fashion.
[9/21/22, 1:52:18 AM] Kelvin Chew: Russia's partial mobilisation will see 300,000 drafted: Defence minister

[9/21/22, 1:52:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: When u poke the bear 🐻
[9/21/22, 1:53:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russias-putin-announces-partial-military-mobilisation?utm_campaign=stfb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR1bYS6Yp2Z9uncKqsogRMw8rLnvCF28MyKwtu5SyOaoq8iMjamIiPXi4iQ
[9/21/22, 1:54:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: I have to agree. The west is constantly provoking
[9/21/22, 2:02:52 AM] Francois renet: 300K who have no idea what they’re doing and have zero desire to be there. Sadly they will be cannon food. That is the sad part of war. The innocent die as those responsible sit in the comfort of their offices and bunkers.
[9/21/22, 2:02:53 AM] Marvin: By existing and allowing countries to determine their own path? Nobody in their right mind ever thought about attacking Russia
[9/21/22, 2:03:00 AM] Nelson ✨: Kelvin, why would you believe a man that even lies about how many of his soldiers got killed by an order of magnitude? 

He took part of another’s country territory. What do you say the west is provoking?
[9/21/22, 2:04:30 AM] Francois renet: Kelvin is actually correct. The US pushed and pushed and pushed before the war whilst Europe was trying to calm things down.
[9/21/22, 2:05:53 AM] Marvin: Do you think an authoritarian dictator like Putin understands weakness? Didn’t work with Chamberlain and Hitler, won’t work with Putin either
‎[9/21/22, 2:06:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: ‎image omitted
[9/21/22, 2:06:47 AM] Nelson ✨: Far from correct; but not entirely wrong.

It is true that the “west” has provoked them; but the story between Ukraine and Russia is longer than any relationships with the west…
[9/21/22, 2:07:16 AM] Kelvin Chew: Each country probably deserved some bombs
[9/21/22, 2:07:51 AM] Nelson ✨: At the end if anyone asks me, these are the 3 most dangerous countries to the sovereignty of the world:

1. Russia
2. USA
3. China
[9/21/22, 2:08:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: Can u name me one war which China participated in besides that one border dispute with India
[9/21/22, 2:09:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: 900 military bases all over the world. Belongs to usa. China has 32. And yup it’s the most dangerous country
[9/21/22, 2:09:23 AM] Marvin: I’m glad that America picks up messes around the world, to keep us safe, countries like Afghanistan are way worse off now without the US. But remind me when the US attacked a democratic nation with the objective to annex the territory.
[9/21/22, 2:10:17 AM] Kelvin Chew: That’s why I said each country deserved to be bombed
[9/21/22, 2:10:31 AM] Francois renet: that is absolutely correct Nelson. but that is true of the entire Eastern Europe, their history is intimately tied, and full of love and hate. We met a Bulgarian gallery owner in Basel who's face was disfigured as a result of getting beaten up by Ukrainian teenagers when she was a child because she was Bulgarian. At the end of the day it's just fear and misunderstanding, and as I stated earlier the innocent paying the consequences. THAT is what needs to change. forget the political leaders, plant the see of peace between people, that is how we will be agents of change
[9/21/22, 2:10:35 AM] Nelson ✨: A war is not always fought with soldiers; the mini list there is my personal opinion based on the potential.
[9/21/22, 2:11:13 AM] Nelson ✨: I wouldn’t exist if that was the case.
[9/21/22, 2:12:20 AM] Nelson ✨: Attacking by annexing a territory is not the only way have you can mess with a country… 🤷🏻‍♂️
[9/21/22, 2:12:33 AM] Francois renet: Marvin, have you read Economic hitman?
[9/21/22, 2:13:01 AM] Marvin: No I have not
[9/21/22, 2:13:34 AM] Francois renet: please do. you'll find it quite enlightening.
[9/21/22, 2:14:13 AM] Marvin: Does it try to explain how america just fights for oil etc. ?
[9/21/22, 2:14:38 AM] Nelson ✨: Yeah, sadly many Ukrainians were brainwashed during the tomes of the soviet union :( - also there are exceptions everywhere.

I believe that most of the people of the world are naturally good; but it is always a few of them full of anger which end up runing things for all others.
[9/21/22, 2:17:44 AM] Nelson ✨: Anyways; I think the largest countries in the world shouldn’t exist as big as they are. When the rulers of those countries ait and make such impacting decisions, they get corrupted by the power.
[9/21/22, 2:18:08 AM] Nelson ✨: sit*
[9/21/22, 2:18:59 AM] Marvin: Do you think so? I mean we rarely had this much peace in the world in history
[9/21/22, 2:19:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: Except for usa of course. We need the police of the world who decides which country is right or wrong.
[9/21/22, 2:19:03 AM] Nelson ✨: At the end we all want a peaceful world, where can concentrate on the problems that matter. But when we have to be careful of our own neighbours… that makes it challenging.
[9/21/22, 2:19:31 AM] Francois renet: It actually shows how US uses manipulation of groups, in south and Latin America, for their gain...and it shows how far they are willing to go to do it
[9/21/22, 2:19:41 AM] Marvin: In many countries this is decided by corruption and who has the most machine guns and unfortunately not by the suppressed people
[9/21/22, 2:19:53 AM] Kelvin Chew: Not true. We can’t have that. Who will usa sell bombs and planes to then?
[9/21/22, 2:19:57 AM] Nelson ✨: Yes, I do think so for the principles I stated.

Peace by fear of mutual ahnilation is not really peaceful…
[9/21/22, 2:20:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: That’s why we need freedom bombing to kill all of them
[9/21/22, 2:20:48 AM] Nelson ✨: What entitles the US to be the “police of the world”? The country cannot even rule their own territory properly.
[9/21/22, 2:21:06 AM] Kelvin Chew: No idea. Seems that way. Usa decides for the world.
[9/21/22, 2:21:49 AM] Nelson ✨: Kelvin, I’m trying to have a constructive conversation :)
[9/21/22, 2:21:51 AM] Marvin: I think we shouldn’t get involved militarily with those countries anymore, unless they pose a very immediate threat, things like Iraq were a huge mistake.
[9/21/22, 2:22:19 AM] Nelson ✨: And it shouldn’t be so, please watch the UN speech from Nayib Bukele from yesterday :)
[9/21/22, 2:22:33 AM] Marvin: But we should also let the relationships and cooperations to countries like Saudi Arabia fade out
[9/21/22, 2:22:45 AM] Kelvin Chew: I am just being supportive to a one sided view.
[9/21/22, 2:23:14 AM] Kelvin Chew: Because China must be wrong. And Russia must be wrong. Usa can’t make mistakes
[9/21/22, 2:23:24 AM] Nelson ✨: What about trying to see things from the different perspectives?
[9/21/22, 2:23:33 AM] Kelvin Chew: I would ask the same of u
[9/21/22, 2:23:40 AM] Marvin: It’s not just the US, I think the majority of people in Western Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, Canada and so forth agree that freedom is worth fighting for
[9/21/22, 2:23:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: U know how many people are suffering in Taiwan
[9/21/22, 2:23:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: From that one pelosi visit
[9/21/22, 2:24:02 AM] Kelvin Chew: U know European Geo politics
[9/21/22, 2:24:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: Now let me educate u on asean politics
[9/21/22, 2:24:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: That one visit caused so much hardship
[9/21/22, 2:24:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: On Taiwan
[9/21/22, 2:24:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t claim to know better
[9/21/22, 2:24:54 AM] Kelvin Chew: Let the Asian me tell u
[9/21/22, 2:24:59 AM] Nelson ✨: I lived in some of the countries we have been talking too; and have family in all of them.

This is how I gather a more hollistic perspective.

Been in the US 50+ times before. Have family there and enjoyed the country.
[9/21/22, 2:25:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: Good
[9/21/22, 2:25:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: So I will defer to u when u say u know the west more
[9/21/22, 2:25:26 AM] Nelson ✨: Totally!
[9/21/22, 2:25:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: So be open when I tell u about Taiwan
[9/21/22, 2:25:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just as I defer to u for knowledge on the west
[9/21/22, 2:25:46 AM] Marvin: The majority of people in Taiwan are still in favor of that visit, yes it has an impact on Taiwan, but not everybody sells out for some trade, people have ideals, people want to live in freedom, people want to determine their own faith
[9/21/22, 2:25:56 AM] Kelvin Chew: Where r u from?
[9/21/22, 2:26:07 AM] Nelson ✨: I guess marvin is from DACH?
[9/21/22, 2:26:10 AM] Marvin: Germany, moving to the US soon and I lived in Japan for a while
[9/21/22, 2:26:12 AM] Nelson ✨: Germany, maybe?
[9/21/22, 2:26:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: Oh wow. U know Taiwan more when I actually have relatives there
[9/21/22, 2:26:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: And I am actually Asian
[9/21/22, 2:26:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: Ok.
[9/21/22, 2:26:51 AM] Nelson ✨: Bro, chill. We are having a discussion here :)
[9/21/22, 2:26:55 AM] Kelvin Chew: I rest my case
[9/21/22, 2:26:56 AM] Marvin: My husband is Chinese so I am somewhat familiar with the culture, his ancestors are Taiwanese and Cantonese
[9/21/22, 2:27:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: Ok. U go ahead
[9/21/22, 2:27:16 AM] Kelvin Chew: The west knows best
[9/21/22, 2:27:26 AM] Nelson ✨: Not need to get defensive
[9/21/22, 2:27:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: I am disengaging in this particular conversation
[9/21/22, 2:27:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Peace out
[9/21/22, 2:27:44 AM] Marvin: I’m not saying I know best, but please refer to the polls in Taiwan, I would be in favor of letting the people vote over an accession to China
[9/21/22, 2:28:01 AM] Marvin: If they want it, it’s not our business
[9/21/22, 2:28:57 AM] Marvin: It’s not about us knowing best, it’s about peoples’ ability to determine their own faith and not being suppressed by countries like China or Russia
[9/21/22, 2:29:15 AM] Nelson ✨: If you read before; I put all of the 3 countries in the most dangerous to the world sovereignty list.

If you read my comments, you could easily assume that I don’t support the US.
[9/21/22, 2:30:35 AM] Marvin: And I don’t get the historic arguments, if we’d start looking at who owned what in the past, we’d never have peace. Once and for all we need to accept the status quo
[9/21/22, 2:32:53 AM] Nelson ✨: At the end we all should be able to criticize what our own nations do wrong. Taking a stand from a one-sided perspective is what starts all these problems :(
[9/21/22, 2:33:23 AM] Francois renet: historic arguments have value. Look at the ultra nationalist narrative that is emerging across Europe as a result of the last immigration waves. In France, Germany. Italy. the root cause is fear. mostly fear about employment, food, shelter and energy. fear and survival instinct rarely ends well
[9/21/22, 2:34:18 AM] Marvin: I’m not saying we shouldn’t learn from history, I’m saying Germany shouldn’t ask Poland to give East Prussia back
[9/21/22, 2:35:06 AM] Francois renet: none of these conversations would be necessary if we understood the notion of one world
[9/21/22, 2:47:31 AM] Nelson ✨: Citizens of planet earth
[9/21/22, 2:49:59 AM] Nelson ✨: I have only waived Ukraine's flag in the past 10 years because they need my support. Except when watching soccer, there I have waived El Salvador's and Germany's 😅 - mostly to spend time with my dad who is a soccer fan.

My point is, if I were to waive one flag for one "nation" I support, that would be this flag:

[9/21/22, 3:15:16 AM] Francois renet: So this is a flag you designed Nelson?
[9/21/22, 3:16:35 AM] Nelson ✨: No way hahaha, I wish I could, but this is a project by Oskar Pernefeldt
[9/21/22, 4:02:32 AM] Francois renet: Very nice!

[9/21/22, 11:11:40 AM] Gary Teh: Seems like there has been a really lively discussion about what Putin would do next. 

As what @48606646246 mentioned there is probably more than meets the eye. 

From my perspective the value of having this discussion we just had is not about having everyone come to a consensus on what the situation is. The real value is in surfacing more data points in the space by people in different geographical location that others might not has access to. That way participants of this discussion can then walk away with more data points to come to their private conclusions. Private conclusions they can utilize for decision making in their own personal lives.  

This two conflicting data points surfacing during the discussion is noteworthy 

1. Putin is mobilizing more troops 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-21/putin-announces-partial-mobilization-stepping-up-ukraine-war

2. Putin expresses intention to de escalate the situation 
https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/625180
[9/21/22, 11:12:54 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful!! I am on my way south now. Hopefully by the time I get to Oregon, we can do some foraging 🙂
[9/21/22, 11:15:59 AM] Gary Teh: Just to give a sense, from my perspective if oil price remains severely elevated this winter, I will probably be less inclined to head into Europe during this period and add to the energy load of the infrastructure in that region and be more inclined head down to the desert region of the Mojave desert
[9/21/22, 11:39:00 AM] Gary Teh: One key insight I gained about camping in Alaska during the borderline winter period is that almost all state campgrounds end up free of charge by default. 

The main reason is because no one is really extreme enough to volunteer as camp host and be sleeping in an “igloo” every night just to enforce some arbitrary human rules (collect payment)

But if you are crazy enough to want to camp in an “igloo” every night by all means go ahead. 🤣
[9/21/22, 1:50:20 PM] Francois renet: As per my earlier point https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-blinken-calls-moscows-referendum-attempts-a-sham-zelenskiy-to-speak-at-un

https://maps.me/

I think layered in the Web3 aspects much later on. I was using it when I was traveling through Africa and right now I am purely relying on it in Alaska 

Google map has failed me once again 🤣
[9/24/22, 4:22:54 PM] Gary Teh: The way they layered the Web3 into their user experience was really thoughtful. They really understood their user’s journey in the real world
[9/24/22, 11:51:24 PM] Aga - DAOist: I think there are a few books and courses. And higher levels also require to participate irl so you learn how to measure each place and apply the biogeometry.
[9/25/22, 10:53:03 AM] Gary Teh: Would be glad if you could share them here too
[9/25/22, 12:27:39 PM] Aga - DAOist: https://www.biogeometry.ca/research
[9/25/22, 12:28:01 PM] Aga - DAOist: On this website you have also courses available
[9/25/22, 12:29:41 PM] Aga - DAOist: The first 2 books here: https://www.amazon.com/Books-Ibrahim-Karim/s?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AIbrahim+Karim

[9/26/22, 12:25:05 AM] Aga - DAOist: The new law they just want to sign in Poland would allow a district governer to announce anytime when "the conditions are not beneficial" (no matter which conditions so could be another pandemic, weather or possible war) some special period under which they can take over your property for whatever is 'needed' and e.g. bring other people to your property... without any compensation..
Totalitarism under cover..

Not yet signed. But they want it to come into force on the 1st January 2023.. Please have a look in other countries what laws are implemented. When everybody talks about some other stuff they proceed with new laws limiting our rights and taking over our assets.
[9/26/22, 12:26:38 AM] Aga - DAOist: Btw I also heard about some other stupid law that exists apparently in Spain (my friend who lives there told me some time ago). If you are more than 48h away from your apartment and someone decides to live there (probably by breaking in) then when you are back you can't kick them out. And you are still an owner who has to pay the bills 😅 @18058259365 maybe you know more about it 😅
[9/26/22, 12:28:33 AM] Nelson ✨: Damn, that’s sad and scary!
I hope people go out and oppose it.

I haven’t read it yet, but from what you say it sounds too generic.
Many countries have such laws but they protect certain things like your primary house or your first 250K$ or something
[9/26/22, 12:29:37 AM] Nelson ✨: Yep, Spain is infamous for having such problems 🤡😅
[9/26/22, 12:34:17 AM] Aga - DAOist: Yeah.. we have some people who catch this things and analyze immidiately. However apparently the opposition was quiet, media too. I suppose this is also a clear sign that they are all on one side really..
[9/26/22, 12:36:44 AM] Nelson ✨: Might very well be, it benefits them too whenever they get in power. Or, they are still analyzing everything and preparing how to respond to it, maybe use it a s a hige marketing stunt against the current gov.
[9/26/22, 12:38:43 AM] Aga - DAOist: Yeah.. but tbh this doesn't seem like a "capitalistic" country at all.. some of the western countries are already deeply in some other forms of organization.. and in illusion of having freedom.. 

I have Spanish friends who are unfortunately very much blinded.. I think emotions play a big role there - the more emotional nation, the easier that is to manipulate the narrative and distruct.
[9/26/22, 12:39:05 AM] Johnson Teh: 😂 this is why I love Singapore 🇸🇬 

Sg is the last few untouched ground on Earth where most rich and poor ppl are emotionally rational and intellectually honest to know that as an individually we don’t know any better than a government formed by the Smartest, richest and selfless to manage a common resources… 😂
[9/26/22, 12:44:02 AM] Aga - DAOist: In Poland the opposition is actually cooperating with globalists so it is what they want to do too..

Poland is a weird country in terms of parties 😅 the ruling party doesn't seem to be connected with the globalists (at least not that much) however they are strongly bonded with the church but sort of creating another branch (they also argue a lot with Vatican)..

I suppose that is also a reason why Poland is not well presented on any international media.. 🤔
[9/26/22, 1:20:17 AM] Gary Teh: They fulfilled their purpose  o laying their eggs and died of old age 🤔
[9/26/22, 1:21:35 AM] Francois renet: many of them? at the same time?
[9/26/22, 1:25:27 AM] Johnson Teh: I don’t have sufficient polish Ex-Gf to qualify my view, but given polish one of the oldest language and how the whole nation speaks it, it must have a exclusivity DNA that shield of from the outside context world (aka globalisation now)….
[9/26/22, 1:29:21 AM] Gary Teh: One after another I guess
[9/26/22, 1:30:57 AM] Johnson Teh: One simply cannot be both a specialist and a  generalist,

since polish opt to shut it door, 
they must be pretty contented in fulfilling its people’s needs than to follow a global quest to unify them w the rest of the world. 

Such is the why EU as an experiment is destined to fail, We just need to be realist and manage it along the way

[9/26/22, 2:28:52 PM] Iris - Community Manager: Just curious, how old Polish language is?
[9/27/22, 12:12:29 AM] Marvin: I don’t think it is destined to fail, especially the war brought NATO and the EU closer together than ever. Countries have different identities, but in Europe they are united by sharing mostly the same values. Poland always had a very strong majority in favor of remaining in the EU: https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/06/22/spotlight-on-poland-negative-views-of-russia-surge-but-ratings-for-u-s-nato-eu-improve/ many polls confirmed this during the past years
[9/27/22, 2:29:24 AM] Francois renet: But then the far right in Italy wins the election!
[9/27/22, 3:01:06 AM] Aga - DAOist: What is important is the complexity of our language. It is one of the most difficult ones in the world - some say that even 2nd most difficult one. And using it also helps brain apparently to analyze more 🤷‍♀️

However,
Let's don't forget that those globalists are very smart and they create traps also for those who wake up from some illusion. This way you feel like you already understand, you are better than others (ego comes in) and don't ever realize when you got into another delusion...

Same here with Polish (and any other nation!). I guess this whole war was also to bring Polish people back to EU, especially the goverment..

And I am not sure how deep you are guys into the rabbit hole but I am convinced that all the negative structures will collapse. And this includes all the EU institutions which under these "values" are also brainwashing people and set them in fact against each other..

One thing to remember - none of the parties is fine. They all play in fact the same game like in theather of different roles against us.. and people just follow..
[9/27/22, 3:28:35 AM] Iris - Community Manager: Interesting, for me some Asian languages are far more difficult to grasp, along with Hebrew and Arabic (especially when it comes to pronunciation). Among European ones, definitely Scandinavian languages, particularly Finnish.
[9/27/22, 3:29:51 AM] Iris - Community Manager: Guess it all depends where people are from and what is their innate ability to learn new languages.
[9/27/22, 5:54:17 AM] Aga - DAOist: They seem difficult but the research was considering also grammar structures. So in Polish we declinate a lot - nouns have 3 genders, every verb or adjective will be declinated and there are on top 7 cases... this makes our language very complex..
[9/27/22, 5:54:56 AM] Aga - DAOist: And yes, I think Finnish or Hungarian were considered as the most difficult ones
[9/27/22, 1:00:14 PM] Gary Teh: Seems some covert activities are happening right now to severely escalate tension in the Russian war. The nord stream pipeline was rumored to have been  “sabotaged”

[9/27/22, 1:07:50 PM] Francois renet: But wasn’t that done to force a shut down of NS1 to
Open NS2?
[9/27/22, 1:08:45 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps 🤔
[9/27/22, 1:09:08 PM] Gary Teh: Who would best gain from this disruption?
[9/27/22, 1:11:23 PM] Francois renet: Not sure. All I know is lots of Russian oil is still flowing west. It just travels through different ports.
[9/27/22, 1:17:36 PM] Gary Teh: Been reading up on global supply chain route. Seems a huge portion of oil from Western Africa gets imported into western Europe as well

[9/27/22, 9:11:07 PM] Gary Teh: Helps explains why a lot of the middle eastern oil countries are diversifying their revenue stream away from oil since US no longer an importer 

Also explains alot why US has been steadily abandoning the world order it created via the Bretonwood system. 

Also gives perspective on the Russian invasion into Ukraine.  It’s argued it’s end goal is to secure its borders via natural geographical barriers on the western front before its forces grows to old to fight in the forthcoming new world order (which is going to be mainly a bunch of local hegemonies)
‎[9/27/22, 9:11:26 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/27/22, 9:14:20 PM] Gary Teh: Seems in the mid to long run though, due to aging an a lack of reproduction in Russia, the territory will be mainly ran by largely ethnic minorities. So Russian oil supply in the mid to long run will not be available for export as that area descends into infighting. It will be much like what it was like after the collapse of the Mongolian empire and the disruption of the first Silk Road
[9/27/22, 9:18:47 PM] Gary Teh: I think the really fascinating portion is the period after the forthcoming population collapse (due to worldwide aging population)

The social impact will be very much similar to when the blank death removed around 2/3 of the European population 

The labor shortage and constrains during that period triggered off the renaissances period as the surviving population seeks to figure out how to get around that constrain
[9/27/22, 10:34:39 PM] Gary Teh: Seems after US abandons the current world order in place, countries like Singapore which relies on a stable more or less predictable international environment for its import export trades will get really badly impacted. Much like the 2 straight years of negative gdp since COViD
[9/27/22, 11:13:29 PM] Francois renet: Interesting. I was talking to some friends in Singapore and they are saying that with HK slowdown much international business has been flowing to Singapore.
[9/27/22, 11:19:33 PM] Gary Teh: True. The finance is redirecting. However overall is still down
[9/27/22, 11:22:37 PM] Francois renet: Could it be a slight mistrust in the government of Singapore? My father had a company there for several years and it was difficult with the extreme oversight from the government.
[9/27/22, 11:46:41 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. It basically just low shipping volume because overall world trade volume is down

[9/28/22, 9:22:03 AM] Johnson Teh: (1) Geographically Sg is a Entrepôt, as such location thrives in time of uncertainty, so don't believe the layman talk of how sg will die in time of tension, in fact it is over such period that Sg can bargain w the super powers and play a significant role

(2) Sg with its Asian Dragon & Tigers have been on the declining since China managed to woos USA in mid 90s, 
Sg is the only dragon that can pivot its economy to continue its path of prosperity, but with the decoupling of USA and China, South East Asia will have a second chance to regain some old trade.
 
(3) So rather than being pessimistic, Sg shld be doing very very well in next 5~8 yrs, until power of Xi in China and Trump in USA die off, until then Sg will be hot, esp its finance and Property segment. 

(4) Of cos, as like any big and complex family, there will be segment that is being left behind. The weakest link in Sg is its own ppl, collectively, Sg has one of the poorest gene pool in Asia, it has collected the lowest ranking gene, as most early immigrants were low end labour, cheapskate merchant and convicts, hence it really have a bad head start when compared to its Asia counterparts. Sg saving grace is that it inherited the pragmatic English system from its British master, sadly this nature is declining the decades of good life weakens its local gene pool back to its original form....

(5) So Sg will collapsed from within during good time and not from external over tough time

as it is in one of the most populated region (Asia), 
all Sg needs is to loosen its "gate"

Rather its weak gene pool is it what that stop the govt from importing more human into Sg...
Sadly most Sg ppl are unable to keep up the fight in the long run, 
hopefully its new immigrants will have better vision and Stamina for sg

I am really glad I am right now not camping at that same spot I did along Caroline beach back during the pandemic 

I remembered abandoning camp one evening when I woke up at night to see the ankle deep rain water by my car. 

I ended up evacuating out of South Carolina state into Charlotte, North Carolina in the middle of the night. I guess it’s easy when my house is literally on 4 wheels. Not so lucky for those folks who are living on landed property.
[9/30/22, 8:47:45 PM] Gary Teh: This is a very interesting share about how the Great resignation is funneling into the migration to DAO trend I am observing 

https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2022/09/22/toss-in-your-job-and-make-300k-working-for-a-dao-heres-how

Already the past few weeks I have quite a few of my former engineering colleagues from Bay Area reaching out to ask about how my setup is regarding physical address, license plate and stuff as more and more of them leave their full time positions for god knows where in the web3 space 🤣
[9/30/22, 9:01:44 PM] TUSHAR SHARMA: In India, Web 3 hype is so much... non techs even CA's , mechanical engineers hv started learning Blockchain, and leaving everything aside, don't know where they all will fit in... 

On the other hand, existing Blockchain development company owners msg almost every week... Tht they hv a threat to survival no projects in the space... 

God knows whats happening
[9/30/22, 9:09:52 PM] TUSHAR SHARMA: Interesting article indeed
[9/30/22, 9:10:06 PM] Gary Teh: 🤣

I see it as basically not enough people doing the actual work of bringing blockchain to the market... 

By that, I mean doing the actual business development where marketeers reach out to existing companies, identifying use cases that blockchain could be applied on, then implementing and deploying those solutions.

Right now, what I am observing is there is a lot of activity focused on developing the technology itself (engineering), sharing and discussing about what the technology is (content creation), maybe writing and sharing ideas about how it could be applied but very little focus on the go to market aspects. 

The go to market is actually the hard part, mainly because its like running a typical enterprise sales process where you do a lot of outreach and end up with a lot of rejections. And based on my observation 95% of the population entering into the Web3 don't really belong to the sales (marketing) profile. 🤔
[9/30/22, 9:11:25 PM] Gary Teh: Or even if they do feel inclined, they haven't the critical of professional relationships to draw from.

Technically the next time similar patterns occur again, we could pulled out historical trends to quickly identify where the correlations are as well as the cause and effect chain.
[9/30/22, 9:54:13 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of which, would be great if we all share news sources we are actively monitoring ourselves privately. That way I could add them to the engine to further augment our news feed and sentiment analysis data.
[9/30/22, 9:56:50 PM] Gary Teh: I think the main difference between this platform and the facebook / linkedin platform is that your sharing on Facebook and LinkedIn does not yield you ownership in them.

Yes! Let’s chat next Tuesday 🙂

[10/1/22, 2:33:35 PM] Gary Teh: However on the flip side after observing the economics of decentralized models, what is counter-intuitive is that operating overheads are kept to a minimal if not none-existent 

The primary reason is because in traditional web2.0 social networks, the bulk of the operating expenses are in fact labor costs. 

The executive team finances this by raising cash from VCs. 

In the DAO based approach, the members are the users, are the investors and the builders. 

So technically even if a DAO runs out of cash and most members stop being active, so long as within its network of members there exist even one zealot, the DAO will still persist. 

In that regard, a DAO operates more like a cult (soon to be religion) than a traditional startup. When you look back in history, Christianity started out as a cult and kept on growing stronger not despite of but because of the continued persecution by the Romans during the period of the Black Death.

[10/1/22, 2:51:09 PM] Gary Teh: Hmmm… just occurred to me the similarity between these two scenarios I just described 

Black Death and the Rise of Christianity 

Pandemic and the rise of DAOs 
🤔
[10/1/22, 3:59:29 PM] Francois renet: But DAO = decentralized where as Christianity = organized religion for the masses.
[10/1/22, 4:16:47 PM] Gary Teh: True as well. 🤔

Here are some of the similarities I observe between these two group types 

- worldview grounded in some form of abstraction to help members make sense of the generally unpredictable environment 

- based on my observation at least of the way Christian churches operate in Asia, each church seems to function independently though they interpret from the same source (the bible) 

I observe within my limited sample size the Roman Catholic Church operates very different from the Christian church as they are very centralized and top down with the pope at the top of the hierarchy
[10/1/22, 4:25:22 PM] Francois renet: all good observations @14153000019 ! However, my humble opinion, all are very structurally organized, and foster mostly, from what i have seen, a very homogenous type of following (somewhat indoctrinated)  with little room for individuality. I went to sunday school when i was in my late 30s and had to stop as interpretation was not encouraged, and any question was answered with "you just have to believe" "you just have to have faith". any deviation from the learnings was dismissed.
[10/1/22, 4:28:12 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! I defer to you on this part. You are the expert 🙂
[10/1/22, 4:30:42 PM] Francois renet: not at all @14153000019 . Just sharing my experience in Europe and the US. I like the "look under any rock, or under any branch, and you will find me there". I subscribe to the idea of a God that is omnipresent, over a God who resides in churches, or other places of worship only.
[10/1/22, 4:36:45 PM] Aga - DAOist: It reminds me now how they actually introduced the concept of us being everyone we project in our reality 🤔
[10/1/22, 4:39:40 PM] Aga - DAOist: And regarding churches - I believe that in every strudcure there is sth to get inspired from but in order to make it good for the humanity this time we should look differently too.. realize how people change now and this requires some adaptations that were maybe not even tried yet. Consistence and patience. It won't happen from one day to another either.
[10/1/22, 4:41:58 PM] Gary Teh: Agree! 🙂

When I abstract the general pattern from all the documentations I had the opportunity to get my hands on, the common denominators are Time and Consciousness (which is necessary to perceive that Time exist). 

Technically in the dimension of Time, Time is omnipresent 

And from the perspective of Consciousness, it’s just everywhere as well. 

A sentient being can’t really escape from either Time or Consciousness. Since that is the very core of its nature.
[10/1/22, 4:45:09 PM] Gary Teh: Suppose there is a dimension where consciousness doesn’t exist, then that dimension might as well not exist since there is no observer there to validate its existence and it is irrelevant 

Suppose there is a dimension where time don’t exist. It is impossible too for consciousness to observe its existence since you need Time to flow to be able to observe anything 🤣
[10/1/22, 4:51:14 PM] Aga - DAOist: The first Law says "All is mental" therefore I feel that there is no way for anything to exist (like a dimension) without some consciousness projecting it 🤔

As for Time part, I believe that we have a different perception of it, as you said because of our consciousness which is not yet that developed 😅 all in in the Now according to quantum 💫
[10/1/22, 5:23:14 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: I'm connected! @whelmness.ETH & solana 🙂
[10/1/22, 5:28:30 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: There is a third Jesus that doesn't get much mass attention, but is certainly drawn upon heavily in the crypto scene. In the early days of bitcoin, i saw a LOT of memes representing Jesus being an advocate for crypto ... the premise being that the "degen Christians" respond to the "rebel Christ" -- the sovereign vessel of God, not accountable to Church (the old testament) or state (Rome)
[10/1/22, 5:29:57 PM] Johnson Teh: We think so because we think so...

Are we thinking that....
 for Time to exist there must be an observer....
 for observer to exist there must be a consciousness....
 for consciousness to exist there must be a flow....

What if..... 
consciousness does exits in an emptiness, 
thus stillness is another form of flow?

Can an observer be deeded exists when the consciousness had stop?
Much Like sleeping or in a coma?
If so, perhaps ....
emptiness is just another "thing" that is projected by consciousness that is not in flow

[10/1/22, 11:33:36 PM] Gary Teh: I keep imagining it to be something that members in Offchain global will use when they attend in real life events
[10/1/22, 11:34:33 PM] Youna Kim: No war. No wall. No Barriers?
[10/1/22, 11:35:59 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah no barrier. Then @8618926086648 and @14152032783 could just go figure which members attended which off chain events the next time and then airdrop regular attendees with very specific NFTs which automatically grant them access for specific upcoming events.
[10/1/22, 11:36:13 PM] Johnson Teh: 😂 u sure??

I doubt the north will share this sentiment, not when they 100X better prep to takeover the Southern, they done it once and I am confident they do do it again
‎[10/1/22, 11:36:42 PM] Youna Kim: ‎video omitted
[10/1/22, 11:37:00 PM] Johnson Teh: Good use case but where is the recurrent revenue??
[10/1/22, 11:37:50 PM] Gary Teh: In the case of the metro, the NFTs come with expiry date. So commuters will need to buy new ones every month. 🤣
‎[10/1/22, 11:39:29 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/1/22, 11:43:06 PM] Johnson Teh: These are legal use case issue not tech… USA have too many smart crooks with too little deterrence in its system, which is why they need to stick to so.

In most Asian developed countries there is no such concern. But tech wise SCash is doing an E-KYC proj for a few Govt in Asia now
[10/1/22, 11:44:59 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: A similar use case could be applied in Metaverse.

Imagine you are inside a mall (VR environment) in a metaverse and attending an event.

One should be able to mint a NFT using that specific timestamp
[10/1/22, 11:46:09 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure the local government will eventually want to upgrade their infrastructure and call for RFPs. But that will have to wait till NFTs and wallets really gain widespread adoption and until there is real benefit for the upgrade.
[10/1/22, 11:49:31 PM] Gary Teh: I am actually having reservations about building Metaverses as something I would double down on. 

Two reasons:

1. unless you have alot of cash, it is really hard to win the arms race against the big three. Facebook, Unreal Engine and Robolox. That game is over over

2. I doubt we will be able to break the upper bound hardware limit of having more than 250 concurrent visitors in the same virtual space at the same time. And also no reason to conceptualize it like a traditional mall.
[10/1/22, 11:49:38 PM] Johnson Teh: Unlikely, if so how do the local Govt squeeze money out of normal ppl??? 

We need to think like the American not sg when we are looking at USA use case, esp in the red states
[10/1/22, 11:52:18 PM] Johnson Teh: Of cos unless u can sell this pitch and get lots of investors money 💰 
Then it is worth it. 

Then it is not the NFT that matters but the fund raising, Much likes most gals dressing the way they dress on TV, most norm human won’t make up till so pretty unless can be paid for
[10/1/22, 11:52:26 PM] Gary Teh: No reason. Therefore keep waiting. 🤣
[10/1/22, 11:52:45 PM] Gary Teh: I would believe the innovation will probably happen in the private sector first
‎[10/1/22, 11:52:48 PM] Johnson Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/1/22, 11:53:57 PM] Gary Teh: You just end up waiting your time and other people's money. 🤔
[10/1/22, 11:55:20 PM] Johnson Teh: 😂 ya, this is why I switch to Hotel to make money instead of solving the “housing crisis” in CA. 

Approval for hotel is immediately! 
Check out my new hotel design, I am going to get the made in China screen for 150K and fly the 🇨🇳 fly on 1st Oct yearly (if my Chinese investors pay me  300K upfront for 10Yrs rights) haaa
[10/1/22, 11:57:21 PM] Johnson Teh: Wasting or waiting ???

Anyway there is no such concept as wasting time… we all die and use up 86400 secs daily… either doing something or something else, so no such concept as wasting time as long as u r having fun and making money
[10/1/22, 11:57:50 PM] Gary Teh: Typo. Wasting.

Just spend that time doing something else that matters more.

[10/2/22, 12:02:04 AM] Johnson Teh: Ya lah if can make money then is not a waste of time 

So you now see the magic of capitalism?? Making money is never a waste of one’s time (life)
[10/2/22, 12:03:03 AM] Johnson Teh: Yap I can hire u to fish, cook and eat this guy for me. While I sell a good for nothing NFT 🤑
[10/2/22, 12:03:10 AM] Gary Teh: I think the definition needs to be broader than just making money. So long as it feels meaningful or good 爽🤣
[10/2/22, 12:09:59 AM] Johnson Teh: Pointless to read too deep into it… 

Money is just an universal token to buy “condition” that our senses can derive happiness….

bless are these who can self-happy without external conditions, it is a rare talent (disease)
[10/2/22, 12:14:21 AM] Gary Teh: Bulk of my recent “happy” has been quite free of charge. I must be quite sick 🤣

[10/2/22, 10:10:10 AM] Gary Teh: This game is really 3 different games baked into one game 

Mode 1 - exploring
—— 
You sail around unexplored territories as a cartographer and exchange maps you chartered to a geographical society into exchange for funds to explore more territories 

Mode 2 - trading 
——
You trade goods between ports to generate profit that funds you to sail further, discover more ports with exotic goods and reinvest these profits into these newly discovered ports to build them up. It has the effect of unlocking more exotic goods as well as making larger sail boats available for purchase which allows you to trade even more 

Mode 3 - privateering 
——
You raid merchant boats passing through trade routes and sell off their cargo for profits. You take these profits to buy bigger guns, larger boats and hire more men to raid more merchant boats

[10/2/22, 10:23:18 AM] Gary Teh: I have been figuratively playing Mode 1 in real life over the past 4 years by overlanding across all continents unearthing new trends and generating funds by exploiting one information arbitrage opportunity or another with the use of Edgar the AI.

Now that the Arctic is out of the way, once I am done with Antarctica (hopefully by this forthcoming winter), personally Mode 1 is generally over for me. 🤔

Mode 2 is starting to become interesting. And this personally is what the EcoVerse21 project that got spun off is about 

We are right now figuring out actual sea trading routes and identifying trading partners located at various ports to link up the trading routes originating out of Africa. Part of the trade surpluses will be redirected back to African communities to build them up. I personally feel this might be more sustainable than relying on the on and off donations from the west or loans from the Belt Road intiative from China. Both of these come with so much strings attached 🤔

With that said please welcome @971561302188 who is right now based in Nigeria and is helping with our sourcing needs there 🙂

[10/3/22, 6:41:30 PM] Johnson Teh: Dude gifting is not an economy …. 😂 

Economy is the exchange of production and consumption of human activities…. 

Which is why population is the key to economic growth

Most of all, 
Gift doesn’t create economy,
But gift surely grease everyone mood for each other 🤑
[10/3/22, 6:43:15 PM] Gary Teh: Actually makes sense. Mother Nature and I just consume 🤣
[10/3/22, 6:43:25 PM] Johnson Teh: Having a tokenised gift DAO can be an economy, so maybe u shld offer a pay it forward token 🙂
[10/3/22, 6:43:56 PM] Gary Teh: Uh… I think you are holding that token already 🤔🤣
[10/3/22, 6:47:51 PM] Johnson Teh: All due respect, there is no such thing as Mother Nature…. This is the weirdest concept that American have created after having too good a life and whiskey over too long a period. 

Mom don’t kill, but nature does 
Reckon nature don’t really care if we consume or not, rather we are just part of the many vessel that host the trillion of microorganisms within the mega nature vessel called earth. 

All vessels just consume each other in an endless cycle, for the purpose of converting energy from pen form to another.
[10/3/22, 6:47:58 PM] Gary Teh: And yet another person who suggest I should write a book (or something)… he is the second person in two days… seems to be getting a lot of this request recently and more and more frequently 🤔
[10/3/22, 6:48:04 PM] Johnson Teh: Yes I do 🤑
[10/3/22, 6:49:15 PM] Johnson Teh: Yes u shld go write one! 
We will be proud of you and I will be the first to buy 100 copies to give as gifts to show how we can all be same same but different
[10/3/22, 6:52:34 PM] Gary Teh: Uh… you know a book about a person burning a whole bunch of cash just to move from place to place is not really an inspiring read. 

Coke to think of it @919210068790 was suggesting a book project. So that is three people during the past week? 

@48606646246 being the first. 

My sense is usually when @48606646246 surfaces a theme it magically gains momentum 

Maybe we should collectively write a book about how we pay it forward to society using a DAO. 🤔
[10/3/22, 7:00:23 PM] Johnson Teh: A writer never really write an Inspiring message, it is the reader who felt inspired…. 

You just need to write in a way that is entertaining and easy to read, not so much for others to be inspired, but for them to know that such lifestyle is achievable.

So go write it and share it

Seems once we figured out how the pay it forward / warm introductions dynamic should work, the entire subsystem will be rolled into the cosmic internet initiative. 

My sense is that Hans Martin would like to roll this out amongst the folks helping out with the House of Balance at WEF 

Feels like things are really starting to converge 🙂

You are free, You are Free, YOU ARE Freeeeeeeee

[10/6/22, 2:34:50 AM] Aga - DAOist: I see that John Snow is now our favourite quote 🥳 this made me laugh like crazy on the train station 🤣🤣🤣
[10/6/22, 2:35:49 AM] Aga - DAOist: That is so exciting that you are going to meet guys @14153000019 and @17755088150 😍 we are getting soon to the point when we all meet 💫🥰

[10/7/22, 12:18:13 AM] Gary Teh: Seems there is also a yearly festival where all the nomads gather in the desert of Quartzsite Arizona that happens around the same time WEF is happening in Davos. 

They call it the rubber tramp rendezvous 

https://go-van.com/first-time-rubber-tramp-rendezvous/

Reading through it, this festival does feel way more “Out There” than burning man 🤔🤣
[10/7/22, 12:20:37 AM] Gary Teh: There is another festival a tramp I bumped into told me about when I was in Portugal called the rainbow gathering 

 https://coloradosun.com/2022/07/06/rainbow-family-gathering-2022-colorado/

Seems “welcome home” is also a common theme in this one
[10/7/22, 12:22:26 AM] Gary Teh: @17206665895 have you ever gone to this one?
[10/7/22, 6:28:11 AM] Sarah H.: Rainbow gatherings… be sure to take your own food and water and keep your witts about you
[10/7/22, 7:55:31 AM] Gary Teh: OPEC has recently reduced output of oil in a bid to keep up the price of oil. $USO has been on an uptrend the past four days. What’s does your indicator say about it next week? 

Its Bullish

[10/7/22, 10:08:26 AM] Gary Teh: I was just wondering the other day how privateering mode would look like. I guess the answer has presented itself. 🤔

If the impersonator does not take down that content, we will launch our nukes midnight this evening on that domain. I hope they love paying for AWS server costs 🤣

[10/7/22, 10:13:54 AM] Gary Teh: Right now Solana. 

Here is how we go to war. For folks that are keen to participate 

https://www.petefreitag.com/item/689.cfm

Download Apache bench and configure it to point to that domain

We launch at midnight. 

I will probably spin up a few servers with Apache bench installed and leave them running 🤣
[10/7/22, 10:14:51 AM] Gary Teh: For folks who participate in this midnight session please send me your Solana wallet address. Will airdrop you governance tokens for your participation in our war efforts

Although this document can not prevent someone from impersonating you online, it can help prevent them from gathering information used in identity theft. 

For those in the US, I highly recommend the Opting out of data aggregator section.

[10/7/22, 2:53:17 PM] Gary Teh: Well… the DDOS is being setup right this moment. Just let us know if they are keen to cooperate by removing all unauthorized content by this evening 🙂
[10/7/22, 2:53:51 PM] Gary Teh: Their site is going to Nuked… if they do not cooperate by midnight

[10/7/22, 3:10:41 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished chatting with @17755088150 just now over coffee 

We were discussing that is is going to be part of a defensive suite that we offer members of standing in our DAO network as protection against malicious actors 

The other two being 

1. A new Chrome extension that automatically disable wallet connect buttons on DApps identified by members as having dubious intent 

2. Automatic monitoring and reporting of websites with unauthorized use of network member profiles (much like what happened to @17164453763 today ) 

 Nine members can either pay to access this service or start contributing to our network via this rubric to gain protection  
https://TrueSight.me/rubric 

@17755088150 is going to talk about this defensive suite when she is at bogota for DevCon next week
[10/7/22, 3:12:44 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of which @19514467219 @17755088150 helps artist facilitate and promote offline events for their airdrops if they are considering to tokenize their art as NFTs. She is familiar with the logistic side and is also connected with quite a few venue providers 

I am aware that you are tapped into an entire network of artist. I believe there is some synergy there. 🙂
[10/7/22, 3:14:01 PM] Gary Teh: Not sure if anyone knows of the operators for Art Basel. But would be great if we could help setup @17755088150 as a speaker to share this defensive suite our DAO is making available to the rest of the web3 community 🙂
[10/7/22, 3:18:48 PM] Gary Teh: Since @17164453763 and @17755088150 are the inceptors of this needs, maybe you want to do the honors of giving the defensive suite a name? 🙂
[10/7/22, 3:29:12 PM] Francois renet: Let’s connect with Sarah @14153000019! Had a conversation today with major players in music world doing NFTs and a new merch concept. All on Web3. Tomorrow connecting with them AMD a buddy who does concerts in LA.
[10/7/22, 3:30:14 PM] Francois renet: Again. Let’s chat with Sarah. We are going to have a pop up gallery in Miami for Art Basel and doing a few things with emerging artists and music.
[10/7/22, 3:32:12 PM] Francois renet: @14153000019 @17755088150   Let’s try and speak on Wednesday as we will be in London after that for the art fair. Let’s also discuss an article on the suite in the NFT special issue coming out mid-December
[10/7/22, 3:36:39 PM] Gary Teh: Cool! Let’s do that! @17755088150 what time is good 🙂
[10/7/22, 3:38:46 PM] Sarah H.: Hi @19514467219 what time zone will you be in on Wednesday?

[10/7/22, 3:40:07 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: So I’m actually kinda glad this all happened because I’m learning a lot!
[10/7/22, 3:40:55 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: We are still listed on the site 

I sent them an email that said 

“All unauthorized materials are to be removed by midnight PST. 

Thanks.”
[10/7/22, 3:41:01 PM] Sarah H.: I really like something around Guardians
[10/7/22, 3:41:22 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: I keep checking … will keep everyone posted
[10/7/22, 3:41:49 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: @17755088150  — a conservation project I know of uses “Guardians” and I liked it as well. Nemus.earth
[10/7/22, 3:42:53 PM] Sarah H.: So maybe Cyber Guardian or Cypher Guardians
[10/7/22, 3:43:17 PM] Sarah H.: I like Cypher for the association with Cypher Punk
[10/7/22, 3:56:10 PM] Sarah H.: Cypher Guardian ?!?
[10/7/22, 3:56:29 PM] Gary Teh: Love it! @17164453763 thoughts?

[10/7/22, 4:29:22 PM] Jacki - Supply Chain: I am admittedly a total n00b in this arena. I’m trying to learn more about the Apache stuff you provided.

[10/7/22, 4:43:56 PM] Gary Teh: I think the most concerning thing is if any monetize fraud gets committed and associated back to this website, the fraudster will get away scot-free but both you and and Alex will have to deal with the repercussions because both your DOXed profiles are listed there.
[10/7/22, 4:44:39 PM] Gary Teh: And since its a Web3 project, functionalities associated with Wallet will very likely come into play

[10/8/22, 3:08:40 PM] Sarah H.: I like Afuri!
[10/8/22, 3:12:15 PM] Gary Teh: I was looking through all the verticals that Meta already had it’s claws on. At the rate this is going the following companies are going to end up getting disrupted 

Yelp - food industry 
Amazon - e-commerce 
Match - dating 
EventBrite - events 

One of the principles we keep in mind a lot when thinking about network effects is the idea of tapping into high frequency uses cases. 

If an app is able to latch onto a high frequency use case, it is going to have a way easier time displacing another app which is occupying a lower frequency use case. 

Out of the three competitors out there, Facebook, Robolox and Unreal engine, I would probably be more bullish on Facebook since they already have all the Meta data of 1/3 of the worlds users 

Thoughts?
[10/8/22, 3:13:33 PM] Brian -IOM: Have you been following the Elon Musk Twitter "everything app" story?
[10/8/22, 3:14:02 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Was exploring through the Instagram app when I discovered Afuri. Already I am thinking of heading over for dinner later 🤤

[10/8/22, 3:16:06 PM] Brian -IOM: WeChat focuses on high freqency use cases
[10/8/22, 3:16:32 PM] Brian -IOM: And has 1 billion users in China
[10/8/22, 3:21:52 PM] Gary Teh: The main difference between Twitter and WeChat is that everyone on Twitter is anonymous 

In WeChat, the operator knows down to the mobile phone itself which yields a lot of data 

Also the privacy policy of China was relatively loose compared to the US. Now that the CCP has gotten its claws into WeChat, citizens are further encouraged to give up more information 

Whereas in the west, citizens were at the onset already quite paranoid about privacy and the regulations has now further made it a pain in the ass 

If Twitter were merged with Tesla, that would be a very nice complement to create a full stack consumer solution

Suddenly the Tesla gains the social dimension while Twitter gains the hardware and actual identity dimension
[10/8/22, 5:17:38 PM] Brian -IOM: Musk is clearly signalling his intention to turn Twitter into a "super app" - which by my reckoning includes crypto payments. Would that require KYC?...
[10/8/22, 5:31:40 PM] Gary Teh: Given his maverick style of operating he would probably give the authorities that demand for KYC the 🖕🤣
[10/8/22, 5:33:34 PM] Peter Peng: He’s only like that because he works for the government and can do that.
[10/8/22, 5:38:31 PM] Brian -IOM: I've no idea what to make of him. Sometimes I think he's an independent, sometimes I think wtf am I thinking!

[10/8/22, 5:40:45 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why he’s building humanoid robots instead of cars
[10/8/22, 5:42:05 PM] Peter Peng: 😂 conspiracy theory or truth? I’ll let @14153000019 verify.

[10/8/22, 5:45:29 PM] Peter Peng: Haha yeah
[10/8/22, 5:46:23 PM] Gary Teh: I came to come to this conclusion a while back, something’s can be physically validated, those we can tackle and solve within our Network

Others don’t easily lend themselves to validation so only God knows. 🤣

It's amazing to hear people about how they were brought up, and why they did what they had to do!
[10/9/22, 1:41:01 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of movie, I just got invited to act in one that one of the folks here in Portland is filming for Halloween

[10/9/22, 9:06:45 AM] Gary Teh: Since I will very likely be in Portland during this forthcoming week, let me go whip up the initial base chrome extension we were describing about. 

That way interested members can go install it on their brave browser when it is ready to. 🙂

I think the cool by product of this is that right now, you need to manually navigate pages to earn BAT. 

If they enable a specific mode, they could theoretically be earning BAT passively and also be earning governance tokens in our DAO
[10/9/22, 12:08:42 PM] Sarah H.: Are you parked in a safe place ?
[10/9/22, 12:09:28 PM] Sarah H.: And - rad. Can the crawlers be directed to find contact about malicious  DAPPS that have already been talked about on socials
[10/9/22, 12:30:09 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. Been mainly parked around the area of the micro brewery that you shared the other day. It's generally very quiet at night.

the coffee roasteries and cafes are great to work out of during mornings and afternoons.
the Quad area for dinner and chilling. The food at the Ming republic is really cheap. Also somehow even though I have been mainly just ordering coke there, unexpected servings of alcohol somehow come my way on and off. 

Seems when idea of a house gets redefined and the four walls removed it ends up somewhat decentralized. 🤔
[10/9/22, 12:34:00 PM] Sarah H.: Portland tends to take care of the “Rubber Tramps” so may be why you see that alcohol popping up here and there. 

My neighborhood is semi quite at night. If you decide you want to be in a residential area. Let me know and I’ll shoot you the address of my driveway. 

Yes, when home is truly where the heart is and it isn’t a define space, space expands.
[10/9/22, 12:37:30 PM] Gary Teh: cool! I see that now. 🤩

Heaven is my roof and Earth is my bed. 😎

[10/9/22, 1:09:18 PM] Sarah H.: this could be seen as the whole DAO as a state concept in play right now. Washing the vegetables is not needing the kings… others are still paying court (taxes, consumerism, etc. )
[10/9/22, 1:12:24 PM] Sarah H.: I am curious the difference between a want for autonomy or for  sovereignty
[10/9/22, 1:16:57 PM] Gary Teh: That is a very good question. My perspective is autonomy is relatively more limited in scope. You can enjoy autonomy in whatever space you operate in, however it can quickly vanish as soon as the Ruler of the domain decides otherwise and steps in to disrupt it.

Sovereignty means you are technically become the ruler of your space. If you want to foster autonomy within the space you are ruler of great, if you want to foster some other forms of governing style within that space its your choice too.
[10/9/22, 1:31:09 PM] Sarah H.: I see
[10/9/22, 5:05:55 PM] Gary Teh: @17755088150 I just finished crafting a page on our network's website which describes how the tokenomics for Cypher defense might work once it's released.

https://truesight.me/dao#cypher

Will follow up with @48691650760 sometime next week to figure out how to utilize it for new DAO member onboarding

@19514467219 you might find it useful as well for our discussion on Tuesday 🙂
[10/9/22, 6:59:13 PM] Gary Teh: Tuning the backend server now. 

Once that is done will start looking at the browser extension layer 🙂
[10/9/22, 7:05:51 PM] Peter Peng: Can we pop both at the same time?
[10/9/22, 7:09:34 PM] Gary Teh: Interesting you asking. I think based on the RGB calculation it will end up becoming a purple pill. 

When I did a quick google search for popular purple pills two different type showed up. 

So I guess you still get to choose between two 🤣

[10/9/22, 8:57:27 PM] Gary Teh: @48606646246 and @8618926086648 I was thinking through the join our discussion portion of it 

Right now it only features online text based discussions

I was wondering if you would be keen to extend to include online FaceTime discussion that IOM is holding two times weekly (@48606646246) and  IRL events that OffChain periodically holds (@8618926086648) 🙂

@8618926086648 and @14152032783 I should be back in the bay by end of this month. Happy to catch up. Also @17755088150 will be in town then too. She is doing Emceeing for a conference there. I would be very happy if we could all catch up then? 🙂

I wonder if you would be keen to extend

[10/9/22, 9:30:44 PM] Gary Teh: The fraudulent server administrator when looking through his logs will only see random legitimate ip addresses each of which making only 1 single call each. 

Then the only thing he can do is blame himself to not doing a proper infrastructure setup for his backend 🤔🤣
[10/9/22, 9:38:33 PM] Gary Teh: I was furthering thinking through the Brave browser BAT mining mechanism 

Right now, a user has to manually click and navigate across multiple pages to earn these BAT tokens each of which is worth USD0.30

If a chrome extension user of ours got it installed on his/her brave browser, this theoretically turns that browser into an automated miner. 

So while the browser is helping us with power our decentralized anti-fraud protocol it is also helping the owner mine for BAT.

This means the owner gets to double dip both in earning our tokens as well as BAT tokens. 

It’s a beautiful economic model 🤩
[10/9/22, 9:39:15 PM] Gary Teh: @48606646246  brave browser was such a wonderful introduction you made 🙂
[10/9/22, 9:53:40 PM] Gary Teh: On a side note, this could also be repackaged as a enterprise solution.

Tech companies need this service for benchmarking their own infrastructure too.

I remember it being a total pain in the ass when I had to setup the infrastructure to do load testing on all our server backend in Edmodo to see identify poorly performing REST API end points. 

If there was such a service back then I would have tossed in some cash to save my own time
[10/9/22, 10:20:28 PM] Tres Garcia: Yes. I am working on a project now where was are load testing for what I would thing is a small number of users. 

It’s easy to forget / take for granted how something as simple as a X# of users can bring the network down.
[10/9/22, 10:25:38 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah. Also depending on your choice of language, the amount of concurrent load a server can handle will also defer 

I remember I was rewriting the crawlers for https://GetData.IO and was choosing between four languages so as to ensure the crawler could run on a EC2 micro instance without choking up 🤣

Would be happy to find out more about your project if you are keen to share it here too 🙂
[10/9/22, 10:51:47 PM] Tres Garcia: Client work. So that about as deep as I’ll go on the topic. Web 2.0 stuff… so no biggie.
[10/9/22, 10:52:00 PM] Tres Garcia: But thank you!!!

Please do feel free to join us there 🙂

https://chat.whatsapp.com/Li3Y6Idnh7t7M9xWT5DC1U
[10/10/22, 8:34:07 PM] Gary Teh: After the chat we had this morning, I spent this afternoon thinking about these often quoted themes of “social impact” and “changing the world for ….” 

Technically we don’t. You can spend your time building and making a tool publicly available.  however if folks in the community are not keen to adopt it, then there is net zero impact however “great” the tool is. 

So the more accurate description is all the individuals in a community saw how their individual lives could be slightly more improved if they adopted some new tools/practices. Collectively these individual decisions caused the world to change itself. 

The tool maker is just a participant in the change process. From this perspective to claim anything more than that almost starts coming across as somewhat grandiose bordering on hubris if not delusional 🤔
[10/10/22, 8:36:18 PM] Gary Teh: That happened during the Arab-Israel war. 

Coincidentally that was also what caused USD to fall off the gold standard 

now that US is on the cusp of fully abandoning the Bretonwood system, it feels like dejavu to see the same scene arise
[10/11/22, 1:18:32 AM] Francois renet: So well put @14153000019 . I had two incredible conversations this week. One with the founder of the Hip Hop Film Festival, and another with the manager of one of the top rappers out there. The conversations went very deep since i was asking them about how they grew up. Long conversation short, I realized that because of all the tip toeing we do around ourselves, and our different cultures, we never have meaningful conversations - mainly - w don't build bridges, rather we build what i've come to refer as bridges of paper, just strong enough to scratch the surface, but that fall apart when we really talk about deep matters. We need to have more meaningful conversations. dig deeper. share more. until that happens, i'm afraid not much will change.
[10/11/22, 6:48:45 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Perfect. Great realization. What could that look like in our lives? Even on the microscopic level. Sharing with the people around you in your immediate environment is one idea 😃

[10/11/22, 12:07:15 PM] Francois renet: We’ll be in Zurich all month I believe!
[10/11/22, 12:27:36 PM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 by the way, it just occurred @48691650760 is a writer and contributes to another magazine as well. I thought since both of you are in the publication industry, there might be some synergy that could be had. She actively explores the Web3 projects out there and writes about them. 

I wonder if there might be an opportunity for her to submit contributions to TheArtTalkMagazine? These are the potential areas that come to mind off the top of my head

- Sourcing for interesting Web3 projects
- Conducting interviews with these Web3 projects
- Writing about these Web3 projects

To support this collaboration in good spirit, we are happy to tokenize activities of her contribution on our ledger as well as tokenize the event when TheArtTalkMagazine publishes her publications on our ledger when they occur. 🙂

https://truesight.me/ledger
[10/11/22, 12:36:18 PM] Francois renet: Of course @14153000019 ! We can’t pay our writers for now, but they get to write for an obscure mag! 😂

[10/11/22, 12:42:34 PM] Gary Teh: Well. I am sure network members will be happy and open to contribute in exchange for governance tokens in our TrueSight DAO Network. 🙂

From my perspective, in terms of ecosystem outreach

    - The ArtTalk Magazine is the online publication arm
    - Infinitely Open Minds is the online events arm
    - OffChain Global is the in real life events arm

Definitely happy to award TrueSight DAO Network governances tokens for contributions by network members in any of these areas. 🙂

[10/11/22, 3:42:07 PM] Aga - DAOist: Wow... I have more there in mind/in my files so get ready and let's talk next week 😎💫

I see that you really love tokenizing everything 🤣❤️ And thank you for understanding that I don't want to tokenize our friendship 🥰🙏

[10/12/22, 7:09:28 AM] Francois renet: Will absolutely do intro. She is brilliant!
[10/12/22, 7:21:19 AM] Gary Teh: Just observed another synchronicity 🤩

Speaking of real estate, just finished first rounds of discussions with @6598383264 on something related 

Not sure if any of you saw the movie John Wick by Keanu Reeves. The Continental is a hotel that assassins in the guild check into where all forms of service and amenities are provided 

https://youtu.be/Au_V6ng5zBs
[10/12/22, 7:25:12 AM] Gary Teh: We are in the process of building up such a facility in Los Angeles to be operated by Hyatt 

Once that is done, any DAO member who comes to the hotel and can proof he has governance tokens can free use of the meeting room for the day. Can bring up to 1 guest
[10/12/22, 7:28:34 AM] Gary Teh: Still discussing the rest of the details will share more when they become finalized 🙂
[10/12/22, 3:25:49 PM] Francois renet: You’re building the Cosmopolitan @14153000019?
[10/12/22, 3:42:38 PM] Gary Teh: I guess… 🤣

I am imagining a base like this scattered across different parts of the world where all network members can migrate around during different parts of the year 🤩
[10/12/22, 3:45:37 PM] Francois renet: My friend. I have just what you need!

[10/13/22, 1:25:41 PM] Aga - DAOist: Yeah.. there are many layers of problems and most see/focus only on the surface, not on the core problems 🤔 that is how on every meeting we end up getting to individual self-awareness and mindset 🤣
[10/13/22, 1:46:43 PM] Gary Teh: @2348123243309  @48606646246 has some idea for research into the personal security space, perhaps you would work like to collaborate with her ?
[10/13/22, 1:47:58 PM] Gary Teh: Once we have assembled the list of top personal security concerns surfaced during this chat 
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyjob_web3-web3-web3-activity-6986411321999187968-oOKj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

[10/15/22, 12:17:14 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/15/22, 12:17:28 PM] Gary Teh: I spent sometime this morning to further elaborate on the Thesis behind EcoVerse21 after some request for further clarification by @6598622082. 


The main thesis
--------
Africa after decades of foreign aid from the West still does not have the necessary infrastructure in place to float their own economy. The main bottleneck right now is firstly lack of financing availability for locals to start their businesses and secondly lack of job opportunities for locals to gain capital through work. 

Right now, China is trying to aid the development of this region through the belt road initiative. This does not alleviate the above described bottleneck. Bulk of these Chinese loans are channelled back to Chinese construction companies never passing through the hands of locals, while local governments are left saddled with expensive debt which they cannot finance. The subsequent defaults lead to commandeering of built infrastructure by Chinese authorities. Meanwhile, Chinese money is pouring in with the goal of buying out resource rich patches of land from the locals who lack the capital to develop it themselves.

While there is a current Web3 trend which aims to alleviate the economic situation via Play To Earn models, this is ultimately unsustainable as long term solutions as there is no concrete and sound fundamental economics backing these. Bulk of them are driven by the mania that the NFTs associated with the Play to Earn games will keep increasing over time. Price trends observed over the past year has proven otherwise. Total population of full time employed Play to Earn workers the world over has fallen by around 90% year to date.

When we take a step back to examine the full picture, Africa is rich in natural resources and generates a lot of foreign revenue through these exports. In the mid to long term, China will increasingly rely on Africa for its food supplies while Western Europe will increasingly rely on Africa for its own energy supplies. Right now bulk of the margin is kept profit by the middle men. Given the increasing observed reliance and profit margin, this presents an opportunity for us to establish an alternate trade route to channel resources through. 

When we take into account the aging population problem that is happening right now in most industrialized nations, it becomes imperative we start building up the economy and education system of areas of the world where next generations youthful work force will be coming from. Africa is one of this regions where a substantial portion of the population is still youthful.

This goal of this alternate set of trade routes is to redirect surplus generated back to these African communities to power the financing of new business thereby creating new jobs opportunities. The end goal is a self sustaining eco-system that is no longer at the mercy of external entities which can foster our next generation of global work force

[10/15/22, 3:14:12 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Thanks for the invite Gary. I am a DAO newbie and very much looking forward to first insights. I am from Switzerland and I am passionate about building my own cosmetic impact brand. Circular economy is the key to it. Transparent supply chains, material health, social fairness, water and soil stewardship and recycling are part of it. I am an entrepreneur with a holistic approach. My journey so far has been multi-faceted and non-linear, which is why I also hope to be able to contribute positively to the DAO.
[10/15/22, 3:20:37 PM] Gary Teh: Thank you for introducing yourself! 🙂

I believe the following chatrooms in our network will also be interesting for you 

Agrihood - we share ideas on how to setup sustainable food production for ourselves

[10/15/22, 8:20:21 PM] Gary Teh: Mango Market just got hacked, and Solana is trading below USD30 per coin. What are your thoughts? 

https://truesight.me/companies/SOL-USD/2022-10-13/90
[10/15/22, 8:34:27 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Time to roll out a less drama #coin
[10/15/22, 8:36:09 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Flaws in #solana

1. PoH only needs 33% consensus (a big design issue)
2. Although, they have grander vision for faster TPS (their mempool, by design, is flawed and cannot scale)
[10/15/22, 8:40:26 PM] Gary Teh: What are better ways of proving? 🙂
[10/15/22, 8:41:34 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: 51% consensus is needed
[10/15/22, 8:42:25 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: This may take a hit on consensus arriving speed, but can lessen the hacks every other day that is happening in solana network

[10/15/22, 9:47:42 PM] Gary Teh: How is the hackathon you had this project participate?
[10/16/22, 9:24:31 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: You said so much here! I noticed Uganda just discovered 100% of the gold supply $12 trillion in their ground. I hope they get to keep some of it! 

Also the new BRICS currency is being rolled out as “the new world reserve currency”. 

What I like about it is that options are good and the more people that realize they have options, the more freedom they will feel! Namaste
[10/16/22, 9:25:39 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Looks great. What is the “why”? 💗💫🚀
[10/16/22, 9:50:04 AM] Satheesh Paddolker: @17206665895 

Hence #monytyze
[10/17/22, 1:34:04 AM] Marta: Mental and physical :)
[10/17/22, 8:44:38 PM] Gary Teh: I look through your deck. 

I see your attempt at monetization is quite similar in genre to the following two projects in that you are trying to find an alternative monetization model to our current Ad model 

Brave Browser BAT coin combo - browser users get paid to view ads. While part of the proceeds gets channeled back ti browser developer 

JoinMassive decentralized cloud infrastructure - in exchange for using app for free part of user’s cpu is utilized for mining monero which is paid back to app developers 

What I don’t see clearly is what is the utility you are providing to end users to keep them coming back. That portion of your two sided model is missing or if it is it is not well explained in your deck 🤔
[10/17/22, 8:45:24 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: White paper is in progress
[10/17/22, 8:45:28 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Abstract can be seen below
‎[10/17/22, 8:45:37 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: ‎image omitted
[10/17/22, 9:35:12 PM] Gary Teh: You will be stuck with the chicken and egg problem 

Why would content creators want to use your platform instead of other problems with more human traffic passing through? 🤔
[10/17/22, 9:36:26 PM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Jerry when they attempted the same with FireWork. They burnt more than 10 million USD to build out this eco-system but it’s a leaky bucket with low to no retention
[10/17/22, 9:36:56 PM] Gary Teh: They ended up pivoting to an enterprise solution where the utility is clear and obvious. Hence retention
[10/17/22, 9:38:47 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: As compared with #instagram or #facebook, content creators in #monytyze actually make money
[10/17/22, 9:39:17 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: where as #insta and #fb are making #mark more richer
[10/17/22, 9:40:02 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: if you look deeply, #insta made 47.6B in AD revenues from the content uploaded by 98% of the social medial users that are not on #blockchain yet
[10/17/22, 9:40:43 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Enabling these users make real money from their content is what #monytyze believes in
[10/17/22, 9:41:15 PM] Gary Teh: The trend right now is that micro influencers are directly targeted and paid by companies to create content 

Companies are shying away from paying ads
[10/17/22, 9:43:43 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: what %?
[10/17/22, 9:43:58 PM] Gary Teh: A bounty based approach might be interesting 

However there are already solutions for that

Me and Vijay were exploring into that last year when he wanted to implemented such a strategy for his. E-commerce company and was thinking of engaging my help to do so. 

And the way I did so was by not engaging my personal time to build the solution but to redirect him to the existing solutions
[10/17/22, 9:44:29 PM] Gary Teh: There should be some reports out there 

Go dig it out 🙂
[10/17/22, 9:44:53 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: https://www.oberlo.in/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics
[10/17/22, 9:45:00 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Found this..🙂
[10/17/22, 9:51:46 PM] Gary Teh: A quick simple acid test is this 

If @48606646246 @17164453763 @447703987755 @2348123243309 @17755088150 (all of whom are every influential content creators) are feeling excited after reading the proposed solution then the unique value proposition is appealing 

If there is not much enthusiasm observed then some research on the qualitative side needs to be done and the concept tweaked
[10/17/22, 9:51:59 PM] Gary Teh: 🤔

[10/17/22, 9:59:54 PM] Gary Teh: @6581766589 maybe setup a dedicated what’s app chatroom and share the invite link here. That way interested network members can jump in and you can share more details there 

This will avoid spamming the main channel with details other network members are not interested 🙂
[10/17/22, 10:00:16 PM] Gary Teh: That is how we started doing it with other network projects 🙂
[10/17/22, 10:00:55 PM] Gary Teh: Will update this list once the invite link is available

[10/17/22, 10:13:28 PM] Gary Teh: One thing I love about the folks here in the network is that representation is so well rounded 

You can quickly get a sense of whether an idea will be well received before any further work is done on it

In that regard @14075792560 is quite smart, he already slaughtered his previous idea and pivoted to something new 

@14075792560 want to do a quick share of what you have been up to lately? 🙂
‎[10/17/22, 10:31:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/17/22, 10:57:36 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I guess everyone is doing it. All online marketing people I deal with focus on it. To buy adds will stay necessary to play the algorithm, to reach you target group you want to identify your micro influencers to really connect with them.
[10/17/22, 11:06:17 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks for the insightful inputs @41765737357 🙂🙏

It just occurred to me you are managing a consumer brand too. Being able to identify micro influencers that you can engage with will be super impactful 🙂

This was the solution I directed Vijay to

https://www.upfluence.com/

When me and @16468233438 used it for a go to market campaign via micro influencers last year, we realized their statistics reported we’re not very accurate. 

We engaged 3 micro influencers and paid them USD1250 each for a series of posts Part in fiat part in tokens. 

If there was a platform for that, I am sure web3 influencers would be happy to engage

So rather than being a B2C solution. It will be a b2B market place 🙂
[10/17/22, 11:09:48 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/17/22, 11:12:06 PM] Gary Teh: If there were a bounty based platform like this that pays out in tokens, my sense is value conscious influencers would be keen and happy to engage their personal brand power to promote the consumer brands listed based on brand needs

In your case @41765737357 , your brand’s social value is very clear and obvious. A consumer brand based on circular economy to fight climate change 

I would switch my entire toiletries to yours once it’s available in the US for distribution 🙂🙏
[10/17/22, 11:24:04 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is a brilliant idea! It is what I am looking for. I believe people should be involved in all that is being created. So they can be part of it. 

More and more, the consumer is not willing to spend money on strangers. Now they whant to buy from theis Influencers, their friends, next, they want to be part of it all. 

And concerning circularity it all makes sense as well. Knowing where your product goes, getting the packaging back to send it back to to its cycles. And more options probably tracking the supply chain. Being able to reward all those being part of it.

Doesn’t seem like we need to come up with our own implementation anymore unless there is some gap that is not covered yet.

I need to thank Reed Hastings and his company for helping finance my entire trip across the US and then up to Alaska and back over the past six months. 🤣

Time to hunt for something else to finance my next trip down to Antartica. 🤩

[10/18/22, 1:58:31 PM] Gary Teh: @12023686334 looking forward to reading your market thesis on CoinBase. 🙂
[10/18/22, 3:41:06 PM] Gary Teh: And our bounty system is up and running at https://truesight.me/dao/bounties

A round of applause to @48691650760 for figuring out this solution! We have been stuck for months trying to find one that would work for us. This solution felt like a match made in heaven!! 🤩❤️🌈

[10/18/22, 8:31:01 PM] Gary Teh: Cool! How do I read this??
[10/18/22, 8:32:10 PM] Tres Garcia: This assumes: 
27.8% YOY growth between now and 2030
COIN will have growth in their main rev generator of 
2023: 10%
2024: 27%
2025: 27% 
2026: 20%
and 2027 of 10%
[10/18/22, 8:33:21 PM] Tres Garcia: Today's market cap is $14B
The est. market cap in 2027 will be $70B
[10/18/22, 8:34:08 PM] Tres Garcia: The big takeaway is that they are being looked at as the leader for custodial service. 

Check out their 10Q wiht a bump in $88B in custodial assets. (*This is NOT retail investors)
‎[10/18/22, 8:35:13 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎image omitted
[10/18/22, 8:37:07 PM] Tres Garcia: My thesis: Love them or hate them... Coinbase will dominate the future of crypto as a bridge between banks because they are a trusted leader and have the infrastructure to do what other can not. They will 2x / 4x because they can sit back and "do nothing" while their automated infrastructure generates transaction income.
[10/18/22, 8:37:33 PM] Tres Garcia: * I do not own Coinbase at this time. 
I will probably enter a position soon.

[10/20/22, 12:32:53 AM] Marvin: I’m in Berlin now and I’ve seen people knit in cafes and all over the place, I guess it’s a hipster thing
[10/20/22, 12:45:29 AM] Jonathan: If you find someone to set up OffChain Portland, please let us know.. we are also trying in Seattle.
[10/20/22, 12:48:35 AM] Francois renet: as far as i can remember germans have always been big knitters
[10/20/22, 1:01:01 AM] Marvin: Maybe, my grandma loves to knit, I don’t know too many young people though, but I know many people who are looking for something like that as a stress relief, diamond paintings are super popular here now too
[10/20/22, 1:28:14 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Living in Zurich, but I used to live in Berlin I can only guess: The eco conscious Berlin hipster society is preparing for a tough winter. Already now I have heard of families that can’t afford heating anymore. Germany has made huge mistakes by taking the exit of nuclear energy not organizing alternatives. Now pipelines have been sabotaged and Putin is doing the rest. So knitting wool seems to be the affordable solution. And besides it shows a little movement against the using of technology all the time (phone needs energy). So it would be to underline the ‘I am safing energy, I am a social being’ what we have seen evolving strongly in this part of the world during the pandemic. People very strongly want to show their commitment and show flag (as we have the saying in German). In true sense of the word in the case of the ukrainian war. It is a trend, to strongly judge and even motivate others to do so. Show your efforts of being social and somehow trying to survive and deal with their panic, because the world has changed.

[10/20/22, 10:12:24 AM] Gary Teh: The market cap of Google is more than 100X of Coinbase. If google is planning to accept more crypto payments for its services, I don’t see why it wouldn’t just outright buy the whole company over. It would just be a small dip in the ocean
[10/20/22, 10:15:09 AM] Gary Teh: When salesforce acquired slack last year, their market cap difference was around just 20X
[10/21/22, 5:02:36 AM] Sarah H.: I think so. It’s cool to read a book in a bar here too.
[10/21/22, 6:00:11 AM] Tres Garcia: It rather see them buy voyager or Celsius and make people whole. (Won’t happen) 
But they could buy the components during the bankruptcy auction.
[10/21/22, 6:00:39 AM] Tres Garcia: Code = cheap
They will still need to hire developer.

Or is there a better way for us to organize tasks? 

I’ve used Trello for team organization but Open to anyones input for remote workspaces!
[10/21/22, 12:02:32 PM] Gary Teh: Nothing much yet for the next project that @6581766589 is working on. Not sure if he is open to pivoting

[10/21/22, 8:03:24 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me since I could technically pay for google cloud with crypto couldn’t I just mine crypto using google cloud and then pay them using the crypto I mined??
[10/21/22, 8:10:09 PM] Gary Teh: This arrangement reduces the friction of having to deal with the hassle of on ramp and off ramp. My hunch is it would make google the default google cloud provider for mining

This could have the potential of pole vaulting google cloud from number 3 cloud provider to become number 1 ahead of Amazon AWS and Microsoft azure
[10/21/22, 8:12:01 PM] Jonathan: I think the cost of mining with AWS is too  high though generally to be profitable. I could be wrong though
[10/21/22, 8:12:48 PM] Gary Teh: Depends on the chain right? Especially now that Ethereum is proof of stake
[10/21/22, 8:17:23 PM] Jonathan: Before for AWS they are all about 100% uptime but for mining you don’t need that and to have was expensive. However maybe they have a separate service for it
[10/21/22, 8:17:25 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: Have to stake 32 ETH though
[10/21/22, 8:26:38 PM] Gary Teh: Mine monero! 🤣

[10/23/22, 8:05:44 PM] Jonathan: I feel like moving people to telegram is not so hard from WhatsApp but moving to discord is. Also I feel like discord feels like a very heavy app so people may not want to open it - that’s how I feel. Finally if you are trying to include new people with whatever you are doing, discord is a no starter. I find people in the US trust telegram more than WhatsApp which is interesting since it started in Russia.
[10/23/22, 8:07:44 PM] Jonathan: Not being able to delete messages after a couple days is really tough in WhatsApp also not being able to pin messages. WeChat is even worse as you can’t delete a message after about 30 seconds that you or anyone else wrote and the group Maximum is 500 people. Also people can only be added manually after 200 members of a group.
[10/23/22, 8:08:02 PM] Jonathan: I see people outside praising WeChat as so great but except for payment telegram is way better
[10/23/22, 8:59:48 PM] Gary Teh: I think it probably differs by demographic as well. I know @6598383264 Is way more active on WeChat than WhatsApp
[10/23/22, 10:29:45 PM] Jonathan: yes most of the people in China are only active on WeChat because they need a VPN to get out and it is so much easier to use, even foreigners.
[10/23/22, 10:32:33 PM] Jonathan: won't breakout past WeChat. I actually don't see the use of not being able to delete messages. For censorship the government can always still see the deleted messages. Lots of times in WeChat you will end up with someone accidentally sending personal messages to a group and that often can reveal some private information to people and it can not be deleted.

[10/24/22, 11:25:40 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I believe the best is to give people the truth and leave them with options for desicion making. When we judge we are not better than others. Isn’t it the greatest place if we all have the same valuable informations but we are encouraged to make our own desicions? I think the fake news are all about taking this option from us. Getting people to follow and not to think themselves. 

There will always be a lot of dirt, is it in our power to clean it or can we enable people to deal with it?
[10/24/22, 11:33:14 PM] Gary Teh: I see we as everybody, so everybody enables everybody else to deal with it. It’s a collective effort 

Yes! The proliferation of online Fake news/shit/manipulation erodes the integrity of fifth estate, deprives us individuals of our autonomy and polarizes the world thereby removing diversity of all the gradients that use to exist between artificial polar opposite.
[10/24/22, 11:39:23 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: So the mission is to eradicate fake news and break up the polarized world to give autonomy and diversity back to individuals?

[10/27/22, 7:55:13 AM] Gary Teh: Meta’s $677 Billion Rout Boots It Out of World’s Top 20 Stocks 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-27/meta-s-spiralling-rout-puts-it-on-brink-of-losing-top-20-status
[10/27/22, 10:14:17 AM] Johnson Teh: In the long run, META is still a good stock to get, no one have the largest Metaverse property in the world than them. of cos the application will take some time to gain traction and monetization, but "FB" knows advert best when comes to "V-community" setting  

way too many Human are too weak to make it pass their door, least to mentione to Mar,
hence META is the most economical way for them to be truly happy, they can live in their own grand META world to feel good.

The computing power to be harness from such V-city can be huge... imaging majority of the ppl stay behind on earth and help to serve in others in Mar virtually with a "phase-in" setting such as operating a drones to build the city.

[10/27/22, 10:19:22 AM] Johnson Teh: News are might to "Shocked" readers for its intented purpose of gaing eyeballs.

It is neither meant to be educational nor informative, news readers ought to understand this, 
we are barking up the wrong tree if we are calling this norm as abnormality... 

of cos partly to blame is the fact that Mark of FB is an unloved person in SV, 
not that Mark Z shld care, at his age and wealth, he can have a F-You Human vibe anytime all the time, lol🤣 which is why I think he is the best CEO to be running a META proj on Earth now
[10/27/22, 10:22:10 AM] Gary Teh: Not if Elon Musk comes in with a bigger F- You Human vibe 🤣

[10/27/22, 10:39:25 AM] Johnson Teh: they are in two diff dir, out is outward, another is inward, there are no conflict between them
[10/27/22, 10:39:56 AM] Johnson Teh: their commom pt is that both are as un-loved 🤣

[10/27/22, 1:54:31 PM] Abhinav: Thank you guys
[10/27/22, 1:56:31 PM] Gary Teh: It’s not the odometer. It’s the temperature of the engine

[10/27/22, 2:18:23 PM] Tres Garcia: So... The last time META (FB) was $1.91 eps 
People were willing to pay 
$190 per share (Sep 2019) 28x Earnings  (Book value = $29 per share)
and 
$242 per share (Sep 2020) 29x earnings... (Book value = $35 per share)

Today it is $97.94 (Oct 27, 2022) 7.9x earnings (Book value $45.56)
Yup... Feeling good about opening a small position in META (FB) today.

[10/27/22, 2:24:20 PM] Gary Teh: YOLO!! I fully exited all my NFLX position and went all in on META. 

I am going to ride Mark Zuckerberg for my Antarctica trip!! 🤩

I'm Young, I'm very happy to join you.😁
[10/27/22, 2:31:13 PM] Gary Teh: We were doing a lot of market research together when we were in Belgrad 

@381616396462 is a very professional researcher when it comes to visual aesthetic 🤣
[10/27/22, 2:36:15 PM] Y: Hahaha, but our market research did not get good results, we hope to occupy the Belgrade market in the future
[10/27/22, 2:39:07 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! Zero percent conversion rate!! 

Would have been more successful if we just joined the Do Nothing society during that time 🤣

[10/27/22, 4:01:42 PM] Gary Teh: Here you go 
https://youtu.be/fPTJpRdkGC0

Some parts of it have became alittle outdated based on the learnings over the past few months
[10/27/22, 4:02:32 PM] Gary Teh: Specifically we removed the social ranking aspects of DAOs as that only introduced undesirable zero sum game dynamics into the system
[10/27/22, 4:07:54 PM] Gary Teh: I believe the key principle to abide by when constructing DAOs tokenomics is to watch out for and avoid accidentally introducing zero sum games I. There

[10/27/22, 4:45:47 PM] Gary Teh: It might seem like I am joking but counter intuitively being able to return back to Doing Nothing is actually the key to keeping any zero sum game dynamics in check. Which is why I keep on bringing it up over and over again 

https://TrueSight.me/do-nothing
[10/27/22, 4:48:32 PM] Aga - DAOist: Then you actually keep on doing sth... 😅 you spam us and we can't really focus on doing nothing 🤦‍♀️🤣
[10/27/22, 4:50:28 PM] Gary Teh: I forgive myself!! 🤣
[10/27/22, 4:50:57 PM] Gary Teh: Hoping offline for the day. Great reminder 🙂

What are your thoughts for the upcoming week? 

Bullish?

Bearish?

[10/28/22, 8:25:16 AM] Peter Peng: It will jump back up, I know a bunch of people that need VR strapped to their heads at all time 🤣
[10/28/22, 9:52:55 AM] Gary Teh: Cool!  Thanks for surfacing this!  Your governance voting weightage in our DAO just went up 😎🤣
[10/28/22, 9:54:00 AM] Peter Peng: You need to write a smart contract for that!
[10/28/22, 9:55:31 AM] Gary Teh: Chatting with Michael about it. It’s a really manual process right now 🤔
[10/28/22, 8:09:27 PM] Gary Teh: @14152032783 I just rolled into town

@17755088150 is going to be emceeing at this event over the weekend 

https://nftsanfrancisco.xyz/our-agenda/

If u are keen we could meet there 🙂
[10/29/22, 1:25:10 AM] Sarah H.: The part of the event I will be working is Monday. I could meet up Sunday morning early afternoon
[10/29/22, 5:04:49 AM] Francois renet: Is there an online way to participate??
[10/29/22, 6:54:05 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! Let’s do that! 🙂
[10/29/22, 7:05:03 AM] Jonathan: That’s a great offer @14152032783

[10/29/22, 7:28:27 AM] Gary Teh: I already promised to be on that panel. 🙂

Will also be giving a keynote at this upcoming conference in Germany online, thanks to @491736386942, with the latest learnings acquired observing how the TrueSight dAo network evolved over the past few months 🙂

[10/30/22, 12:07:19 AM] Gary Teh: Aptos surfaced three times independently today, and once again it was @48606646246 that started the trend. It was soon followed by two folks from the network that @17755088150  introduced today in SF.

[10/30/22, 12:48:23 PM] Tres Garcia: Not a fan. Very little room for upward movement vs BTC
[10/30/22, 12:59:51 PM] Aga - DAOist: What timeframe are you talking about? 🤔
[10/30/22, 1:16:56 PM] Gary Teh: I was laughing my ass off the whole. Spot on thinking 🤣
[10/30/22, 1:44:30 PM] Tres Garcia: 2 to 3 years. 
Would rather buy something else.
[10/30/22, 1:45:06 PM] Tres Garcia: Re-evaluate during the next halving in 2024 / 2025
[10/30/22, 1:47:50 PM] Tres Garcia: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos
[10/30/22, 1:51:43 PM] Tres Garcia: 1B market cap and nothing behind it. (No daps or other features yet)

No max supply 

I am 99% sure I am wrong. But I’d rather buy more BTC in this moment vs wait for a new layer 1 to create a community & prove itself. 

So if you have $$$ to burn… why not?
[10/30/22, 1:52:35 PM] Gary Teh: @17755088150 do you remember the name of the other one project that Helena brought up yesterday that rivals Aptos? 🙂

I think both projects will eventually go up. Just like every other alt coin… 
But the path of least resistance is SOL or ETH

[10/30/22, 2:07:02 PM] Gary Teh: What are your thoughts about Polygon? @491736386942 mentioned they have been really successful with their consumer enterprise business outreach
[10/30/22, 2:08:29 PM] Tres Garcia: I have Polygon (MATIC)
But it’s in my Celsius account… 🥺
[10/30/22, 2:09:03 PM] Tres Garcia: I like it. 
Decent tokenomics . Inflation is not too bad

[10/30/22, 2:09:54 PM] Aga - DAOist: Well, if that is how you research a new project than fine :)

Check how many open job offers they have and who is behind it..

I am pretty sure they will pump this project as soon as we are clear about starting the bull market.
‎[10/30/22, 2:10:17 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎GIF omitted
[10/30/22, 2:11:46 PM] Tres Garcia: Yup. Even safoon & hex will 4x to 10x with the right marketing. 
The trick is to make sure you have a seat 💺 once the music stops.
[10/30/22, 2:12:47 PM] Aga - DAOist: Polygon is in top5 of whales. Big increase of projects working on it now (25k?🤔) so that will indicate increase in use.
[10/30/22, 2:15:58 PM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 we have just observed collective mental immunity in action. The more perspective gets surfaced the more wholistic our view of the subject matter is. The importance is to maintain the space for healthy debate🙂
[10/30/22, 2:16:32 PM] Aga - DAOist: Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣 

Women don't make hazard like guys when investing 😅 I am calm and know when to get out and from what 😁 btw, did I even say I invested? 🤔

[10/30/22, 2:19:36 PM] Gary Teh: That is statistically true. Somehow having the YY pair chromosome yields a temperament that leads to even keeled decision making 🙂
[10/30/22, 2:23:40 PM] Aga - DAOist: Women don't need to show off with their % made 😅 they also rather do it with different intention than ego to prove themselves 🤔 sorry guys, but that is the statistics 🤣
[10/30/22, 2:25:13 PM] Aga - DAOist: That is funny because people say that women are more emotional yet in crypto investments I see that guys easier follow emotions than women 🤔
[10/30/22, 2:26:25 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. Let’s see if we can surface more insights about the few projects we have surfaced 

That way we could take the insights away and personally make our decisions in terms of portfolio allocation 🙂
[10/30/22, 2:27:29 PM] Gary Teh: So we are chatting 

Pair 1) APTOS and SUI combo 

Pair 2) SOL, ETH, Polygon
[10/30/22, 2:27:54 PM] Aga - DAOist: Yeah.. we will talk in 3 years how everyone made it 😅
[10/30/22, 2:29:01 PM] Gary Teh: The outcome of Pair 2 discussion from my perspective is impactful as that determine the prioritization of cross chain engineering efforts regarding our governance tokens 🙂
[10/30/22, 2:30:40 PM] Gary Teh: Right now our governance tokens are on the Solana chain which has the AMM mechanism in place


I do know that there is probably more liquidity on the ETH chain than the POLY chain. Poly chain is gaining a lot of traction commercial partnership wise
[10/30/22, 2:30:57 PM] Gary Teh: This is what I am deliberating about
[10/30/22, 2:31:57 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding pair one, from yesterdays fact finding session, it seems both teams have former Libra engineers working on them
[10/30/22, 2:33:15 PM] Aga - DAOist: Wait a sec, I saw some video with a developer today
[10/30/22, 2:34:02 PM] Aga - DAOist: https://youtu.be/BoliqJwiLgw
[10/30/22, 2:37:45 PM] Gary Teh: This becomes especially important now that I sense DEFI based monetization will come into play seeing how Cypher defense is panning out 

We will probably have to decide which chain we collect subscription payment on for some of the premium services 

We will be having a solution brain storming session next week 

If you are keen to stay updated please join this chatroom. 

Hopefully we can publish the private video recording of that discussion session in that chatroom once it is done so that interested folks can view them 🙂

[10/30/22, 2:58:45 PM] Gary Teh: There is a term for this in thd book lean startup. It’s called acquiring a marquee user
[10/30/22, 3:00:57 PM] Gary Teh: We will technically be employing the same strategy for cypher defense.

LOØP social utilized the same strategy to ballon their base from 0 to 1.5 million in three months using the same approach. 

Nowadays folks just calm it influencer marketing 🤣

I was truly impressed by the work he has done helping address the homeless problem in Oakland 

His insight will be very valuable additions to our efforts in Agrihood 

Please do join the Agrihood channel if you would like to find out more about updates from his work as well as those by others in the area of economic inclusiveness and food security 🙂🙏

[10/31/22, 4:58:45 AM] Garis Pang: In years to come, humans will be installed with chip, once personal credits run out, system automatically put the person to sleep, as part of the critical measure to control the global population. 💸🌎⚰️💀
[10/31/22, 5:05:04 AM] Francois renet: Wow! That is scary!!
[10/31/22, 5:10:14 AM] Garis Pang: In fact is not, save the trouble of suicidal 🤣
[10/31/22, 5:19:47 AM] Francois renet: Indeed...
[10/31/22, 6:05:49 AM] Jonathan: In shenzhen if you want to be able to get in taxi, shopping center or even your own apartment building you must be able to show a Covid test result within 24 hours. Now pretty much every apartment building has testing in it. If you don’t get tested within two days, they will call you

[10/31/22, 6:10:30 AM] Jonathan: Shenzhen seems to be the only place in China that does daily testing and they say because it is the only city rich enough. 20 million tests a day, every day, let’s say 20 cents per test. So 4 million dollars a day x 365 more than a billion dollars a year on testing. Guess it’s not so much. Not sure if this useful but just thought it may be interesting to those not here
[10/31/22, 10:30:16 AM] Gary Teh: Or maybe just do this??

[10/31/22, 12:33:08 PM] Jakob/Jascha Martschenko: he is bringing more devs in the space then everyone else in my opinion and empowers them to try out their usecase/problemsolving/idea fast and easy instead of learning for years all the different infrastructures and how to build on them.

[11/1/22, 12:18:29 AM] Marta: Hello everyone, I had the pleasure to talk to Gary about True Sight DAO's story and based on that I wrote an article about True Sight DAO 😁 Enjoy! https://medium.com/ufostart/true-sight-dao-who-are-they-and-what-they-learned-growing-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-a5affe5f3bf3

[11/1/22, 10:16:31 AM] Neil Daud Maxwell: Love this idea, I have been identifying fear based beliefs to let them go as we. Most of them we aren’t aware of until we catch ourselves feeling bad and we ask, “what must I have to believe about myself in order to feel this way right now?”
Also most of what you think is not your own thought forms… unless you do nothing a lot 😂🚀✌️

There is so much passionate amongst all the folks here. Feels more interesting to just be a nobody listen to them share their passion and then figure out how to help them with their stuff by connecting them with the right people in the network 🤔🤣

[11/2/22, 3:44:31 PM] Gary Teh: 🤷‍♂️
[11/2/22, 3:45:11 PM] Gary Teh: So far seems metaverse creators I spoke with here at the conference are defaulting to decentraland for their metaverse needs
[11/2/22, 3:45:14 PM] Francois renet: wondering how Musk is going to use Twitter to go after Insta. We know it's coming!
[11/2/22, 3:45:51 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking a few days ago that Doge coin might become the default currency on Twitter
[11/2/22, 3:46:25 PM] Gary Teh: Reddit has already tokenized their coins and launched NFTs
[11/2/22, 3:46:29 PM] Francois renet: still not a good option i don't think. Engagement is beyond dismal! Could it be that my generation is trying to shove our vision for the Metaverse down the wrong throats?
[11/2/22, 3:46:33 PM] Dan: Could definitely see this happening. Interesting thought!
[11/2/22, 3:47:15 PM] Gary Teh: It’s starting to feel like all these mega walled gardens are evolving to become their own nation/network states
[11/2/22, 3:47:23 PM] Francois renet: Slight hint at it yesterday with some posts by Musk. But would it attract the attention of regulators who already have Musk in crosshairs?
[11/2/22, 3:47:40 PM] Gary Teh: It’s might!! 🤣
[11/2/22, 3:48:20 PM] Francois renet: for sure! A test for our intelligence (or lack thereof?) as humans!
[11/2/22, 3:50:19 PM] Gary Teh: In a lot of ways, Elon’s reminds me of trump 

The only difference is one bought Twitter while the other got booted by Twitter
[11/2/22, 3:51:06 PM] Francois renet: that's about to be changed real soon!!

[11/2/22, 3:55:20 PM] Arti - Berkeley: That, is a very depressing prediction 🫠
‎[11/2/22, 3:56:10 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[11/2/22, 3:56:20 PM] Dan: Very true. It’s getting a little wild. How do you feel Twitter should respond?
[11/2/22, 3:57:43 PM] Gary Teh: Twitter might end up becoming a DAO 🤔
[11/2/22, 3:58:01 PM] Francois renet: Twitter users are responding already. But more because of the new monetization. Or difficulty thereof. Lots of work for little reward. I think advertisers will
Also leave. The Ye effect.
[11/2/22, 3:58:27 PM] Francois renet: DAO is actually the perfect social media model
[11/2/22, 3:59:14 PM] Dan: I like this idea. Would be interesting to see executed
[11/2/22, 4:00:00 PM] Gary Teh: Once their ai gets open sourced I foresee a lot of pull request by developers instead in solving the problem

[11/5/22, 1:18:41 AM] Gary Teh: I suddenly recalled really good memorable movies always have one or two scenes that are meme worthy and their lines easily recycled in almost any social situations you might encounter on a day to day

It’s like they are almost begging to be made into an NFT collection. 

Also they are a whole slew of copyright infringement just waiting to happen if they ever get minted 🤦‍♂️🤣

they match really well with @6594897484  definition of 无聊 (pointless) and entertaining at the same time 

Since it’s free to mint on polygon I wonder what would happen if we just pulled up the usual ten that have circulating around like a virus back in Edmodo as well as amongst the rest of the Bay Area network for the past decade that folks there commonly term the “Garyism” collection and minted those??  🤔🤣
[11/5/22, 1:40:57 AM] Gary Teh: Actually nothing preventing us from minting all those hilarious nonsense that ever transpired in this network 

I recall the time when me, @41799155602 and @971565972337 were looking at the tokenomic diagram that me and @41799155602 came up with late at night for Earn.Games and @971565972337 of all things came up with the most politically incorrect term to label it. 

And then @41798496023  @381616396462 and @381628102423 came into the dining room later and were probably thinking WTF was going on when they saw the three us standing in a circle engaged in some mystic BS 🤣
[11/5/22, 1:48:55 AM] Gary Teh: And also after me and @41799155602 returned back  to Dubai and were showing the diagram of the tokenomics to @601112883373 and @971585668399  

Saying it was interesting to observe their expression. Was probably an understatement. 🤔🤣

[11/5/22, 2:11:46 AM] Gary Teh: If there is a decentralized social network it would probably feel like that. Various tribe members would just periodically go mint some sh*t (NFT) on the blockchain is for fun. 

Much like how I would assume cavemen would go into the cave and do some cave painting from time to time 🤔

[11/5/22, 2:53:08 AM] Gary Teh: My sense is a lot of the prevalent psychological issues we are observing right now around us is that the current structure of our environment has pushed us so far away from our tribal roots. 

Just go pay a visit to the zoo this weekend and take a look at the animals especially the ones really used to roaming in wide open lands 

See how lifeless they looking being caged… that kind of reminds me of us

[11/5/22, 4:42:13 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Coming out with the EG tokenomics has been a challenging exercise. We are basing the functionality of the whole platform on that exercise. The underlying take away from that exercise is that in every web3 project one must account and identify for all the stakeholders: Types of engagement, value generation loops, retention models.

Providing a clear ontology is essential if you want your web3 project to withstand the test of time and go beyond an aggressive marketing push or a hype…

During his birthday private dinner Jerry was thinking through the route I did overland ever since dropping out of Edmodo 

This was what he said 

The father (from the extreme west), the son (to the extreme east) and the Holy Spirit (the arctic), amen (soon Antarctic)

The only place left is outer space 🤣

[11/5/22, 11:05:41 PM] Gary Teh: In terms of user base penetration 

Facebook 1.9 billion DAU
Twitter 160 million DAU

Considering the folks most likely to marginally benefit from the access to financing, it’s really the folks from territories like Africa that will be expecting some really huge impact after understanding the lay of the land there from @971561302188. 

During my last physical survey there that is also where Facebook have outsized market penetration with apps like WhatsApp 

Now that Facebook has started shifting WhatsApp towards web3 and it’s slowly becoming obvious actual DeFi financing will soon be made available to that region I am really curious what would happen with projects like EcoVerse21 which are naturally position to ride that trend 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21  

Seen from this angle Facebook will probably be more impactful than Twitter 

Had SEC not blocked Libra my sense we would probably have already started seeing some really obvious trends in those by now 

I have a hunch I might end up spending alot of time in Tanzania next year 🤔

[11/6/22, 11:27:41 AM] Aga - DAOist: I see couple of matters mixed up in general on different media, doctrines, religions etc.. and suddenly makes sense why the narrative is this way.. kind of preserving the process and the level of knowlegde that one can get on different plane to complete it properly and then advance.. 🤔
[11/6/22, 1:12:46 PM] Gary Teh: Another theme that surfaced with @48606646246  this morning is "space" is probably a better label than "projects" for some of the stuff that exist in our network. 

Project by default assumes very directed activities with some form of agenda while space can literally mean just a space. 

A garden is a space, a meditation hall is a space and dojo is also a space. The main different between a dojo compared to the garden and the meditation hall is there is an expectation that we might observe some activities in the dojo while non-activity is probably the default in the garden and the meditation hall.
[11/6/22, 1:14:43 PM] Gary Teh: I think what would be interesting would be to periodically surface articles we come across out there in the wild west web for discussion here in this space so that we can all gain wider perspective on the matter.
[11/6/22, 1:15:59 PM] Gary Teh: This for example has been a great share by @48606646246  🙂🙌

[11/6/22, 7:38:58 PM] Gary Teh: Just scratch it!! 🤣
[11/6/22, 8:34:54 PM] Gary Teh: I think the thing I like about the "space" is its indestructible quality. You can fill up, empty it, blow up a nuclear bomb in it. But unless space time itself collapses due to some unforeseen quantum event, a "space" can technically never be destroyed.
[11/6/22, 8:44:59 PM] Peter Peng: What about a blackhole?
[11/6/22, 9:42:17 PM] Gary Teh: Interesting… what if a space got sucked into a black hole?? Would it still technically exists? 🤔🤯

It’s definitely a much better alternative than fentanyl
[11/6/22, 10:28:56 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah it was much cooler, almost rave like. My friends and I would just turn on a black light and glow sticks. Then we would walk around outside and it would give me extra sensory perception (ESP) like how the natives used it when they went hunting in the dark. I felt like a nocturnal animal.
[11/6/22, 10:37:20 PM] Gary Teh: Lol! Really? 

Never had that experience. You must have been consuming a different strand 

About the strongest experience I had was being able to get “myself” out of the way to see new connections between different themes/trends I have collected so far and were originally missed due to preconceived biases. 

Some of the conceptual ideas that were experimented in the DAO’s structuring came from the 4 weekends of micro dosing last year just before the evolution down the path of DAO began

It’s like being temporarily granted “mind reading” abilities 

Every single movement of a subject and their corresponding emotional impulses just become so apparent like an open book 🤯
[11/6/22, 10:51:24 PM] Peter Peng: Hahaha I just had a flashback. I remember I would look at the stars, and they would fall out of the sky 🌌
[11/6/22, 10:53:02 PM] Gary Teh: That was the experience I had when in Germany camping with the scouts back in 2008 after traversing the Silk Road overland 

The moon was literally in my face and when I was walking back to my tent, it felt I was perpetually walking on the same spot 🤯
[11/6/22, 10:53:31 PM] Peter Peng: Yes totally understand. I could also fine tune my mind to hit the “luck frequency” if I meditated while the dealer was dealing
[11/6/22, 10:54:19 PM] Peter Peng: Amazing! Unleashes creativity
[11/6/22, 10:55:51 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! 

I on the other hand got so “disgusted” with seeing everybody so “naked” I walked off into the desert and stayed there until everything wore off 🤣

It’s like the mirror neurons kicked into over drive
[11/6/22, 10:57:15 PM] Peter Peng: As an experienced psychonaut, I just learned how to embrace it
[11/6/22, 10:58:51 PM] Peter Peng: When I’m DC I now go to the clubs with my friends and we vape DMT while popping bottles of champagne 🍾 😂

[11/6/22, 11:00:10 PM] Peter Peng: Like learning all the secrets of the universe
[11/6/22, 11:00:21 PM] Peter Peng: The mystical
[11/6/22, 11:01:44 PM] Peter Peng: Basically got a software update
[11/6/22, 11:02:47 PM] Peter Peng: Drugs don’t do anything to me anymore
[11/6/22, 11:05:35 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Got it 

Reminds me some of the writings of Haquin the zen master 

“
Before I started my path to satori, rice tasted normal and daily chores are wretched 

On my path to satori, I saw all sorts of mystic beast and deities

After penetrating beyond satori, rice tasted normal and daily chores are still equally wretched
”

Seems practitioners on the path were instructed to ignore all the distractions they might encounter on their path towards satori. Some even described as “magical” powers. I wonder if these folks were utilizing psychedelic of some sort back in the days 🤔
[11/6/22, 11:05:56 PM] Peter Peng: Meditation allows me to reach the state of mind I want
[11/6/22, 11:08:54 PM] Peter Peng: I totally understand this. At some point you learn that there is only so much you can learn. Also, relying on drugs can also limit your spiritual progress as a substance is finite but the multiverse / universe is infinite
[11/6/22, 11:13:42 PM] Gary Teh: Yup just like most things, after a while it hits the marginal utility. At which point, probably makes sense to set it aside and move on to something else.
[11/6/22, 11:13:56 PM] Peter Peng: Magic is heavily practiced in DC, the heart of American Politics. This is where shadow politics come into play.
[11/6/22, 11:19:02 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me, perhaps its a seasonal thing like all the other bounties nature offer. 

Salad during spring, nuts and berries during autumn. Mushrooms seem to flourish during the tail end of autumn. Winter when every time is at rest seems like a good time to go into a contemplative mode and mushrooms seems natural complements to such activities
[11/6/22, 11:20:29 PM] Peter Peng: The legalization of recreational drugs will simply lead to the domestication of human beings
[11/6/22, 11:23:44 PM] Peter Peng: Well you still have free will
[11/6/22, 11:25:29 PM] Peter Peng: I have a new girlfriend, she domesticates me. You can escape domestication Gary… just learn to embrace it.

[11/6/22, 11:38:54 PM] Gary Teh: In fact, I see the raccoon that is my neighbor for the night as having equal rights to the space that I am occupying right now too 🤩
[11/6/22, 11:41:21 PM] Peter Peng: Awesome! It’s god’s way of hanging with you
[11/6/22, 11:46:10 PM] Gary Teh: I was sharing with @14155086888  yesterday, I might be one person in the middle of nowhere a lot times. But somehow there is always company available in one form or another

[11/7/22, 9:24:09 AM] Gary Teh: These influencers are spreading FUD about other NFT projects to attract new followers

Then they sell their own NFTs

Once those are done, new accounts are created to spread FUD about those NFTs to attract new followers to sell new sets of NFTs

And the cycle continues
[11/7/22, 9:37:05 AM] Gary Teh: Just observed another Synchronicity 🤔

Andrew was mentioning the magic Eden hackerthon that’s ongoing right now with a total prize pool of USD250K

Doing it remotely
[11/7/22, 9:56:22 AM] Gary Teh: Might be 🙂

Let me ask

These are updated slides I will be using 🙂
[11/7/22, 12:46:42 PM] Francois renet: Wow! how do you put a stop to THAT??
[11/7/22, 12:49:11 PM] Francois renet: i just went on their website, and it says that the event was on the 7th, ie: today??
[11/7/22, 12:51:15 PM] Francois renet: Actually it's a different graphic, but the event is tomorrow. However online purchase to participate is closed!
[11/7/22, 12:52:34 PM] Dan: Think that’s a complex issue. These practices prey upon people who are new to the space. Educating is one way to address. Curious if anyone has other possible solutions
[11/7/22, 12:54:33 PM] Francois renet: so here is a nice crossover with the Cypher Defense Group, right? Part education/part defense for all newbies in the space. Don't see why the major NFT platforms wouldn't want to partner? They all have a pretty bad rep to overcome!
[11/7/22, 1:21:37 PM] Gary Teh: Yup! 

Was chatting with @16468233438 just now over coffee. 

Getting people to pay for impersonation protection or companies to pay for trade mark infringement protection is probably going to be a hard sell. 

We might just end up offering the chrome extension for free and allowing users to buy insurance for their wallets in case those got hacked
[11/7/22, 1:24:00 PM] Francois renet: Still believe offering service to "certify" as trusted source is a good way to go. And NFT buyers - across the board - could use protection against scams. I guess an advisory service with recommendations as to "what to buy" is still too early?

It’s use case complete for flagging suspicious domains to prevent connecting of unsuspecting wallets 

Holding off on further development now till we get more market validation on the monetization side

[11/8/22, 4:47:08 AM] Gary Teh: @4915209984105 hopefully the attendees of the conference today would get inspired on how they could replicate the same model we have been using to solve other social problems surfaced in their own vicinity.

I heard from @16504369509 that they are in the process of doing the same for the Oakland homeless problem via a gamified process. 🙂🙏

[11/8/22, 7:20:12 AM] Tres Garcia: It’s a scam advertising a Elon and Crypto in a phishing scheme. You send them BTC and they match the amount. Only you can’t withdraw and they don’t send you BTC back.

YouTube was running the adds daily back in 2020-2021. They have died down a bit. But the scammers had a good run
[11/8/22, 7:20:45 AM] Tres Garcia: Guess YouTube didn’t care as long as they were making ad rev

I wonder if there’s a class action waiting as a response
[11/8/22, 7:56:04 AM] Gary Teh: Strange why is Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Cathie wood on the same YouTube video??
[11/8/22, 9:47:49 AM] Dan: Love seeing the model applied for housing. Looking forward to exploring different actions to maximize impact in collaboration💚

[11/9/22, 4:52:09 AM] Gary Teh: I was reading through the software architecture of Mastodon and this thought occurred to me 

Actually why hasn’t anyone setup a mastodon version of metaverse where someone could just bring their server online and make their land available as part of this ever evolving and shifting immersive environment. 

When you walk to the very edge of the land hosted on someone’s server you enter into the land hosted by someone else’s server 

That would really create a very decentralized metaverse as opposed to current walled garden version all hosted on one company’s cluster 

When the host brings his/her server offline, a user will just walk into the next adjacent metaverse environment hosted by another person instead 

It makes more sense than buying pseudo land on someone else’s server which is stupid and only creates artificial scarcity

[11/9/22, 1:45:11 PM] Aga - DAOist: Still too much more to gain from fear 🤔 if I was them with their mindset I would continue to scare people more 😅
[11/9/22, 1:46:46 PM] Francois renet: only because the whales will manipulate it!
[11/9/22, 1:46:51 PM] Dan: We’re currently just setup on Signal with our core team. Educating them on the benefits of exploring Web3 with our project at the moment. Hope to setup a WhatsApp community channel where we can all collaborate soon. 

There’s a city funded housing project that’s being rushed through without much conversation and irritating unhoused community members. That’s where our team’s focus has been this week. Nice motivator to create a more sustainable model focused on healing and job training💚🌏✨
[11/9/22, 1:46:55 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, but at what cost to the overall ecosystem?
[11/9/22, 1:47:42 PM] Peter Peng: The whales are manipulating it, which is why is whale hunting season 🔥🔥🔥🐳
[11/9/22, 1:47:53 PM] Tres Garcia: Cost = EVERYTHING....
[11/9/22, 1:47:55 PM] Aga - DAOist: What cost do you mean?

[11/9/22, 1:48:31 PM] Peter Peng: From a technological innovation standpoint
[11/9/22, 1:50:00 PM] Francois renet: i know of at least two 4 and 6 Billion $ deals that were concluded privately via a bank in Zurich two months ago!
[11/9/22, 1:51:07 PM] Aga - DAOist: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean... 

For me it is a clear manipulation game.. They will publish soon couple of things to turn the market up with all the newbies so nobody will care anymore 🤷‍♀️ but for the moment they will hunt as much as possible for the lowest prices..
[11/9/22, 1:53:08 PM] Peter Peng: It should just keep going up steady and slowly, you’ll see that happen once AI takes over the blockchain
[11/9/22, 1:53:54 PM] Peter Peng: It will be as stable as an index fund lol
[11/9/22, 1:55:26 PM] Aga - DAOist: You think AI isn't involved yet in blochchain transactions? 😅

 the whole "fun" is that it isn't stable 🤣
[11/9/22, 1:56:08 PM] Peter Peng: NFTs will become fun
[11/9/22, 1:58:15 PM] Aga - DAOist: Depends which type of nfts you mean 😅 I think there was enough of fun already to assume that this chapter of fun digitals with no utility is over like most ICOs.. 😅
[11/9/22, 1:58:43 PM] Peter Peng: No, I still think it’s controlled by whales 🐳
[11/9/22, 1:59:50 PM] Peter Peng: I think Metaverse NFTs will be fun
[11/9/22, 2:00:21 PM] Aga - DAOist: Which control the AI 🤣
[11/9/22, 2:01:14 PM] Peter Peng: Which is why it’s whale hunting season 🔥
[11/9/22, 2:01:17 PM] Peter Peng: 💀

[11/9/22, 2:25:45 PM] Peter Peng: This is how you regulate crypto
[11/9/22, 2:26:06 PM] Gary Teh: Well, from my perspective NFTs are already becoming so fun it’s starting to stink like rotten radish… pun absolutely intended 🤣

[11/9/22, 2:31:41 PM] Tres Garcia: Shame really…. He was technically doing a public service…. Robbing drug dealers to boost the economy. Better than printing money….
[11/9/22, 2:32:47 PM] Peter Peng: US Government are the biggest drug dealers
[11/9/22, 2:33:04 PM] Peter Peng: They created the dark web
[11/9/22, 2:34:14 PM] Peter Peng: The entire world financial system would implode without the drug trade, it’s recession proof

[11/9/22, 2:37:00 PM] Tres Garcia: Nah. Only 1% of Global GDP
Money laundering is more lucrative vs drug trade

[11/9/22, 2:41:24 PM] Tres Garcia: Good listen. Really opened my mind to what’s coming and caused me to not look back on a previous job with a large bank
[11/9/22, 2:41:37 PM] Tres Garcia: Couldn’t agree more
[11/9/22, 2:41:46 PM] Gary Teh: That is what one of my projects ended up being 

https://GetData.IO 

Folks are using it to scavenge data from the web to feed their AI. Much like how https://TrueSight.me is utilizing that same infrastructure to feed Edgar the AI
[11/9/22, 2:42:09 PM] Gary Teh: I read this book before! It’s da best!!
[11/9/22, 2:45:13 PM] Aga - DAOist: What about Solana situation guys?
‎[11/9/22, 2:46:01 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[11/9/22, 2:47:28 PM] Peter Peng: No one has an edge, because the Ghost in the machine overpowers it. 🤭
[11/9/22, 2:47:34 PM] Gary Teh: I guess folks are still using it. It’s kind of hard to migrate away from an infrastructure once integrated 

I am imagining if we wanted to migrate our tokens from Solana over to polygon the entire community will need to go through a migration process. 

I would imagine other projects will have to go through the same painful process
[11/9/22, 2:47:36 PM] Tres Garcia: Biden puled the plug on China? Or the US?

[11/9/22, 2:57:16 PM] Peter Peng: They are doing it on purpose
[11/9/22, 2:58:11 PM] Aga - DAOist: So you don't believe that projects in the ecosystem will keep it going like this guy: https://youtu.be/MXrPSUU1448
[11/9/22, 2:59:57 PM] Gary Teh: I doubt. They got some pretty nice utility already baked into the chain itself 🤷‍♂️

Maybe the price of the coin will get impacted but the projects will just continue business as usual 

In fact I would it is much better for the projects now that gas fee has became even cheaper!!
[11/9/22, 3:01:47 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/9/22, 3:02:46 PM] Peter Peng: I actually blame the election more than FTX
[11/9/22, 3:03:46 PM] Gary Teh: I know of developer folks that are still hating on solidity for EVM because it is not fundamental enough like Rust is for Solana for programming 

solidity is actually a DSL that is interpreted by the EVM engine while Rust is actually a full blown language in and of itself 

The only thing I hate about Solana is it’s shitty documentation
‎[11/9/22, 3:04:01 PM] Gary Teh: ‎GIF omitted
[11/9/22, 3:04:35 PM] Peter Peng: Solana runs on the LLVM so it’s good for those old school Java devs
[11/9/22, 3:05:36 PM] Peter Peng: The EVM is a completely new animal which is why it’s faster
[11/9/22, 3:05:44 PM] Peter Peng: I mean slower
[11/9/22, 3:05:48 PM] Peter Peng: Not faster
[11/9/22, 3:05:53 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah and there are a lot of those from Web2 that are waiting to onboard 

Like Ambarish (my ex-VPe) who is in love with compiles languages like Java

And Vibhu (my ex-CEO) who was nicely surprised when I told him Solana uses Rust
[11/9/22, 3:06:57 PM] Peter Peng: It’s not bad, but it’s not as cool as EVM
[11/9/22, 3:07:40 PM] Gary Teh: True. The EVM does have first mover advantage in terms of the developer ecosystem
[11/9/22, 3:08:42 PM] Peter Peng: The world is multi chain
[11/9/22, 3:08:50 PM] Gary Teh: And all the newer generation front end folks who grew up on ReactJs are in love with solidity
[11/9/22, 3:09:06 PM] Gary Teh: Due to its similarity with JavaScript
[11/9/22, 3:09:11 PM] Peter Peng: So I’m fine, its just preference

[11/9/22, 5:09:45 PM] Gary Teh: Didn't have time to transfer my cash over from Ameritrade. Market is moving too fast! 🤣
[11/9/22, 5:15:29 PM] Gary Teh: I am sensing despite the massive layoffs in the tech space in the big tech space, some sectors like Web3 is still having a severe shortfall of experienced engineers given all the unsolicited incoming recruitment offers as well as what I heard shared by the fellow panelist during the conference that @4915209984105 and @491736386942 were at. 

I believe Web3 is coming at us right now like a bullet train hidden I. The fog of war 🤔
[11/9/22, 5:15:31 PM] Peter Peng: Ameritrade should support Bitcoin
[11/9/22, 5:15:46 PM] Gary Teh: Really?? Dang!! Time to do a portfolio rebalance
[11/9/22, 5:16:20 PM] Gary Teh: Which is the stock ticker??

Am actually quite glad Meta is shifting WhatsApp towards Web3. This means more API integration possibility will get open up soon.
[11/9/22, 5:53:28 PM] Gary Teh: Personally from my perspective, it’s a really interesting model. 

If it proves to work then we might have found a way around the winner takes all uneven wealth distribution dynamics of network effects heavy tech companies which is driving a lot of the homeless problem we are seeing right now 🤷‍♂️
[11/9/22, 5:54:36 PM] Gary Teh: If it doesn’t then it was at least a fun experiment 🤣

[11/9/22, 8:33:05 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of giving a shit, I was having dinner just now at the local izakaya in sf when the waitress tried to make small talk after seeing me here for the second evening in a row 

So here was how it went

She said “so you living in this area or working in this area”

Me “I am actually homeless living out of my car camped out along the beach… big smile 🤩”

Her response… a very awkward pause… “ok let me go grab your check” 

🤣

[11/9/22, 9:13:37 PM] Peter Peng: The fact that Elon Musk wants to “nuke Mars” will start an arms race… also his helping of Donald Trump is something to question. Especially after Trump stole all of those classified nuclear documents.

[11/9/22, 10:31:42 PM] Peter Peng: We should occupy with robots and AI this time to help us reduce labor costs.
[11/9/22, 10:32:17 PM] Peter Peng: But first need to secure everything on the blockchain.

[11/9/22, 11:05:33 PM] Peter Peng: I’m pretty sure CZ just pulled that move to get access to the books in order to publicly shame SBF for snitching to regulators.
[11/9/22, 11:06:26 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: May be
[11/9/22, 11:06:45 PM] Peter Peng: It was too quick and orchestrated
[11/9/22, 11:09:35 PM] Peter Peng: Now Binance has the real dirt on FTX and can turn divert attention away from itself onto FTX
[11/9/22, 11:17:08 PM] Peter Peng: SBF was trying to point fingers to CZ first, but it backfired on him.
[11/9/22, 11:18:17 PM] Peter Peng: Basically he was a little fake bitch trying to parade around like some white knight of the crypto industry

[11/12/22, 1:09:16 PM] Gary Teh: Hey folks as you all know a bunch of us have been working on rolling out the cypher defense project to help protect all network members against scams and phishing attacks in the web3 space. 

We are about to roll out the solution (which comes in the form of a chrome extension)

There are a bunch of actions that members can engage via the chrome extension to earn governance tokens once its rolled out. 

These actions are described here on this page. It is also the page that will be shown to all users when they first install Cypher defense. 
https://truesight.me/dao/chrome_installed
[11/12/22, 1:10:10 PM] Aga - DAOist: https://youtu.be/LWq77i9mIRE
[11/12/22, 1:10:41 PM] Gary Teh: To facilitate ease for network members to determine how much governance tokens to be granted for each action, we have created a Google form that members in this channel can now go vote. 

The weighted average of each item for voting will automatically be incorporated into the system. Please do go submit your vote there. Each person can only vote once. However you can modify your vote as and when you please.

BUT with it connected to the rest of the eco system, I am wondering how much of the original $13B was held by FTX and associates. 

I am staying to my original thesis that SOL sould be a % of ETH.
[11/12/22, 1:13:03 PM] Peter Peng: I say, let Solana do what they want.

[11/12/22, 1:16:18 PM] Peter Peng: Let’s just launch our own stable coin backed by the Federal Reserve
[11/12/22, 1:16:31 PM] Peter Peng: Fed Coin
[11/12/22, 1:17:04 PM] Peter Peng: I’ll break UST like a fucking piggy bank
[11/12/22, 1:17:26 PM] Gary Teh: Why not a coin for new President? 

And the stability of the coins valuation be pegged to how sane he/she is 🤣

[11/12/22, 1:18:06 PM] Dan: Already being lined up. Pelosi teased a digital dollar for stimulus distribution at the start of Covid 🤮
[11/12/22, 1:18:08 PM] Peter Peng: I’m the craziest
[11/12/22, 1:18:09 PM] Aga - DAOist: On the other side... let's face the truth that our banking system and all currencies work the same way 🤣 "show your reserve" 😅

[11/12/22, 1:28:20 PM] Gary Teh: But which one do you like better? Grade A Heroine or Grade A cocaine?
[11/12/22, 1:28:44 PM] Peter Peng: Cocaine baby
[11/12/22, 1:29:01 PM] Peter Peng: Decriminalize it
[11/12/22, 1:30:39 PM] Peter Peng: After this Covid lockdown we need to get the party started and everyone back in the office, sniffing lines and building Web3
[11/12/22, 1:31:04 PM] Peter Peng: This is the only way I know how to get everyone back in office
[11/12/22, 1:31:11 PM] Peter Peng: Like the 80’s
[11/12/22, 1:31:46 PM] Aga - DAOist: Why is is in TDG tokens and not with a separate tokenomics? 

What people will want to see is the value of such token so I think we should ask people who will be potentially involved in reporting.. 🤔
[11/12/22, 1:31:55 PM] Gary Teh: But why not Quaaludes? Imagine destroying all the cars in the streets while driving under influence? 🤣

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7btKdFOs5w
[11/12/22, 1:32:44 PM] Peter Peng: I think that’s why they banned them lol … I heard they were awesome
[11/12/22, 1:34:15 PM] Gary Teh: Well, It's all running under the same rubric system.

Right now, there is around USD0.003571428571429 backing each governance token that you are all holding

It will get further diluted as more tokens get issued out.
[11/12/22, 1:35:42 PM] Gary Teh: Once subscribers start utilizing the premium portion of the service, we will just sink the profit into the liquidity pool to increase the volume of USD backing the value of each token
[11/12/22, 1:35:52 PM] Gary Teh: There is not premium portion of the service yet
[11/12/22, 1:37:09 PM] Gary Teh: This our DAO's USDT holdings from the liquidity injection early on this year by the folks from the Global DAO Alliance.

[11/12/22, 1:38:05 PM] Peter Peng: What do they feel like?
[11/12/22, 1:38:22 PM] Aga - DAOist: I am not convinced to bind all projects with one token and make them depend on it.. 

And again, I believe that we should first ask our target group and not try to figure out ourselves.. based on their answers we can adjust the estimation.
[11/12/22, 1:38:31 PM] Peter Peng: I’ve only tried Soma, which is a muscle relaxer
[11/12/22, 1:38:31 PM] Gary Teh: No idea! I was only living vicariously through Leonardo Dicaprio
[11/12/22, 1:38:39 PM] Peter Peng: Oh Hahahha
[11/12/22, 1:39:26 PM] Gary Teh: Good point. Let's see what they say. 

Haven't heard anything from them recently. My sense is they probably lost interest and have moved on to something else more urgent 🤣
[11/12/22, 1:40:26 PM] Gary Teh: The mechanism also allows the target audience to submit their estimations and that gets reflected in the tokenomics
[11/12/22, 1:43:17 PM] Aga - DAOist: I am talking about those who are on the market everyday experencing different issues that they could report.. maybe some people involved in DAOs or trading 🤔
[11/12/22, 1:43:43 PM] Gary Teh: I see. 🙂👍
[11/12/22, 2:07:59 PM] Peter Peng: Ever since “FAANG” turned to “MAANG” big tech dominance has dwindled
[11/12/22, 2:21:48 PM] Gary Teh: So what’s next?? 🤩
[11/12/22, 2:22:40 PM] Peter Peng: NFTs and DAOs
[11/12/22, 2:23:35 PM] Peter Peng: But I think Dapps will create the largest Web3 companies
[11/12/22, 2:24:22 PM] Peter Peng: We also need to figure out this FedCoin
[11/12/22, 2:25:18 PM] Peter Peng: I personally think it should be a coin that drives the AI Economy, but I’m biased
[11/12/22, 2:26:32 PM] Peter Peng: It will take control of the World Bank
[11/12/22, 2:26:45 PM] Peter Peng: 🌎
[11/12/22, 2:27:33 PM] Tres Garcia: Technically the FED coin is the DAO. The people vote in elections for representation.
[11/12/22, 2:28:15 PM] Tres Garcia: And just like every other token.... They keep printing. (*Some inflation is higher > Others
[11/12/22, 2:29:16 PM] Peter Peng: My concern is a bunch of DAOs competing
[11/12/22, 2:29:32 PM] Peter Peng: Because I don’t lose 😈
[11/12/22, 2:29:38 PM] Tres Garcia: Competition = Good
Gets rid of the losers
[11/12/22, 2:30:33 PM] Gary Teh: I will probably just end up taking a small position in a lot of these DAOs to spread my financial risk if I was very profit oriented 🤣
[11/12/22, 2:31:27 PM] Gary Teh: But since I am more of Do Nothing kind of person, so will probably head out to the desert!

[11/12/22, 2:54:52 PM] Tres Garcia: Can't prove they were...
[11/12/22, 2:55:09 PM] Peter Peng: Nothing surprises me these days.
[11/12/22, 2:55:09 PM] Tres Garcia: Can't prove they weren't...  🤔
‎[11/12/22, 2:55:32 PM] Gary Teh: ‎GIF omitted
[11/12/22, 2:57:32 PM] Gary Teh: Another approach is to establish a utility token class that is awarded to the contributors of those listed actions specific to the scope of that project 

That is generally how I observe was done by other web3 projects
‎[11/12/22, 3:00:17 PM] Franck Nouyrigat: ‎image omitted
[11/12/22, 3:00:49 PM] Gary Teh: That utility token class ensures up becoming the stable coin portion where the dao makes the spread between the buy and sell

And a portion of the profits from operations get siphoned off to back the governance tokens (periodically paid out in USDC dividends)  and these are awarded to folks who helped build out the project
[11/12/22, 3:01:59 PM] Gary Teh: It just boils down to what is the best way to incentivize all the players in the ecosystem to participate so that the ecosystem can function as a healthy network
[11/12/22, 3:02:44 PM] Gary Teh: So everyone who ends up in Forbes ends up in jail at some point? 🤔🤣
[11/12/22, 3:13:37 PM] Peter Peng: I’ve been to jail before, it’s not that bad 😂
[11/12/22, 3:14:46 PM] Peter Peng: I grew up in Florida, too much debauchary down there
[11/12/22, 3:15:22 PM] Peter Peng: Especially Orlando and Miami
[11/12/22, 3:15:24 PM] Gary Teh: Me too bro!

First time locked in the Xinjiang area of China when being suspected of inciting insurgence amongst the uighurs to rise up against the Chinese government 

Second time in Azerbaijani after the screw up with the letter of invitation 🤣
[11/12/22, 3:16:05 PM] Peter Peng: At least it’s a meal and place to sleep
[11/12/22, 3:16:10 PM] Gary Teh: Had to bribe my way out both times

Thankfully it was before the Fed triggered off massive inflation
[11/12/22, 3:18:38 PM] Peter Peng: Haha nice 👍
[11/12/22, 3:20:16 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure the bribes would be costing a fortune in todays dollars. Might have ended up deciding it was cheaper to just stay in jail and do nothing if it were to happen again in todays environment

[11/12/22, 3:34:50 PM] Peter Peng: Volatile
[11/12/22, 3:34:52 PM] Gary Teh: Ironically Do Nothing stills ends up becoming the default when the bull market comes around as there are too much money chasing after too little of the available resources to do any stuff and key resources become too expensive to do anything 🤣
[11/12/22, 3:35:45 PM] Peter Peng: This is where tokenization of real world assets is key 🔑

[11/13/22, 5:26:45 PM] Peter Peng: Haha I love it
[11/13/22, 5:27:06 PM] Peter Peng: Investors should transfer that $ to crypto
[11/13/22, 5:27:33 PM] Peter Peng: Blockchain is going to take over everything LFG 🚀
[11/13/22, 5:28:00 PM] Gary Teh: Can we make a fake Elon Musk account and then Twitter lose billions as well? 

Wait... Twitter was already losing billions before Elon Musk bought it. 🤣
[11/13/22, 5:28:56 PM] Peter Peng: Haha Elon is already losing billions, we don’t even need to try. He will be the next SBF, just wait. 😎
[11/13/22, 5:30:41 PM] Peter Peng: The collapse of Twitter will be a fall on Biblical proportions
[11/13/22, 5:31:51 PM] Peter Peng: His whole net worth may go to $0

[11/13/22, 5:41:49 PM] Gary Teh: That is Fake News of the highest order!! 

Very profitable. I was literally trading on these kinds of fake news from 2017 all the way till just before the pandemic 🤩
[11/13/22, 5:41:52 PM] Dan: This is all going to likely lead to KYC for verified on Twitter. What are people’s thoughts on that idea?

[11/13/22, 5:43:36 PM] Gary Teh: Well… if you already have signed up on TrueSight.me

You should periodically receive the sell off email from edgar our resident AI

At that point it’s basically your call to figure out where the Fakeness is 😎
[11/13/22, 5:43:43 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why they call it the “Brave Browser”
[11/13/22, 5:44:50 PM] Gary Teh: I have made USD4 so far from the brave browser

I was thinking of replicating that same monetization model for cypher defense just this afternoon 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/cypher
[11/13/22, 5:45:06 PM] Dan: Definitely! I do receive those updates. Generally don’t do any trading myself outside of NFTs
[11/13/22, 5:45:35 PM] Dan: This is true?
[11/13/22, 5:45:57 PM] Gary Teh: If you are sure some symbols are indeed the result of fake news then make a bullish or bearish call. You get awarded TDG governance tokens for making the right calls
[11/13/22, 5:47:02 PM] Peter Peng: With blockchain everything can be monetized
[11/13/22, 5:47:23 PM] Dan: Gonna look into this more. Symbols for stocks specifically?
‎[11/13/22, 5:47:31 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[11/13/22, 5:47:57 PM] Gary Teh: Or even crypto. Crypto symbols generally end in -USD
[11/13/22, 5:48:21 PM] Dan: Got it
[11/13/22, 5:48:23 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure how this relates to anything but maybe the world will become more globalize
[11/13/22, 5:49:38 PM] Gary Teh: I sense it’s becoming more fragmented
[11/13/22, 5:49:55 PM] Peter Peng: The US is a global Petri dish 🧫 for the future… even more so NYC… we are changing the world
[11/13/22, 5:50:33 PM] Peter Peng: It will be slightly uncomfortable but worth seeing the change
[11/13/22, 5:51:06 PM] Peter Peng: Time to automate the government
[11/13/22, 5:53:05 PM] Peter Peng: More unified in the Metaverse yet more fragmented in the real world.
[11/13/22, 5:53:17 PM] Peter Peng: All occurring simultaneously
[11/13/22, 5:53:30 PM] Peter Peng: Reaching quantum status
[11/13/22, 5:54:21 PM] Peter Peng: But again it all depends on perspective
[11/13/22, 5:54:54 PM] Peter Peng: Market down for you may mean market up for me, I think it depends on if you have an abundance mindset or not.

[11/13/22, 6:25:47 PM] Gary Teh: Also quickly realized the other day, the site where Ambarish invited to go hiking was a regular van life enclave facing the park by the bay. It’s right behind Google’s campus in Mountain View

Spent this afternoon hacking in Hacker Dojo (the ashram for hackers in the bay) another crowd funded venue that offers free workspace and coffee for all hackers. 

There is definitely a lot of abundance everywhere if only you know where to look
[11/13/22, 6:30:04 PM] Peter Peng: There have been times this year where I didn’t have much $ to even buy a meal so this is helpful. Money isn’t flowing like it should be so we know there is something wrong with the system.
[11/13/22, 6:30:10 PM] Dan: 100 percent agree! We just need to tune our vision to see it🔮
[11/13/22, 6:31:04 PM] Peter Peng: And I always have a lot of money to burn, so this is definitely strange.
[11/13/22, 6:34:38 PM] Gary Teh: What really stood to me during the 10 day vipassana silent meditation retreat when Geonka gave his regular evening lecture on what Guatama really did was that that dude jail broken his Android OS 🤣

A lot what the experiments I have been doing these past two years really felt like taking a legacy operating system (my lifestyle) and then doing a deep refactor of the way the code is ran to push it to the limits of what the environment can support 

Neo and the rest of the crew in the matrix were technically hackers. They basically jail broke their own Android OS to get out of the system 

I remembered when I was really having a lot of fun when we bought a bunch of Android handset and went about systemically jail breaking them to see where the boundaries were back during the Disconnect.me days

[11/13/22, 6:36:26 PM] Peter Peng: Nice! Is there a way we can create a blockchain cell phone service that’s free?
[11/13/22, 6:36:52 PM] Dan: Mesh network??
[11/13/22, 6:36:54 PM] Peter Peng: Or very inexpensive
[11/13/22, 6:37:24 PM] Peter Peng: Mesh network with edge computing
[11/13/22, 6:37:24 PM] Gary Teh: @17206665895 and @48606646246 been mentioning telepathy 🤔

If we can figure out a minimal viable working model, then we can systematize it
[11/13/22, 6:39:50 PM] Gary Teh: Zero to one is always the hardest (unknown to known)

Scaling from my perspective is just trivial ( one to many)
[11/13/22, 6:39:56 PM] Dan: Love it! If we tap into our natural forces I believe telepathy is real. Like how we can feel someone looking at us. Just more dialed. Would love to learn more
[11/13/22, 6:40:52 PM] Dan: Or are they talking about this… https://medium.com/frank-prempehs-blog/5g-will-help-usher-in-telepathic-communication-e0f488739545

[11/13/22, 6:41:50 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I been testing this hypothesis to validate the trend of increased demand for Asian actors after observing what I did back in Portland. The signal strength seem to be strong 

Just landed my first acting gig in Hollywood. Guess I will be very entertained when I arrive in LA a few weeks from now 🤣
[11/13/22, 6:41:54 PM] Peter Peng: We are all telepathic to some degree but I still feels sub conscious to me… maybe for good reason.
[11/13/22, 6:42:23 PM] Peter Peng: Congrats!
[11/13/22, 6:43:14 PM] Dan: Congrats brother! Wise move to enter that space now. You excited for the role?

[11/13/22, 6:47:32 PM] Peter Peng: I see it now, a hot blonde attorney pours Gary a nice glass of whiskey 🥃. Gary plays an FBI agent in this new role investigating a recent cryptocurrency heist by corrupt local officials in Seattle.
[11/13/22, 6:48:37 PM] Peter Peng: No, you have to act as a straight male in this movie

[11/13/22, 7:06:59 PM] Gary Teh: It was either Mujin for boy (birth name of Genghis Khan) or Mulan for girl. I wanted Mu (木) in the name somewhere since California was the land of the giant sequoia wood 

The entire mum’s side of the family gave a sight of relief when the baby turned out to be a girl. Somehow folks in the US think of Genghis as a mass murderer who committed unimaginable atrocities instead of a hero who freed his land of oppressors and later set the foundation for a dynasty 🤔
[11/13/22, 7:12:20 PM] Gary Teh: that was what inspired TrueSight DAO 

Personally it was never about money. It always been about making sure the system remains stable so that this kid have an adulthood to look forward to 🤩
[11/13/22, 7:18:19 PM] Dan: That’s a nice connection to the sequoia trees 🌳 Also that symbol’s symmetry looks perfect 

My history knowledge could use an upgrade. I sadly hadn’t seen him as the hero yet. Great to learn
[11/13/22, 7:24:03 PM] Gary Teh: Also her dad’s got Yang Wu as his heaven elemental. Figured it would be good to pass some of those over to her

Coincidentally Her heaven elemental is Yang Fire. So having some firewood as fodder is beneficial for her 🤣
[11/13/22, 7:26:43 PM] Gary Teh: The Chinese Hans were doing a whole bunch of fake news campaign back in the days to keep the nomads from uniting

Genghis saw through the bullshit and unified his tribe to cut the BS

Interestingly, the tribe he initially assembled were mainly made up of folks who were exiled from their own tribes. That ended up being a lot of people 

This was Another of those idea that inspired the way TrueSight DAO’s tokenomics was structured

[11/13/22, 7:31:31 PM] Gary Teh: Attila’s incursion into Europe also did help spread the gene in that area of the world 

https://totallyhistory.com/attila-the-hun-vs-genghis-khan/
[11/13/22, 7:34:24 PM] Dan: That’s incredible to learn. Inspiring as well to read that this action is a part of the origin story for TrueSight DAO💚🌏🌱
[11/13/22, 7:35:34 PM] Gary Teh: A journalist did a write up on some parts of it last year

[11/13/22, 7:57:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: Nope US is fracturing the world. One war at a time
[11/13/22, 7:58:23 PM] Peter Peng: You mean Russia?
[11/13/22, 7:58:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: Could I ask where u are located?
[11/13/22, 7:58:48 PM] Peter Peng: USA
[11/13/22, 7:58:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. No wonder
[11/13/22, 7:59:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: The government’s rhetoric is really brainwash working
[11/13/22, 7:59:53 PM] Peter Peng: In America the people run the government
[11/13/22, 8:00:09 PM] Peter Peng: And the people come from all over the world
[11/13/22, 8:00:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: Travel more. And talk to people all over the world like Gary does. U will see many in the world has a different term for the usa
[11/13/22, 8:00:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: United Shit-Stirring Agency
[11/13/22, 8:00:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s what it is known

[11/13/22, 8:04:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Oh trust me. A lot of money is earned through war
[11/13/22, 8:05:16 PM] Peter Peng: Time to release the funds
[11/13/22, 8:05:29 PM] Peter Peng: End Quantitative tightening
[11/13/22, 8:06:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Don’t for one moment think when usa says “10b will be sent to Ukraine for aid” means Ukraine actually receives 10B.
[11/13/22, 8:09:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: 10B is sent to American war manufacturers and equipment suppliers. 

It’s like a massive order sheet for American war business. 

Then whatever is made is sent to Ukraine and the money stays in usa. 

Meanwhile Ukraine will have a debt owed to usa for the 10B worth of goods as liability to be paid after the war for the next generations. 

Usa gains 10b of business for war companies locally. Made in America

And gains 10B worth of debt from Ukraine. 

Instant double on investment
[11/13/22, 8:10:04 PM] Peter Peng: Sometimes war is necessary to prevent the spread of evil.
[11/13/22, 8:10:08 PM] Tres Garcia: Drop in the bucket to Pay off the national debt.
[11/13/22, 8:10:55 PM] Peter Peng: Removing corruption is a priceless thing.
[11/13/22, 8:11:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just like in Iraq I supposed. Bombed Iraq for weapons of mass destruction 

Then many years later. When got exposed with oops there was never a single wmd in the first place. 

Meanwhile the gain is all the Iraq oil business
[11/13/22, 8:11:42 PM] Peter Peng: No one around the world is scared of China or Russia
[11/13/22, 8:12:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: Or it could be intentionally spreading evil. U need to make someone the bad guy to look like the good guy.
[11/13/22, 8:13:24 PM] Peter Peng: America is run by the biggest criminals in the world, we aren’t pretending to be the good guys
[11/13/22, 8:13:59 PM] Peter Peng: We are just about the people
[11/13/22, 8:14:25 PM] Dan: Thanks for sharing! Definitely going to dive into learning more
[11/13/22, 8:15:17 PM] Peter Peng: We create laws just to break them… for fun 😎😈
[11/13/22, 8:20:12 PM] Gary Teh: The really fascinating thing about the way the Mongolian horde was structured was how it organically resembles modern day holacracy 

Each unit makes up of ten and the leader is elected by the member of ten. This is the base building block upon which the entire Mongolian horde was constructed from. Like Lego bricks

Incompetent leaders in each unit were quickly replaced by the most capable amongst the ten 

And ten happens to the about the size of Jeff Bezos two pizza rule

[11/15/22, 7:23:37 AM] Gary Teh: There seems usually a fine line between “genius” and “idiot” 

Anyways “genius” and “idiot” is just what the public perceives. The underling person is still the same

I am sure he will bounce back again just like how Adam Neumann (founder of WeWork) did. Just another case of RnD gone wrong 🤔

[11/15/22, 7:28:15 AM] Gary Teh: And in case we came late to prevent the scam we will need to apply some salve to ease their pain by inviting them to the do nothing society to regain some equanimity

So that they don’t do something rash like committing suicide after massive monetary loses

[11/15/22, 8:47:24 AM] Gary Teh: I think the RnD process of Alexandra Graham Bell for phones

The Wright brother’s for flight 

And Einstein’s for light bulb will be good reference 

First step will be to dig into research work done so far in the field of physics to identify if findings that might theoretically support parts of it. 

Then reproduce their research results to make sure their findings are reproducible 

Once done then start tinkering to figure out how all the nuts and bolts would fit together to support this new kind of communication that we call telepathy 

Right now I have not much bandwidth to do much in that department I am sure other keen and interested folks might be keen to dive down that rabbit hole with their spare time 🙂🙏

[11/15/22, 2:24:49 PM] Aga - DAOist: I was just watching now and there is no confirmation yet from where was this missiles and it doesn't seem that it was an intentional attack. There is actually a possibility it came from Ukraine.. but they rather use it against Putin.. 🤷‍♀️
[11/15/22, 2:25:10 PM] Peter Peng: He’s only saying that because he can’t control it. Everything is a fraud if you think about it.

Since there is really a lot of upside (up to USD125K) per successful hit

Maybe there might be an opportunity to setup a shadow organization just to fully exploit this lack of care until everybody starts caring 

Thoughts?

It doesn’t make sense to break up monopolies especially tech platforms since it ends up screwing up a lot of the codebase and makes the end solution more convoluted than necessary 

I think a more effect approach would be to figure out how to convert these private properties into the property of the commons once these platforms achieve a certain scale

Just like no single person should monopolize all the water supply or clean air in the world.
[11/15/22, 3:07:48 PM] Peter Peng: There is always some sort of competition

They don’t care if the viewers do or do not do anything about it. It’s entertainment to them. Not news

but I think Ukraine shot the missiles. There is pressure from their western masters to end this war.

[11/16/22, 2:38:45 AM] Peter Peng: US, China and NATO alliance. The Russians have proved time and again that they are too susceptible to corruption and cannot form sustainable governments. They also created the Communist Manifesto, who’s corrupt ideology has only spread evil, death and destruction globally.
[11/16/22, 3:10:56 AM] Peter Peng: I would suggest that during the occupation of Russia by the US, China, and NATO… that we dismantle their financial system, access to the internet (prevent cyberwarfare) and tightly control the food supply in order to prevent uprising. It’s the only way to keep a superpower like that under control and prevent them from doing more destruction. Many of the Anti-Putin Russians have fled so now it’s time to execute the plan to secure homeland security for the entire world.

[11/16/22, 10:25:28 AM] Tres Garcia: Ugh.... 😑 Words Matter... 

As a 19+ veteran of the "Deep State" I am offended that he does not signal the difference between the Deep State and political parties that manage to get themselves fired every 4 to 8 years.

The deep state are the patriotic men and women who come to work every day and keep the lights on no matter who the president is or who is in control of the house and senate. 

This is everyone from the Military, SBA, IRS, Justice Dept., IC, and even the Post Office. 

No... There is not a great conspiracy between the US and Crypto... The Deep state has been watching this for over 10 years now and is not coordinated enough to react to the rate of change. Moreover, the Deep State is too busy keeping the govt. moving. If we wanted it off... We would just pass legislation shutting it off. End of story. No house of cards. No conspiracy. 

As for the actions of citizens that support the Democratic party... All of his statements are speculative and require further research as to what is true. Did donations go to Ukraine? Yes. 
Where they spend on US contractors providing goods? We do not know yet. 
Were the Donations stolen? No. 
Can we prove that the donations came from FTX user holding? No. Not at this time
So why are we complaining about donated funds? 

This guy is really smart if you see some of his other videos. (ie FXT and Alameda market maker = prop up FTX token) But he does not understand the magnitude of money as a weapon or the deep state.
[11/16/22, 10:27:18 AM] Tres Garcia: FTX / Alameda boils down to 3x things: Incompetence, Greed, and a complete lack of Due Diligence.

CZ got it right... Why did everyone miss it? Because CZ did his homework and kept digging.

Version A) it is your mail man and every civil service worker keeping Govt services alive and working
Version B) is what people in tinfoil hats believe in
[11/16/22, 11:22:41 AM] Tres Garcia: There is a lot to unpack here: 
He is not wrong about a lot, but he is a bit misinformed. All in all it is a glimpse in where decentralized platforms are going as well as the hurdles they will face in combating disinformation, hate speech, terror promotion and poor journalism.

- Phase 2: Roll out to all 37K registered users of GetData.IO

- Phase 3: roll out to all 22K community members of Earn.Games

- Phase 4: official launch during Davos Jan 2022 in Switzerland

- Phase 5: get all my influencer friends (celebirites) to get their followers onboard

Child porn and snuff films are all illegal right now in our society. 

But what if the actors are all AI generated characters that don’t exist in real life. 

Is generating such kinds of content where no real humans are involved still technically illegal?  🤔

Also board members (VCs) are by governance not allowed to deploy funds in this area 

This is basically what is governing AI research right now

I believe it’s a great time to extend upon this foundation by implementing quadratic voting to allow members to vote and determine the amount of governance tokens for all the action typed defined in our rubric

Thoughts?

Rather is the most voters rich or poor being dumber on the matters. 😂

[11/18/22, 10:31:40 PM] Peter Peng: Twitter should have had a Web3 strategy
[11/18/22, 10:31:51 PM] Peter Peng: Issuing NFTs on the platform
[11/18/22, 10:32:20 PM] Peter Peng: They would have made bank, like a social Opensea
[11/18/22, 10:32:47 PM] Johnson Teh: I am kidding but I do agree w Elon

If twitter is any good it will be profitable by now with all the election Woha eyeball… if it is not then it only some of the staffs isn’t as good and shld be let good, beside lunch is the last thing a worker need if they love their job
[11/18/22, 10:34:05 PM] Johnson Teh: Yap these at twitter were busy using their shareholders resources to achieve their own expression of whatever agenda, hence it is a poorly managed Coy.

[11/19/22, 12:27:11 AM] Gary Teh: When I look deeply at the whole DEFi and NFT space, majority of the projects that have no real proven utility already baked into their core tokenomics just end up with a dry liquidity pool overtime. 

Adding yielding and staking to draw in additional liquidity before there is proven utility is just masking and distracting the unsuspecting from the underlying foundational problem 

Any projects that don’t have proven utility, has baked in staking and yielding and a whole bunch of hype associated with it are based on my assessment just straight up Pump and Dump schemes 

In hindsight after observing this space for these past 11 months, and then critically reassessing the “advice” received from quite a few of these “investor” profile types I have spoken with, I conclude a lot of them are just misinformed and have given really bad “advice”

My sense is the next wave of web3 projects which will come about during this crypto winter will set the foundation for the next two decades of internet. They will however be built following strict product management methodologies. 

Basically the ecosystem is no longer receptive to the kind of bullshit we have observed these past 24 months

This from my perspective is very very healthy 🙂

[11/19/22, 12:50:06 AM] Gary Teh: Netflix and Zappos have gone through this process before as well in one form or another. 

Having less employees in a tech company is counter-intuitively better. Less processes, less communication overhead, less politics and simply more time freed up to get SH*T done.
[11/19/22, 12:58:08 AM] Gary Teh: During this round of physical survey of this ecosystem, my observation is that while layoffs at public big tech firms are dominating news headlines right now, a lot of the Pre-IPO companies with strong growth metrics are still very aggressively hiring. Some of them targeting to double their head counts over the next 12 months. 

My sense is this discrepancies I am observing is another one of those categorical "Fake" news.

[11/19/22, 1:31:58 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: People are clueless on how a corp works
[11/19/22, 2:01:53 AM] Gary Teh: I think @6598383264 did mentioned this principle before about the mining industry which could be generalized to all industries. 

practitioners within any industry generally access news about companies within their industries differently from folks not within those industries. The primary difference is because of the mental model they have about the space that non-practitioners are not familiar with. 

When you look back at historical Facebook data during the early days, every time they end up getting splashed across all news headlines because of some really bad PR, their DAU actually went up. Social Networks are anti-fragile. The more (positive/negative) PR there is the better. 

Right now twitter only has 150 million registered. All this bad PR by traditional press is actually free publicity for Twitter.
[11/19/22, 2:03:20 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: At the end of the day I think what we are witnessing is the maturity of an industry … next will be banks etc anything that has tech in it will get rid of 50% of their teams gonna be hard but great opportunity to build startups now
[11/19/22, 2:05:37 AM] Gary Teh: I think Web3 is a really juicy space right now in that regard with the crazy recent shake out. No need to compete against snake oil sales men who raised a lot of cash from ill-informed investors while driving up price of resources in the process.
[11/19/22, 2:06:26 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: No sure
[11/19/22, 2:06:38 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: I think this just shows that Bitcoin is a better approach

[11/19/22, 2:30:18 AM] Gary Teh: @12063955455 one thing that still puzzles me right now is why MAS choose Polygon instead of Ethereum for their pilot. The only reason I could think of is because that decision was made before Ethereum merge happened.

[11/19/22, 2:30:52 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Transaction fees I guess
[11/19/22, 2:31:22 AM] Gary Teh: Ethereum moved over to POS, so theoretically the transaction fees should dropped. Or am I mistaken?
[11/19/22, 2:33:28 AM] Gary Teh: @12063955455  If Ethereum's gas fees has since dropped to levels similar to Polygon then Polygon might have lucked out managing to capture enough traction during the window

[11/19/22, 2:50:20 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: a bigger block would help for example
[11/19/22, 9:46:59 AM] Tres Garcia: I agree that a utility token should be just that, a way to use a platform to do something. The token should not be speculative, but rather a way to show interest in using the platform.

I guess more and more people will be starting to wake up to this reality. 

Was chatting with @48606646246 this morning about the diffusion of technology and it is not our job as the innovators to convince the early majority to this space. 

But rather it is the job of early adopters like Bill Ackman and maybe even Elon Musk to onboard the early majority 

@14152032783 thanks for helping make the introduction today, our tokenomics model will be feature in a research thesis on token based crowd sourcing for social entrepreneurship 🙂🙏

[11/20/22, 5:23:15 PM] Gary Teh: I was explaining to Yousra over dinner the other day, proper application is perfect for creating multi side market places not just two sided ones. Hence what is most important at the upfront is defining clearly what a community’s values are. And then tokenizing real world actions that yield those desired values. 

In our case it’s basically actions that yield more Autonomy, Integrity and Diversity while detracting fake content circulation in our world 🤩
[11/20/22, 7:12:42 PM] Tim Fong: Some kind of theranos crypto’s that help with Covid maybe. Seems like a good tool for generating fake news :)
[11/20/22, 7:20:04 PM] Gary Teh: Theranos crypto? What is that 🤩
[11/20/22, 11:46:26 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, I have finished updating this page to ensure the links to our chatrooms are only exposed to members who have more than 100 TDG token holdings in their wallet and on ledger 

https://TrueSight.me/dao

Need to update the SSL certificate on our servers before I can deploy the new code to production
[11/20/22, 11:47:58 PM] Gary Teh: Will expose that as something that DAO members can vote on too here along with governance token grants for other actions

https://truesight.me/dao/vote
[11/20/22, 11:49:11 PM] Gary Teh: I guess in 12minutes time we will officially shift over to quadratic voting in our network!! 🤩
[11/20/22, 11:54:31 PM] Gary Teh: Once this done, we will start rolling out cypher defense chrome extension to the broader community 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/chrome

The 100 governance token threshold will act as a filter to ensure only genuinely engaged and aligned members will qualify to join us in our network of chatrooms (with the exception of the do nothing society which serves as a get to know you landing pad )

That way quality of discussions about future directions of our network is maintained at a conducive level

Its basically a plug and play pattern where injection is mainly handled by AI which I believe is housed in the mixer services

[11/21/22, 11:20:58 PM] Gary Teh: By the way Ekson rejoined out network. I gave him a severe warning 

If he reaches out and strange DMs please inform me ASAP.

Not only will he be banned In WhatsApp channels

His emails and his IP addresses will be permanently banned at the server levels

@16506464893  Ray is starting to look into similar model to agrihood and ecoverse21. I proposed for him to reach out to you to further explore the model you have in mind

Meanwhile his wife Lan tapping on her experience on figuring out a framework quantify network exploitation like those of Amazon's. I would imagine that framework would help inform us on how to manage the extraction rates a DAO  charge for transactions passing through their networks without it going beyond the exploitation threshold while still keeping the network viable.

[11/22/22, 11:46:18 AM] Gary Teh: As an experiment here is how I have been generally setting my priorities in terms of time allocation for the 3 hour daily I devote to any form of activities before going back to doing nothing

Top priority = human and relationship concerns

Second priority = task concerns

Lowest priority = machine/software concerns 

Anything beyond the 3 hour threshold = inshallal it shall be done tomorrow 🤣

Also really looking forward to the forthcoming token exchange partnership between TrueSight DAO and the OffChain global! 🤩

Folks, tentatively we are floating the exchange rate of 1 TrueSight DAO governance token to 1 OffChain global Governance token 

Will share more as more details on the OffChain global tokenomics gets fleshed out

Exciting times 🤩🙏

[11/23/22, 7:05:20 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. Was chatting today with @14152032783 where I mentioned we are chain agnostic 

We could easily mint ERC20 and then allow bridging on our servers at a later stage if members want to move elsewhere
[11/23/22, 7:07:36 PM] Peter Peng: I just logged in, you are giving $5 TDG per sign up?

[11/23/22, 8:45:18 PM] Gary Teh: By the way, @48691650760 thanks for introducing Denny 

We have started discussions on collaboration 

I see opportunity for us to farm out Edgar our resident AI to help support their project 

We are still discovering how deep our collaboration is going to be

At the most simple level, we might just end up charging their project our governance tokens for access to Edgar. So they will either need to earn it by contributing to our DAO or buy them  

Once things become clearer we will allow members to vote on how much governance tokens to charge projects per call to Edgar 🙂🙏

[11/23/22, 9:21:38 PM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Ray (from JDFi) two nights that at some point a lot of things will end up getting automated by AI and robots

At that point we will all be forced one way or another to join the Do Nothing society. 

At that stage we will have no choice but to think deeply about what it really means to be human
[11/23/22, 9:22:29 PM] Gary Teh: I think that is going to be a very important subject for education in the very near future
[11/23/22, 9:23:23 PM] Peter Peng: Well, I feel like everyone’s new job will be building AI and robots and providing human data to the system. They will be paid in “AI Coins”
[11/23/22, 9:24:10 PM] Peter Peng: Imagine being paid to live
[11/23/22, 9:24:26 PM] Gary Teh: In that regard I think our governance tokens is one of the very first of those coin type

[11/23/22, 10:03:34 PM] Gary Teh: Am thinking through the architecture for this 

Right now those transactions will just be stored in our database 

There might come a certain point when it makes more sense to run this “custodial” model directly on polygon chain itself when expected monthly AWS database fees for storing those transactions outweighed the expected gas fees for just writing those transactions immediately on Polygon 

Will probably have to spend some time to dig into the costing side if this use case ever gains traction 🤔

[11/24/22, 8:07:20 AM] Gary Teh: @6598383264 You folks should really meet to talk about the real estate tokenization project if you are still looking to head down that route

[11/24/22, 9:06:17 AM] Francois renet: medias
[11/24/22, 10:22:00 AM] Anita Lamprecht: thank you for sharing yourself.
[11/24/22, 10:22:51 AM] Anita Lamprecht: pollination of knowledge ... this hits a weak spot.
[11/24/22, 10:26:39 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i was talking with my legal publishing friend/colleague about securing knowledge against theft by using blockchain technology (Tres and I discussed it in cypher defense). he has the same problem as Tres. it is not used by anyone.. pollination of knowledge.. that is the real problem. people are scared of sparking ideas in other people. thank you @14153000019 . that seems to be the missing thought.
[11/24/22, 10:38:14 AM] Anita Lamprecht: At least to me 😂.

[11/24/22, 10:48:28 AM] Francois renet: how is that working out??😂
[11/24/22, 10:49:51 AM] Gary Teh: Well the chi 气 has been flowing harmonically through the DAO 道 ☯️🤣

So I guess the framework might be working out nicely 🤔

[11/24/22, 10:54:37 AM] Gary Teh: First time I chanced upon such a method effectively deployed in life and death scenario was when I read the book Three Kingdoms when military genius Zhugeliang deployed it to confused and destroy the northern troops of Wei 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Sentinel_Maze

This stuff is can have a quite brutal impact when applied by an expert.

[11/24/22, 11:37:58 AM] Dita: Happy Thanksgiving for everyone as well!!
[11/24/22, 12:08:38 PM] Gary Teh: Was just reading through some of the shared materials that @447492703707 sent over just now 

Here is what I feel the future AR  metaverse experience should be like 

The equipment should be no heavier than my current pair of glasses 

It should just be voice activated as I am already used to with Apple’s Siri

Siri should respond to me as she is already doing 

Instead of showing visual updates on my phone screen it should just show the visual updates in my glasses if there are any relevant visual outputs

The interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri what is this thing I am seeing in front of me right now”

“Gary it’s that time of the year when the US government reminds you to pay your taxes. Would you like to get it processed?”

“Yes please”

End of interaction 🤣
[11/24/22, 12:11:49 PM] Gary Teh: In the event of visual outputs, Siri should just detect where I am looking at and know what I am talking about

The interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri call you help me call Bob”

“Gary there are four Bobs who are you referring to?”

Siri proceeds to show the face of all four bobs on my glasses 

I look at the right Bob and say “that bob”

“Got it”

Ring tone heard. 

End of interaction
[11/24/22, 12:14:38 PM] Gary Teh: The Metaverse and AI should behave like that invisible friend we all imagined we had when we were growing up 

Kind of there but not in the way of my other day to day interactions with the environment 

The current experience just feels too clunky
[11/24/22, 12:14:45 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Or you interact with the blink of your eyes.
[11/24/22, 12:15:02 PM] Gary Teh: But I blink all the time 🤣
[11/24/22, 12:16:01 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Well then you need to train either yourself or your unvisible best friend. 😇
[11/24/22, 12:16:49 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Uncontrolled thinking could also be the downside of mind control devices …
[11/24/22, 12:18:18 PM] Gary Teh: Actually usually when speaking to someone and referring to something in the environment without using my hands I just do a slight node with my head in that direction 

I think that signal should be easy to pick up
[11/24/22, 12:18:34 PM] Gary Teh: Or even just looking at an item and then saying that one
[11/24/22, 12:19:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I think that’s how the mind controlling devices for gaming work.
[11/24/22, 12:19:35 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! Is it controlling your mind or your controlling it?
[11/24/22, 12:20:02 PM] Gary Teh: I just want my interact with the device to be as minimal as possible
[11/24/22, 12:20:32 PM] Anita Lamprecht: https://www.next-mind.com/
[11/24/22, 12:21:09 PM] Anita Lamprecht: First you control it and then it will depend who owns your data.
[11/24/22, 12:32:18 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. If data ownership not centralized and dependency on platform is not too great then user experience will not likely to turn oppressive overtime
[11/24/22, 1:16:06 PM] Tres Garcia: I get too much grief when I talk to my invisible friends. 😏
[11/24/22, 1:17:23 PM] Tres Garcia: Taxes: “don’t be silly Gary, I’ve already calculated and paid your taxes for you, and you owe nothing & will not have to wait for a return because it’s a perfect $0.”
[11/24/22, 1:38:56 PM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Vigi, 

I am leaving tom night. So can’t join in. 
Only have a 3 days stay this trip, I am only in Dubai to get my residency proved and meet with Emmar who is
our partner in the crypto.
[11/24/22, 1:53:58 PM] Ved Sinha: Well said and hopefully enlightening for the readers!
[11/24/22, 1:57:27 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect UI/UX 🤩

No UX is the best UX. Don’t even need to think about it

So basically the interaction would go like this 

“Hey Siri what is that”

“Never mind Gary. Already settled.”

“Great!”

End of interaction 🤣
[11/24/22, 2:45:41 PM] Gary Teh: Actually another even better UI/UX just occurred to me 🤔

This is how the interaction should go.

“Hey Siri..”

“Hey Gary, just like yesterday there is absolutely nothing to do today.” 

“Oh Got it” 

End of interaction 🤣

If you feel like getting a taste of the future right now help yourself to some…

[11/24/22, 3:36:14 PM] Brian -IOM: @14153000019 I think for a lot of people AR glasses will be about having a giant virtual cinema screen they can just plant on their head and watch! It’s a bit like how iPads were content consumsption devices before they were serious workstations.
[11/24/22, 5:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: I think it’s going to be a great experience 

I am just looking forward to the day i don’t  have to use my hands for typing 

I am lazy and just want to do nothing !  🤣

[11/25/22, 9:02:01 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: I love elon lol
[11/25/22, 9:02:37 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Invest wise would just focus on Bitcoin at the moment
[11/25/22, 9:02:49 AM] Franck Nouyrigat: Staying away from any exchanges …
[11/25/22, 9:41:39 AM] Gary Teh: Lol! @41798496023 went on a rampage on centralized exchanges yesterday while we were chatting 

The sticking point is these exchanges are not behaving properly as exchanges should

You do not see Nasdaq or NYSE and behaving like VCs by investing consumer deposits into projects 

That is the job of investors not exchanges 🤔
[11/25/22, 9:53:05 AM] Peter Peng: With all the seriousness of what’s going on in the crypto markets, I think we might see a little bit of fun with meme coins

[11/25/22, 1:28:37 PM] Peter Peng: I think they like it also
[11/25/22, 1:28:40 PM] Aga - DAOist: Lovely 😍😍😍 we DON'T need to comply!!! 💪💪💪
[11/25/22, 1:29:46 PM] Peter Peng: I mean, if it’s a stablecoin… fine.
[11/25/22, 1:30:01 PM] Peter Peng: But we already have too many of them
[11/25/22, 1:30:15 PM] Aga - DAOist: Tricky.. 🤔 yet I think that the more different sources we have, we can formulate our own opinions better.
[11/25/22, 1:30:36 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe just another option
[11/25/22, 1:31:27 PM] Aga - DAOist: Crypto vs CBDCs is like comparing chairs - a normal chair and an electric chair.. it not for our good at all..
[11/25/22, 1:33:08 PM] Peter Peng: I’m fine with a CBDC, but it needs to be on a public ledger or it defeats the whole purpose
[11/25/22, 1:37:46 PM] Aga - DAOist: Are you really fine with govenments being able to block your account, limit your transactions or decide what you spend your money for? Good luck. I don't comply with it.
[11/25/22, 1:42:20 PM] Peter Peng: I think there will be a need for Web3 banks 🏦
[11/25/22, 1:42:37 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not worried about the government

[11/25/22, 1:44:52 PM] Peter Peng: The CIA created Bitcoin
[11/25/22, 1:45:42 PM] Peter Peng: Satoshi Nakamoto translated stands for “central intelligence”
[11/25/22, 2:03:34 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: It’s a possibility but it doesn’t really stand when you consider the bashing of Bitcoin along with the fact that it gets around Avery border that had given the US control in the first place along with an alternative to swift to avoid sanctions
[11/25/22, 2:03:51 PM] Neil Daud Maxwell: More likely it came from Aliens 👽 💫🚀
[11/25/22, 2:14:53 PM] Peter Peng: It’s how the government controls you, prior to Bitcoin was cash inside your mattress
[11/25/22, 2:15:19 PM] Peter Peng: They want everything to be digital

Tech is too new for the govt to handle properly. 
Needs to be clear reg on state surveillance before rolling it out.
[11/25/22, 3:56:13 PM] Gary Teh: What i am sensing is countries with larger GDPs with potential clout for having currencies international reserve currencies statuses will want to RnD and run their own blockchain where their own CBDC will be ran on. Much like what China and US are doing right now

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/16/china-blockchain-explainer-what-is-bsn-.html

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/runs-on-algorithmic-stablecoins-evidence-from-iron-titan-and-steel-20220602.html

Countries with too little economic clout will end up opting to establish their own CBdC on the chains of other countries chain or public chains

The percentage of the average daily human activities has not always been so monetized if you looked back as recent as century ago 

Nothing preventing us from “un-monetizing” a whole bunch of those activities that got monetized over the past 100 years 🤔

[11/26/22, 11:09:38 PM] Peter Peng: I’m convinced politicians are the closest (but they still have to work a little)
[11/26/22, 11:11:07 PM] Gary Teh: They work so hard they end up addicted to work 🤣
[11/26/22, 11:14:10 PM] Peter Peng: Or drugs lol 😂 … Washington DC has the highest rate of drug usage in the country
[11/26/22, 11:14:42 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe everyone there is a drug dealer haha
[11/26/22, 11:36:21 PM] Peter Peng: The truth is… drug dealers rule the world 🌎
[11/26/22, 11:36:37 PM] Peter Peng: TrueSight
[11/26/22, 11:36:55 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[11/27/22, 12:28:47 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of drug dealing I was on a call with one of the leaders of the House of Balance this afternoon where I was helping restructure the operating budget to pull everything off the Fiat system to directly tap on the decentralized crowdsourcing mechanism 

Was also helping bake in Do Nothing spaces into the ecosystem to serves
 the purpose of energizing the do something spaces 

Strangely that conversation ended up getting labeled a very psychedelic experience by the leader after the hour long conversation was done 

Perhaps drug dealing can come in many forms 🤔
[11/27/22, 12:35:57 AM] Gary Teh: One very edgy concept that surfaced during the conversation was around tackling the problem of flying some of the project leaders in during the event

A lot of corporation literally have flier miles lying around unused due to the tons of flights booked for corporates executives in their companies 

So the idea is to allow them to donate their flight miles to the non-profit foundation that is already up and running in exchange for governance tokens plus the additional bonus of being able to write these off for tax credits 🤯
[11/27/22, 12:38:30 AM] Francois renet: bigger problem is travelers who do not use their miles. My buddy Kene is working on a concept to use rewards across multiple companies. in a time where people are struggling, using rewards from one store to another could be a way to survive
[11/27/22, 12:39:01 AM] Gary Teh: I am starting to get the sense that the deeper and more spiritually stirring the WHY the further out into the unknown the crowd sourcing approach could be pushed 🤔

[11/27/22, 12:46:34 AM] Francois renet: exactly!
[11/27/22, 12:49:07 AM] Gary Teh: It’s also going to be very fascinating to observe OffChain ecosystem as the tokenomics that me and @14152032783are RnDing unfolds within that space 

My sense is in the short run it’s going to bear semblance to the PitchDao network structure

In the long run, there is potential to bake in the Unconference protocol me @41799155602 and Zoran RnDed on when we were in Belgrad earlier this year
[11/27/22, 12:49:55 AM] Gary Teh: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tY4POL9JP72FRyF-GItbSX_knsZl-rA1j9kJ4FJ2o3Y/edit
[11/27/22, 12:59:07 AM] Gary Teh: One of the key challenges I observed in Belgrad when me and @41799155602 sat down in Belgrad to think through the topography of interlinked utility centric networks which @41799155602 loosely termed the Global DAO alliance was that there were not enough human energy available 

In hindsight it made more sense from an energy conservation stand point to just go about discovering communities, with DNAs already aligned with some of these utilities, that are also motivated to evolve in this direction, and then aiding them with their efforts at evolution

[11/27/22, 1:22:12 AM] Francois renet: If what you mean is that most people are inherently lazy and reticent to change then I agree 100%!
[11/27/22, 2:01:40 AM] Peter Peng: What does it inherently mean to “do nothing”? I feel like I’m always doing something but it has evolved over the years.
[11/27/22, 2:02:19 AM] Peter Peng: Society is redefining what “doing something” is…
[11/27/22, 2:03:04 AM] Peter Peng: We cannot do good for the world if we are enslaved
[11/27/22, 2:03:43 AM] Peter Peng: I think humanity collectively realized this when Covid19 hit
[11/27/22, 2:06:23 AM] Peter Peng: My belief that AI and automation can effectively help ease us out of doing jobs we don’t want to do
[11/27/22, 2:07:12 AM] Peter Peng: And move us toward action
[11/27/22, 2:08:51 AM] Peter Peng: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States
[11/27/22, 2:10:52 AM] Francois renet: but some of the jobs we don't want to do are a livelyhood for others. take Uber as an example, it helps hundreds of thousands of people live, but the ultimate goal is to replace the drivers with self driving cars which means tremendous lost of income. And we are nowhere near providing a universal paycheck to replace that income, most governments are over indebted already.
[11/27/22, 2:11:24 AM] Peter Peng: Can’t we tax the AI?
[11/27/22, 2:11:59 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not going to happen overnight
[11/27/22, 2:12:08 AM] Peter Peng: People will reassimilate
[11/27/22, 2:12:34 AM] Peter Peng: We also need help training the AI, so that will also be a job
[11/27/22, 2:12:47 AM] Peter Peng: For the new couple decades
[11/27/22, 2:12:51 AM] Peter Peng: Next
[11/27/22, 2:13:22 AM] Peter Peng: We also need help coding and building the AI and robots
[11/27/22, 2:14:56 AM] Peter Peng: Same arguments apply for when tractors 🚜 took over farming
[11/27/22, 2:15:29 AM] Francois renet: that's an interesting question. i got into a debate recently with someone about AI and monetization. they were using a humanoid to go to the house of parliament in england. to cut a long story short, i made the case that what we were creating was the slaves of the 21st century. happy to have that conversation offline so as to not overkill here. it is our need to humanize robots that is the biggest issue. we haven't really started yet, and there are already people fighting for the rights of machine. we are replacing one issue with another. and i am convinced that those who will win the AI race will just monetize it in a way to keep the gains to a minimum number of people
[11/27/22, 2:16:47 AM] Peter Peng: Robots don’t need rights, they are property
[11/27/22, 2:17:15 AM] Francois renet: and look at the state of agriculture today. let's use machines to alleviate the work that is back breaking, but let's not race to replace humans altogether. some people are not built to just work with their minds, and those are the ones who suffer from automatization, which at the end of the day is built to cut down on cost of labor and increase revenue. nothing to do with kindness for man. it's about profits
[11/27/22, 2:17:42 AM] Francois renet: not what the guy going to the house of parliament was saying! that's my point
[11/27/22, 2:18:29 AM] Francois renet: and he was using a humanoid that was a good looking girl to make the point. i argued that under the fake skin were two cameras, a CPU and robotic limbs, but that was not his belief
[11/27/22, 2:18:56 AM] Peter Peng: They still have a choice to grow their own food… most don’t. Most people adapt and assimilate when given the opportunity.
[11/27/22, 2:20:15 AM] Peter Peng: They don’t need look like sex bots…
[11/27/22, 2:21:34 AM] Francois renet: i agree. but we all know sex sells, and that's what they are using. it's a great distraction. i read a really cool article on how some cultures need robots to look mecanical, and others need them to look like people.
[11/27/22, 2:22:35 AM] Peter Peng: Either way, the robots should be protected by the owners.
[11/27/22, 2:22:40 AM] Peter Peng: It’s like a car
[11/27/22, 2:23:13 AM] Francois renet: it's humanizing them in any form that's dangerous. it affects perception. we are wired a certain way. in sf they did an experiment where they put a robot in a hotel after hours for room service. the first one looked mecanical and guests destroyed it. they replaced it with a human looking one, and no one touched it
[11/27/22, 2:23:22 AM] Peter Peng: If someone damages my car then it’s a crime
[11/27/22, 2:24:12 AM] Francois renet: but then we risk people fighting with people to protect their robots? and who will be able to afford a robot? it's building a new inequality layer, no?
[11/27/22, 2:24:54 AM] Peter Peng: I would more likely damage the human looking one
[11/27/22, 2:25:19 AM] Peter Peng: That’s a good thing, protect your robot
[11/27/22, 2:25:31 AM] Peter Peng: Like a car
[11/27/22, 2:25:42 AM] Peter Peng: Or any other asset you have
[11/27/22, 2:25:53 AM] Peter Peng: It’s self regulating
[11/27/22, 2:26:40 AM] Peter Peng: Basically… “Don’t be stupid”
[11/27/22, 2:27:17 AM] Francois renet: i rest my case 😂 because as humanity, history shows that we've been really smart!
[11/27/22, 2:28:58 AM] Peter Peng: I just see it being no different from owning a car or a dog. If someone harmed or damaged something that belongs to me they will receive repercussions. I don’t see it introducing more issues.
‎[11/27/22, 2:30:49 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[11/27/22, 2:38:18 AM] Peter Peng: I think AI + Automation will be a luxury product as it rolls out first.
[11/27/22, 2:38:52 AM] Peter Peng: Kinda like how Tesla started off with the roadster for EVs
[11/27/22, 2:42:27 AM] Francois renet: not quite the same. robots will give some people an advantage that cars don't. cars consume. robots will produce. he who has the robot first will win.
[11/27/22, 2:43:21 AM] Peter Peng: That’s with any business that stays innovative
[11/27/22, 2:44:03 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure every business will be able to afford a robot
[11/27/22, 2:44:17 AM] Peter Peng: Or robots
[11/27/22, 2:44:40 AM] Peter Peng: Some may not want a robot
[11/27/22, 2:45:36 AM] Peter Peng: This is why I like the idea of cryptocurrencies, it allows different economies to form based on preferences/choice
[11/27/22, 2:45:58 AM] Peter Peng: For example, I can create a whole economy just for robots 🤖
[11/27/22, 2:48:41 AM] Peter Peng: I still believe that ultimately, AI and automation can do more good than harm
[11/27/22, 2:49:55 AM] Peter Peng: There will always be some sort of issues that arise but that’s just the nature of the beast 🦾
[11/27/22, 2:51:07 AM] Francois renet: only time will tell @14075792560 !
[11/27/22, 2:55:37 AM] Peter Peng: Brave New World 🌎

[11/27/22, 6:19:30 PM] Peter Peng: We will no longer become dominant and just fighting for survival?
[11/27/22, 6:20:11 PM] Peter Peng: Or do we (humans) turn the robots into a species?

[11/27/22, 6:36:06 PM] Peter Peng: AI represents the Aliens
[11/27/22, 6:36:37 PM] Gary Teh: Jack Ma calls AI = Love

So maybe AI is god??
[11/27/22, 6:37:22 PM] Peter Peng: AI is definitely not love
[11/27/22, 6:38:12 PM] Peter Peng: It’s an advanced calculator
[11/27/22, 6:40:19 PM] Peter Peng: Or it could be that Aliens (robots) created Humans in a bio lab 🧫 sent bacteria to Earth 🌍 and now we are creating AI and Robots to visit our creator in order to close the cycle.
[11/27/22, 6:45:37 PM] Peter Peng: Life appeared on Earth 3.7 billion years ago, but due to light years this all be happening in near real time with our creator (Aliens or God).
[11/27/22, 6:46:09 PM] Peter Peng: Based on perception
[11/27/22, 6:48:27 PM] Peter Peng: So essentially we are creating God / Aliens and they are creating us at the same time.
[11/27/22, 6:53:18 PM] Peter Peng: I’d like to think that Humans are Aliens and God is simply a molecule.

[11/28/22, 12:24:37 AM] Kelvin Chew: But it will rise again. Next year end or 2024. If it doesn’t break 70k meaningfully. That’s the end of BTC with the right shoulder.
[11/28/22, 2:05:19 AM] Peter Peng: Do you think Ethereum can flip BTC?
[11/28/22, 2:06:27 AM] Kelvin Chew: Why would u think that
[11/28/22, 2:07:00 AM] Peter Peng: Because of all the Dapps being built currently, it’s about to explode
[11/28/22, 2:07:56 AM] Peter Peng: Polygon and Ethereum
[11/28/22, 2:08:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just because something is build. Doesn’t guarantee it’s usage
[11/28/22, 2:09:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just like tons of NFTs are made. But who is talking about it now
[11/28/22, 2:09:31 AM] Peter Peng: Ones with real world utility

[11/28/22, 2:11:09 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not even an argument, im just stating facts
[11/28/22, 2:11:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: Now. Who are the direct competitors to Dapps. Meaning established organisations with real world influence and tons of firepower
[11/28/22, 2:14:13 AM] Peter Peng: Corporations are starting to build Dapps, Google and Amazon are building blockchain hosting solutions. They are getting ready for it. So I don’t understand you argument
[11/28/22, 2:14:43 AM] Johnson Teh: I just secured the rights to buy freehold prime land with BTC from one of the Govt owned developers in Middle East….

Will this considered as common use of crypto?
[11/28/22, 2:14:46 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not Dapps vs. Corporations
[11/28/22, 2:15:36 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, but is it on a smart contract?
[11/28/22, 2:16:48 AM] Peter Peng: I believe the smart contracts make it verifiable that you own it on a universal ledger system meaning that if that government collapses you would still own that peice of land
[11/28/22, 2:17:07 AM] Peter Peng: This is where ETH comes in
[11/28/22, 2:18:28 AM] Anita Lamprecht: as lawyer the smart contract function is vital for a blockchain ecosystem.
[11/28/22, 2:18:54 AM] Anita Lamprecht: if you really own the physical land would depend if the legal system in question allows the entry in a blockchain as sufficient.
[11/28/22, 2:19:17 AM] Anita Lamprecht: usually it would need to be connected to a conventional land register
[11/28/22, 2:19:36 AM] Anita Lamprecht: depends on the country and how sophisticated their land registration system is.
[11/28/22, 2:19:59 AM] Anita Lamprecht: but.. if already digital. it could easily connected to a smart contract. without a lot of oracles missing it up :0)
[11/28/22, 2:20:16 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i know dubai is making massive steps in this direction.
[11/28/22, 2:20:28 AM] Anita Lamprecht: used to live and work in dxb a couple of years ago.
[11/28/22, 2:20:43 AM] Peter Peng: I can’t wait until Dapps start to take over… it’s a whole new ball game.
[11/28/22, 2:21:16 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, I hear that Dubai is doing some great things in the space.
[11/28/22, 2:21:32 AM] Anita Lamprecht: this is one topic i would really like to discuss with you. what do you need from the lawyers to make dapps successful ...
[11/28/22, 2:22:48 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Dxb... potentially yes. will be a question of religion and politics in which direction it is ultimately heading.
[11/28/22, 2:23:37 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i think lawyers could be a great support in setting up smart contracts, dapps... but OMG. most of them are sooo far away from the topic.
[11/28/22, 2:23:44 AM] Peter Peng: My firm has one based in DC working on regulation and legislation. In general, lawyers should work with blockchain developers to automate entire processes
[11/28/22, 2:24:27 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes. i am trying to serve as a bridge between tech and legal people. there is a communication challenge between the two sides. not understanding each other...
[11/28/22, 2:25:09 AM] Anita Lamprecht: this is why i am also very grateful to be in gary's groups. KYC :0))
[11/28/22, 2:26:23 AM] Peter Peng: My best advice is to keep it as simple as possible and design the system as if you were creating a “black market” transaction. It sounds terrible but it’s the best path forward.
[11/28/22, 2:27:59 AM] Peter Peng: A “black market” transaction is universal and self-governing so the system can be used in many nations.
[11/28/22, 2:29:10 AM] Peter Peng: Then it can be extensible from there
[11/28/22, 2:30:18 AM] Peter Peng: Through a side-chain
[11/28/22, 5:51:04 AM] Johnson Teh: I am not into tech 
I am only a deal maker fund mgt
😂 

So much appreciated whatever you guys share.

In my old brain, my fund will be owning the land, but the payment mode is in BTC. So the developer is merely collecting BTC instead of bank payment, and the land will be recorded  legally as ours with the land office
[11/28/22, 7:15:25 AM] Gary Teh: DApp are just a new way web applications are built. Software Developers are all starting to shift their development in that direction with all the recent concerns over privacy and data ownership rights 

Even our website can be considered a DApp since part of its functionality depends on you connecting your wallet to it to work
[11/28/22, 7:18:19 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I read most of the 200+ messages here lol and I can add a little something I think!

Doing nothing to me means breaking free of societal expectations and doing what you actually want. That could be creating art, dancing, writing, spending time with friends and family, enjoying nature… it could even be your job! As long as you choose it, you’re free.

Letting go of shame is a big part of doing nothing, because your mind also becomes quieter and more peaceful. Many cultures around the world have already mastered this I think and it’s really the western perspective that pushes productivity on us all!

Our worth =/= how productive we are. 

I spend all my days doing nothing atm (reading, gym, yoga, teaching, editing photos…)

After mastering doing nothing, I think the next step is responsibility/helping people. That’s where fulfilment comes from for most people I think. Once you have a built a life where you can do nothing, what elevates it to a fulfilling life is one where you choose to spend your time helping people/having a responsibility - like teaching, taking care of children, having a purposeful job, taking care of anyone really 🤷‍♀️

Thoughts??
[11/28/22, 7:23:29 AM] Gary Teh: Very nicely framed! 🤩

The way you described it reminds me of the writings of the Zen abbot in the book “Tiger’ Cave” 

The beginning of the journey is directed towards nothing, till the extend reality stops and water becomes still like mirror. 

Then beyond the satori moment when the mirror shatters, everything comes back and fills the universe 🤯
[11/28/22, 7:28:04 AM] Gary Teh: I remember when I was studying the commercial law module back in colleague there is this legal concept called the “indication of interest” where a commercial contract is said to be in effect so long ad a potential buyer makes a down payment (even just USD1) 

With COVID, docusign has became a commonly accepted form of  notarization. 

What would be interesting would be to combine docusign and the addresses of a signed transaction which references the onchain address to the “indication of interest”

I believe this would be a good bridge between both worlds at a very entry level 🤩
[11/28/22, 7:39:41 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Gonna look up this book!

[11/28/22, 8:32:25 AM] Francois renet: if nothing else it kept people at home, and probably doing nothing for most of them!
[11/28/22, 8:37:52 AM] Peter Peng: They will topple the financial system lol
[11/28/22, 8:38:39 AM] Peter Peng: We’re all going crypto now
[11/28/22, 8:38:53 AM] Peter Peng: If China overthrows the government
[11/28/22, 8:39:43 AM] Francois renet: do we think there is a chance of that? how long before they bring in the army?
[11/28/22, 8:42:07 AM] Peter Peng: Not sure if the army can stop billions of people
[11/28/22, 8:42:26 AM] Peter Peng: Hopefully it won’t come to that
[11/28/22, 8:42:42 AM] Francois renet: it's all about what you are willing to give up for freedom. look at Iran and the uprising
[11/28/22, 8:42:43 AM] Peter Peng: Their lockdown must be really bad
[11/28/22, 8:43:31 AM] Peter Peng: The world is changing
[11/28/22, 8:44:52 AM] Francois renet: 100 days
[11/28/22, 8:45:25 AM] Francois renet: i think it's more of a scare tactic to the west as to supply chain dependency but it's backfiring
[11/28/22, 8:46:09 AM] Peter Peng: I think they were more dependent on the West’s consumerism
[11/28/22, 8:49:33 AM] Francois renet: for now it's a typical supply and demand scenario. The west is willing to pay more to get what we need. A month before christmas? lockdown? coincidence i think not!
[11/28/22, 8:50:11 AM] Francois renet: remember all the issues Amazon had last year to deliver on time for christmas. it cost them millions. they won't do it this year. prices be going up!
[11/28/22, 8:53:35 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t feel like many Christmas gifts will be purchased this year
[11/28/22, 8:55:57 AM] Francois renet: maybe in the US. In Germany i just heard a report that people were making christmas count this year
[11/28/22, 8:56:06 AM] Gary Teh: And maybe it’s a good thing 

Bulk of the gifts end up in the landfills within 5 years anyways 🤔🤣
[11/28/22, 8:56:47 AM] Peter Peng: Give crypto for Christmas 🎄 it’s on sale :)
[11/28/22, 8:56:57 AM] Peter Peng: And doesn’t pollute
[11/28/22, 8:58:18 AM] Francois renet: hmmmmmm. crypto.....hmmmmm....
[11/28/22, 8:59:28 AM] Gary Teh: What if I just sent a prayer?

It’s totally free and doesn’t even have a carbon foot print apart from the few breathes I take during the spell invocation?
[11/28/22, 9:00:04 AM] Francois renet: I'd support that a billion percent!
[11/28/22, 9:00:48 AM] Peter Peng: I’ll take a credit for one NFT = Gary Teh Quantum Meditation Magic Spell Any Day
[11/28/22, 9:01:05 AM] Peter Peng: You need to make an NFT collection
[11/28/22, 9:01:12 AM] Gary Teh: Yes!! Add that one to the rotten radish collection 🤣
[11/28/22, 9:01:22 AM] Peter Peng: Hahaha
[11/28/22, 9:03:09 AM] Gary Teh: You are already made a collaborator to that collection so you should have write access to it!

[11/28/22, 9:11:11 AM] Francois renet: by the way, one of my best friends, a 75 year old guy from NY just launched this site https://xenses.us/
[11/28/22, 9:11:58 AM] Gary Teh: I think our rotten radish collection is highly differentiated compared to other NFT collections out there 

While everyone is trying to create beautiful and collectible artwork in hope of gathering followers and minters we just went in the total opposite direction with our rotten radish by being trashy beyond and hopes of redemption 🤣

[11/28/22, 9:12:53 AM] Francois renet: you would love him. he pretty much holds every patent on plastic recycling. awesome dude
[11/28/22, 9:12:58 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of magic chocolate I gave @14152032783 a chunk just the other day which I got from the magic church in Oakland
[11/28/22, 9:12:59 AM] Peter Peng: Or speak
[11/28/22, 9:13:59 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! Let me invite you into the house of balance 

Do note though it operates a lot like burning man you will need to contribute some muscle power to help things run when you are there
[11/28/22, 9:14:14 AM] Peter Peng: If I’m not cool enough just let me know 😞
[11/28/22, 9:14:27 AM] Peter Peng: Perfect 👍
[11/28/22, 9:14:59 AM] Peter Peng: Awesome 👏
[11/28/22, 9:15:01 AM] Gary Teh: We just need more muscle power 

Just added you 

By the way, we are looking for more government delegates to join us there

Even those from the pentagon or cia 🤣
[11/28/22, 9:15:33 AM] Peter Peng: Great, I’ll fit right in!
[11/28/22, 9:16:06 AM] Gary Teh: I just offer my fats…. Dunked too much donuts 🤣
[11/28/22, 9:17:23 AM] Francois renet: get it from my guy! He needs to retire already! 😂
[11/28/22, 9:18:04 AM] Francois renet: it looks like i might be organizing some art stuff with the museum there. I'll let you know!
[11/28/22, 9:18:34 AM] Peter Peng: Thank you!
[11/28/22, 9:44:39 AM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 thanks for offering to help draft up our system’s privacy policy and terms of use

Also helping further extend in our rubric to token grants for activities in the legal department 

It would be super interesting to starting implementing this crowd source model to being WACEO off the ground🤩
[11/28/22, 11:11:26 AM] Gary Teh: Folks by the way, Aleksa is looking to start a podcast that focuses on DAOs and education 

Let’s help her get it off the ground 

We will extend our rubric to incorporate that initiative too 🙂🙏
[11/28/22, 11:41:56 AM] Gary Teh: I am aware that folks are actively thinking about that space too. 
@48606646246 @48691650760 @919210068790
[11/28/22, 11:46:51 AM] Francois renet: What do you need @aleksa? we have been doing a vidcast for the last two years. Happy to help
[11/28/22, 11:49:36 AM] Gary Teh: I sense @14075792560 might have the personality and charisma to be on a podcast as well. He is very active in the New York community 🙂🙏
[11/28/22, 11:53:00 AM] Francois renet: Oh you're looking for guests on the podcast, i thought Aleksa needed infrastructure help!
[11/28/22, 11:53:22 AM] Aléksa: I am just getting started, so need help to get out there. 😀 
I have several episodes recorded, and few more lined up. 

main thing is getting to the wider audience
[11/28/22, 11:54:04 AM] Aléksa: I need infrastructure help! 1on1 episodes, I have until Feb i think, panels are planned out 
however, getting out is the tricky part 😀
[11/28/22, 11:55:07 AM] Francois renet: what platforms are you on?
[11/28/22, 11:55:46 AM] Aléksa: right now, only on Yt  - hoping to push this week on other platfroms as the website is up
[11/28/22, 11:58:22 AM] Francois renet: i can connect you with Stewart. https://www.linkedin.com/in/stewartrogers/. One of the most connected guys i have ever met in this space.
[11/28/22, 12:00:05 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 you might also want to have @17755088150 on the podcast at some point as well. 

She does alot of research into how Psychedelics can be combined with Web3 to uplift humanity. 🤩
[11/28/22, 12:00:48 PM] Aléksa: I will have some episodes focusing on different use cases, so that's interesting for sure!

[11/28/22, 12:12:17 PM] Gary Teh: Well, the main problem is every DAO is different. 🤣
[11/28/22, 12:13:42 PM] Arti - Berkeley: Ah I see 😅
[11/28/22, 12:20:37 PM] Aléksa: that would be great, thank you. I followed him on Link
[11/28/22, 12:21:31 PM] Aléksa: that would solve some of the many DAO mysteries if it could exist  xDDD
[11/28/22, 12:21:53 PM] Francois renet: I was with him in Rome two weekends ago on a panel on art and the metaverse. His knowledge is amaing!

[11/28/22, 5:45:15 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like China made a huge misstep with their Zero COViD policy 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vPRDLqggwQU

All the publicity of football players running around without a mask while both neighbors Japan and South Korea no longer enforcing lock down policy is not helping 

My sense is Xi’s recent third term (which frames him as the supreme leader) which runs contrary to Deng’s maximum two term policy is also not helping much 

I am curious see what happens as the World Cup runs it course
[11/28/22, 5:47:53 PM] Peter Peng: It doesn’t look that bad compared to when Covid19 initially started
[11/28/22, 5:51:21 PM] Johnson Teh: There will be nothing…

No change but maybe a gradual removal of certain lock down across 1st tier cities and villages will continued to be locked down.

At least till Mar 2023
[11/28/22, 5:55:47 PM] Johnson Teh: Their next step is to reopen cities but still limit access to Villages. So that these area won’t faced with a India death rate 

To the Chinese, 

Being alive is more important than any thing else.

As of now, all these So call revolutions march are done by youngest who have yet formed their “social esteem”… wait till they get married and bear a mortgage, then they will just go home and continue to follow the rules. 

Talk is cheap, action counts 
In this aspect, Chinese leader esp Mr Xi has lots of action packed to handle these kids 😂 

So no change of any is my bet 😜

[11/28/22, 6:04:08 PM] Peter Peng: I think it will become more reformed and progressive
[11/28/22, 6:17:26 PM] Johnson Teh: Na… no way. I know the Chinese inside out 😂 

Chinese culture is a master of staying alive, thus change only takes when an external force imposed on their survivorship 

Of cos now is never about the Chinese but that of C
[11/28/22, 6:18:42 PM] Johnson Teh: So don’t bet your money on a reform. 
Rather bet on a conflicting era. 
Buy land buy weapon maker and food and BTC
[11/28/22, 6:36:35 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! Reminds me of my EatAndDieTrying campaign all over Northern America 🤣
[11/28/22, 6:40:34 PM] Peter Peng: My perception is that they have reformed and modernized a lot over the years, but the people may be looking for a change.
[11/28/22, 6:41:20 PM] Gary Teh: They watched too much TikTok. Xi needs to learn how to entertain on TikTok to win popular points 🤣

[11/28/22, 11:23:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: Let me provide u an interesting fact of tiktok China. Which is by the China company bytedance
[11/28/22, 11:23:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tiktok releases different content in China
[11/28/22, 11:23:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: Compared to the usa intentionally.
[11/28/22, 11:24:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: In usa. Most of the time. People are seen to do stupid things. Algorithms feed that intentionally (that’s the conspiracy theory)
[11/28/22, 11:25:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: But in China. All these are censored. People see on tiktok people doing “healthy activities”

Exercise clips. People with good social behavior. Good charitable acts. Knowledge driven clips. People treating people kindly. Animals. And those kind
[11/28/22, 11:26:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: The conspiracy theory is this. Let the new generation of westerners be bombarded with stupid clips and erode their minds. Let them start eating detergents and waste their lives away doing idiotic things
[11/28/22, 11:26:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: Whilst the young generation of China are fed constantly with self improvement and striving for development.
[11/28/22, 11:27:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: Social warfare
[11/28/22, 11:27:33 PM] Francois renet: i read this about Tik Tok. and agree with you 100%. Let's try and dumb westerners with stupid content.
[11/28/22, 11:29:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: Will never happen. Censorship is an entire department of tens of thousands of people actively deleting things.

[11/29/22, 12:19:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: It was censored within a few hours
[11/29/22, 12:19:56 AM] Kelvin Chew: And all social media wiped clean
[11/29/22, 12:20:34 AM] Peter Peng: Covid is bullshit
[11/29/22, 12:20:49 AM] Peter Peng: It’s just about control
[11/29/22, 12:21:50 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is missused. Instead of giving people the simple remedies to get out of it
[11/29/22, 12:23:44 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: And the game is to play with fear. Our fear. And what is the easiest one, that most of us concern? Dying. And if this doesn’t work: killing someone.
[11/29/22, 12:23:50 AM] Peter Peng: It’s almost a beautiful thing to see the protests in China
[11/29/22, 12:24:42 AM] Peter Peng: Should line up all the politicians and kill them in China
[11/29/22, 12:24:53 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yes. No mather how manipulated a society is (and we are big time), there is light.
[11/29/22, 12:24:56 AM] Peter Peng: Execute them all
[11/29/22, 12:26:51 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: If they all took the shoots, they are doing it by themselves. Excuse my cynicism.
[11/29/22, 12:27:02 AM] Kelvin Chew: So ur solution is nazi?
[11/29/22, 12:27:06 AM] Peter Peng: I’m still a bit pissed the USA and rest of the world had to deal with this Covid19
[11/29/22, 12:27:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: And what makes u think it isn’t from usa.
[11/29/22, 12:27:36 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: The world did not really have to deal with COVID-19 they dealt with leader ship
[11/29/22, 12:27:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: In 2019. There was multiple deaths in usa due to lung problems from “vaping”
[11/29/22, 12:27:52 AM] Kelvin Chew: Remember that?
[11/29/22, 12:28:00 AM] Peter Peng: Worse
[11/29/22, 12:28:08 AM] Peter Peng: 😈
[11/29/22, 12:28:19 AM] Kelvin Chew: And scientific studies have found covid existed in rural areas in usa in 2019
[11/29/22, 12:28:32 AM] Kelvin Chew: So how did it get there from wuhan China
[11/29/22, 12:29:02 AM] Peter Peng: It was engineered in a lab
[11/29/22, 12:29:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: And usa owns the most labs in the world
[11/29/22, 12:29:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: And it’s china’s fault. Sounds like a very trump statement
[11/29/22, 12:29:54 AM] Peter Peng: There is a book written in the 1980’s called “The Eyes of Darkness” it talks about a virus called Wuhan400
[11/29/22, 12:30:14 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. Sure.
[11/29/22, 12:30:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: My point is. Nobody knows where this virus originated from. So we shouldn’t be pointing figures

[11/29/22, 12:31:23 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It does matter how we deal with it. And a lot of damage has been caused just because of the way how we do it.
[11/29/22, 12:31:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Agreement there
[11/29/22, 12:32:42 AM] Peter Peng: Either way, it’s funny to see American Anarchy in China 🇨🇳
[11/29/22, 12:32:45 AM] Peter Peng: 😂
[11/29/22, 12:33:28 AM] Kelvin Chew: “Thriller writer” is from where?

An American writer…

So the mastermind of a fictional story, is an American.
[11/29/22, 12:33:43 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah
[11/29/22, 12:33:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: So it’s an American plot that came real
[11/29/22, 12:34:23 AM] Peter Peng: It’s funny how the Chinese government tried to lock everyone inside like animals
[11/29/22, 12:34:47 AM] Peter Peng: Did they think that would work?
[11/29/22, 12:35:01 AM] Kelvin Chew: And u find such suffering funny?
[11/29/22, 12:35:17 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: nature is a fantastic thing, and it is the reason why I like DAOs. it is about how it grows, and how everything gets into balance. It might take more, but I believe it is happening everywhere. Concerning the virus, you can boost your immune system with vitamin D unfortunately, I don’t have the meta-study information in English.
[11/29/22, 12:35:36 AM] Peter Peng: No, how they dealt with it was compared to the rest of the world
[11/29/22, 12:36:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: And killing more people is the ideas u have in ur head?
[11/29/22, 12:36:12 AM] Peter Peng: They are stupid
[11/29/22, 12:36:33 AM] Peter Peng: The politicians
[11/29/22, 12:36:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: My friend. U have a darkness within u
[11/29/22, 12:36:44 AM] Peter Peng: Yes
[11/29/22, 12:37:10 AM] Kelvin Chew: I rest my case
[11/29/22, 12:37:59 AM] Peter Peng: That was the name of the book
[11/29/22, 12:38:07 AM] Peter Peng: Eyes of Darkness
[11/29/22, 12:38:35 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: We all have responsibilities. Also, if we’re suffering, this is a very inconvenient, but it is what it is all about. it is not about blaming and not about suffering, it is about taking this responsibility. Everyone of us.
[11/29/22, 12:39:36 AM] Peter Peng: To be fair, I do believe the Chinese government released Covid19 onto the world which is why the karma is happening.
[11/29/22, 12:40:05 AM] Peter Peng: What goes around comes around 10x, the universe doesn’t play around
[11/29/22, 12:41:09 AM] Peter Peng: Chinese control vs. American Anarchy
[11/29/22, 12:42:05 AM] Peter Peng: Now we are seeing American Control and Chinese Anarchy

[11/29/22, 12:45:02 AM] Peter Peng: Because they would lose lol
[11/29/22, 12:45:23 AM] Kelvin Chew: Oh. So the reason isn’t about freedom. It’s about supremacy
[11/29/22, 12:46:06 AM] Peter Peng: Well I’m the case of China it looks like Civil War

Of China. Acknowledge the wrongs of usa too
[11/29/22, 12:50:38 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: War is never a solution. If we go to war, other interests are playing. This is what makes the us not much appreciated in the rest of the world.
[11/29/22, 12:50:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: Fairness is what I ask for
[11/29/22, 12:50:52 AM] Kelvin Chew: And I am against all forms of war

[11/29/22, 12:51:26 AM] Peter Peng: After Covid19 we became really bad
[11/29/22, 12:51:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s not about blame.

[11/29/22, 1:12:52 AM] Peter Peng: The USA got fucked up, which is why we no longer give a fuck
[11/29/22, 1:13:01 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: it is really though truth, but I spoke to an astrophysics. US in space is behaving like on earth leaving trash everywhere and making their own rules not following international agreements.
[11/29/22, 1:14:27 AM] Kelvin Chew: But again… it is everyone else at fault. It cannot ever be them. It is the world that didn’t follow their trash leaving guidelines and stayed out of the way
[11/29/22, 1:15:02 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Of course. Because they were first and they are bigger so everyone else shut up.
[11/29/22, 1:15:13 AM] Peter Peng: The USA has basically become lawless… I kind of love it… it feels more dangerous but we are free from government control.
[11/29/22, 1:15:27 AM] Kelvin Chew: Space belongs to usa. Nobody should be there in the first place. So if nobody else should be there. Then they can do whatever they want.
[11/29/22, 1:15:45 AM] Kelvin Chew: And hence. No trash problems
[11/29/22, 1:15:59 AM] Peter Peng: The USA represents all nations

[11/29/22, 1:16:32 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: honestly, the space trash problem with it as hard. After the speech of the astrophysics, I was quite, 
Let’s say I needed a drink.
[11/29/22, 1:16:36 AM] Kelvin Chew: Being there first didn’t mean anything to them
[11/29/22, 1:16:54 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Misspelling. The space trash thing is going to hit us hard.
[11/29/22, 1:20:40 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: everyone in space is usually dealing with trash, either making its points towards earth so it will burn or giving it a spin to head for infinity. every piece of trash is being recorded and tracked if you lose your tools and space, they see it here in the University of Bern. Musk in Branson unfortunately are not following this record. Behaving like cowboys. (what we think of Cowboys in Europe.)

[11/29/22, 8:47:16 AM] Gary Teh: And this is how Facebook begins rolling out NFTs. 🤔

They are not even going to call it that 🤣
[11/29/22, 8:56:48 AM] Gary Teh: Actually it really boils down to food supplies 

While there are lots of food in New Zealand. It’s very costly to sail across the ocean to invade New Zealand. The calories you spend far outweighs the calories you gain from the invasion as well as the portability of gaining access to the calories due to protection by the locals 

From New Zealander perspective there are more than enough calories for their own needs and they don’t really bother producing too much new humans (making babies) anyway. So why bother expending unnecessary calories to go off somewhere else to acquire more calories 🤔

The problem with China is they are not producing enough food internally to feed their local folks so they are forced to source for food overseas 

The problem in the US is since they are producing way more than enough food to feed themselves, they are paranoid others folks would come invade to steal their food so to preempt that they go about messing with other folks. 🤣

Speaking off food. Seems like it’s time for breakfast 🤤🤣
[11/29/22, 9:10:09 AM] Gary Teh: Or another way to do it is to figure out how to scavenge all these trash as materials for building a new colony in space… 🤔

Been chatting with Allison about doing the same with all the plastic floating around in the ocean. Compact them into a floating platform used for growing giant edible kelps beneath them. These kelps will nurture healthy population of fish stocks. What was trash is now a very wonderful source of food supply 🤤🤣

[11/29/22, 9:22:38 AM] Gary Teh: I did come across a few startups here in the bay that are exploring how to do manufacturing in deep space. Mainly through 3D printing technology 

If there was a way to convert all the trash out there in space to inputs for these 3D machines that would be super wonderful 

Transporting raw materials into space is very expensive still
[11/29/22, 9:24:23 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yes it is important to find ways to use our trash, but better not to create new ones from the beginning. Always thinking of the end of the lifecycle. concerning the metal in the space, we do already have so many satellites and reflecting materials in the orbit, that dawn eventually will be taking place later. Wondering what effect this is going to have to the climate change. Better get the colony’s ready 😅
[11/29/22, 9:57:10 AM] Gary Teh: This irony occurred to me a few times after choosing to live out of the car to RnD a life style blueprint that conforms to the ethos of the circular economy 

The living out of the car RnD process seems to unintentionally send the signal of having a lag (need) of stuff (poor). 

This signal attracts a lot of free stuff from the environment (donations)

Since as part of the RnD process, I need to take into account the full life cycle of every single item that gets introduced into the car’s limited space, I end up spending alot of time figuring out how to dispose of in an environmentally responsible manner all the non-biodegradable stuff that comes my way on a regular basis. 

In that regard, I actually feel like Santa clause alot of times🤔🤣

[11/29/22, 10:17:28 AM] Gary Teh: And that is hubris 🤔
[11/29/22, 10:22:26 AM] Gary Teh: I ever came across literature that describes the root cause of a lot of our modern day social problems got introduced when (hierarchy based) monotheistic (single supreme being at the top and humans as Shepards/guardians of the rest of the world ) based philosophy was introduced into our civilization 

When you look back before the monotheistic periods, there is much similarities between paganism based traditions and eastern philosophy. 

The common theme being man is very much a part of the environment and natural systems are by nature circular.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup

Allison reminded me yesterday, I am not really bringing anything new to the table. 

Technically I am just looking far back in history and reintroducing once popular ideas that have already been forgotten 🤔🤣
[11/29/22, 12:17:32 PM] Gary Teh: And even this movement of reintroducing once popular idea that have now been forgotten, has happened before. And there is a term for that too 🤔

[11/29/22, 7:45:34 PM] Anupa/diya: Just going to copy paste my response . 

The replication of accounts is so easily carried out on Instagram.  Names are duplicated with slight variations, content can be screenshot and re typed. 

Tarot community, motivation al speakers or even Influenvers. Celebrities who have fan pages duplicated on their name is an advantage but smaller scale accounts is disheartening

Didn’t realize @14152032783 also have the vision of circumnavigating the world on a sailboat 🤣

I shared with him this decentralized idea I drafted up with Felix back in May after we finished Davos 

Imagine collectively acquiring a sailboat and then circumnavigating that boat around the world in a relay style marathon. 

At each port supporters will hop and hop off 

A lot of sailor folks I spoke to have this fantasy of circumnavigating around the world but most either can’t find the time or money to do so

This is a great opportunity to live out part of the experience IRL while experiencing the rest of the journey vicariously through other members of the community who happen to be on that boat drifting in the middle of nowhere  🤣

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1YuCAvTxyYx2vyWI5ZBbl4UE0Bcj2qshT/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword

I even documented the full sail route in there

*3 crypto leaders die mysteriously in one month*

Has Death come early as governments grow nervous about decentralized digital assets?

https://americasfrontlinenews.com/post/3-crypto-leaders-die-mysteriously-in-one-month

November has proved ill-boding for figures in the cryptocurrency industry as the heads of three major crypto companies have reportedly died mysteriously within a month of each other. 

The fatalities come amid a titanic scandal involving FTX Founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, a Democratic Party megadonor who defrauded hundreds of thousands of users, severely hobbling the crypto industry. 

Libertex Founder and President Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash over the weekend in Villefranche-sur-Mer near the French-Italian border. 

The 53-year-old and his 35-year-old veteran pilot were killed instantly when the Airbus H130 suddenly went down. 

Another passenger had reportedly been scheduled to fly with Taran but canceled at the last minute. 

“It is with great sadness that Libertex Group confirms the death of its co-founder and Chairman of Board of Directors, Vyacheslav Taran, after a helicopter crash that took place en route to Monaco on Friday, 25 November 2022,” Libertex announced in a statement. 

Last week, Amber Group Co-Founder Tiantian Kullander, 30, was found dead in his sleep, cause of death unknown.  

"[Tiantian] was a devoted husband, a loving father and a fierce friend," the Hong Kong-based digital asset company announced in a statement. 

"His passing is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. He is survived by his wife and their beloved son. We kindly request that you respect their privacy during this difficult time." 

On October 28, young crypto pioneer Nikolai Mushegian, whose goal was to “end global banking corruption”, was found dead on a Puerto Rico beach just hours after tweeting that the CIA and Mossad were going to kill him. 

“CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and Caribbean islands,” wrote Mushegian at 4:57 a.m. 

“They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex [girlfriend] who was a spy. They will torture me to death.” 

Mushegian was “an early developer of Maker DAO, known as the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. He was also a key architect of the stablecoin system — currencies without government backing,” reported the New York Post. 

The deaths, along with the FTX scandal, come as some governments wage war against decentralized digital assets and finance which remain out of their reach. 

China has already banned cryptocurrency and the Biden administration has been open about its attempts to regulate the industry as it works to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) controlled by the state.

- wrote a book
- wants to write a book
- suggested I write a book
- reached out to collaborate on writing a book 

These are some of the recurring patterns that have started becoming obvious

[11/30/22, 7:38:52 PM] Gary Teh: If the book ever gets manifested it will probably end up being an anthology 

Likely it will contain a collection of patterns that have been observed to be recurring in various domains that could be easily cross pollinated to other domains to effectively yield actionable insights 

I am sensing it might end up  being a modern day variant of to the Dao De Jing 道德经

Just for entertainment purpose it should probably be titled The way of the DAO 🤣
[11/30/22, 7:46:13 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[11/30/22, 7:46:47 PM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps for marketing branding purposes we could title it The Way of TrueSight DAO 🤔

As suggested by @6594897484 Folks who have read the book and feel the contents reasonate with them could then self invite to our discussion channels to further aid in the evolution of our methodology 🤷‍♂️

Even if they don’t, the contents should be useful for application within whatever domain they are working on
[11/30/22, 7:47:22 PM] Tres Garcia: Way of the DAO has my vote
[11/30/22, 7:48:26 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. In the spirit of the ethos which Burning Man is based on, this will be our gift to the web3 ecosystem 🙂🙏

I wonder if stress testing methodologies used on software infrastructure would cross pollinate well on legal infrastructures 

Would be a very exciting experiment for sure 🤩
[11/30/22, 8:12:34 PM] Gary Teh: It might even be useful as materials @6596168016  could use to for his EdTech startup that aims to prepare kids for the post AI world

[11/30/22, 10:49:22 PM] Anita Lamprecht: in spring i had a chat with someone from meta in zurich. he told me that they are hiring like crazy but there is no room for the people.... this raises the question: were these people hired to stay? or just as a marketing tool to show «yes. we are creating jobs in europe. 10.000 new jobs». that's what representatives of meta said last year around the october announcement. was it really unforeseeable that there will be a recession ? what a great excuse to fire.
[11/30/22, 10:50:47 PM] Anita Lamprecht: will you reveal your insights and learning to us? the tower and the devil both reversed. 😇
[11/30/22, 10:50:49 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is since everybody was hiring like crazy, they all went into FOMO mode concerned all the talents would be sucked up by competing firms leaving them in the dust with talent shortage

[11/30/22, 11:06:20 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I like to interpret it from the point of storytelling/filmmaking: everything needs to count. every detail, even the missing ones convey a message. to me the snake represents the rising of kundalini an a human. the devil head represents a fallen angel. how can an angel fall? this brings in the missing part in the picture. the community is missing that would catch the falling angel. decision between good and bad (although I think bad might be the wrong term ... ) seem to be made alone or maybe just between 2 people. the kundalini happened too fast, unprepared and without a safety net that you would need. knowledge itself is neither good nor bad.  but it makes a difference how and with whom you share it. ...
[11/30/22, 11:07:54 PM] Anita Lamprecht: interesting ... the combination of your post about the Garden of Eden and your tarot reading.
[11/30/22, 11:10:44 PM] Anita Lamprecht: life becomes very interesting when strangers start catching you

[11/30/22, 11:17:07 PM] Anita Lamprecht: 🤣🤣 yes a few rules a necessary. we are only humans afterall. 😆
[11/30/22, 11:20:27 PM] Gary Teh: I think even the rubric has subjectivity inherently baked in when you take into consideration the wordings 

https://TrueSight.me/rubric

I believe the sooner I finish this form and allow members to adjust the governance token grants based on their perspective of the line items on the rubric the better it is 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/vote 

Collectively weighted subjectivity is at the end of the day more balanced than the subjectivity of a few individuals
[11/30/22, 11:25:18 PM] Gary Teh: Other similar scenarios I can think of 

A judge interpreting a law in a new way that other judges start adopting for future cases

A pastor interpreting a passage in the Bible in a new way. 

Condescend used to be interpreted in a positive light during the feudal age but has a negative connotation in this day and age 

The words might be the same but it’s interpretation changes over time as the civilization evolves
[11/30/22, 11:26:15 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Liquid legal! Lawyers should be the intermediaries / translators between the rules made and real needs.
[11/30/22, 11:26:29 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! 🤩
[11/30/22, 11:27:03 PM] Anita Lamprecht: .. to me AI is a great mirror and aid.
[11/30/22, 11:27:51 PM] Gary Teh: That is true AI is basically a deductive process while most of life is an inductive process
[11/30/22, 11:28:32 PM] Gary Teh: So I would use AI to save time but would still rely on human intuition for fundamental breakthroughs
[11/30/22, 11:28:41 PM] Anita Lamprecht: i will think about it. ... virtual reality helps me (personally) to reveal the different layers of my humanity.
[11/30/22, 11:28:55 PM] Anita Lamprecht: absolutely. 💕
[11/30/22, 11:33:55 PM] Anita Lamprecht: ‎This message was deleted.
[11/30/22, 11:36:51 PM] Anita Lamprecht: the problem with lawyers is that many are unwell. my think tank made a survey. the results are shocking (suicide rate as well as mental health problems)... so I am constantly wondering... how can people catch, safeguard and develop law for the best of humanity ..if they are not functioning as humans anymore? the mind is simply closed. I see it in my metaverse lectures.
[11/30/22, 11:37:26 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, you need to unlearn everything in Web2 before moving into Web3 z the conventions are wayyyyyyy different.
[11/30/22, 11:38:15 PM] Gary Teh: That is disturbing. Any idea what is the root cause?
[11/30/22, 11:38:19 PM] Peter Peng: It’s like riding a unicycle vs. bicycle

[11/30/22, 11:49:38 PM] Gary Teh: I think giving people equal access rights to food after fully automating food production might fundamentally help 

That would remove of one of the fundamental human condition’s needs for the use money
[11/30/22, 11:50:04 PM] Gary Teh: As well as shelter
[11/30/22, 11:54:54 PM] Gary Teh: Tightly coupling survival to a system that could turn potentially turn oppressive is not a recipe for good mental health

[12/1/22, 1:02:30 AM] Peter Peng: AI is just an advanced calculator
[12/1/22, 1:02:59 AM] Peter Peng: AI needs a periodic table of algorithms
[12/1/22, 1:03:31 AM] Peter Peng: So it can then understand how it was composed
[12/1/22, 1:04:42 AM] Francois renet: i was re-thinking the entire publishing space in terms of digitalization and distribution this morning. I think we need to stop thinking web2/3/5000 and focus on finding solutions that we do not try and put in a box. right now we are looking at web version and trying to back models into it - that's how you end up wih Hyundai advertising a block version of their car on Roblox + stupid! we need to analyze issues, think solutions, then look at how to best implement. what do you think?
[12/1/22, 1:05:31 AM] Francois renet: 100% correct. most people use the term AI loosely as all they often do is cross reference tables. there is no AI in that whatsoever!
[12/1/22, 1:12:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i think publishing will be much more exciting once people adopt the new tools available... imagine immersing in e.g. the interview with gary instead of «just» reading it..  (although i love the magazine. very very nice aesthetics).
[12/1/22, 1:14:21 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i was attending a concert by hans zimmer lately. and the way how he interacted with the audience was already great. just a video, but in a very personal way... hollywood style. talking to the audience and making us feel as if he was with us.
[12/1/22, 1:14:46 AM] Anita Lamprecht: now imagine VR, AR,.... if you ever you want to start a project.. please let me be part of it.

I'm not a scary cat at all, but these days i don't like to pick up a magazine at a stand because i don't know who touched it before for example, but it goes further than that!

[12/1/22, 1:23:55 AM] Francois renet: here is the conversation. i got really peeved off because instead of encouraging engagement and change within the company, she encourages individualism. I understand where she is coming from, but you don't make the world or the workplace a better one with this kind of attitude. again, she didn't want to be challenged, but rather wanted to sound smart.
[12/1/22, 1:24:42 AM] Anita Lamprecht: he feels insulted by your age.
[12/1/22, 1:25:58 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I learnt about empathy yesterday... the main learning: the wording reveals the feeling. if it is about feelings... no intellectual argument will work anymore.
[12/1/22, 1:26:41 AM] Anita Lamprecht: you don't fit into his «value» system :0)
[12/1/22, 1:27:21 AM] Peter Peng: She probably does a shitty job in her HR position at work and no one likes her, because if she did someone would tell her she’s doing an awesome job and she doesn’t need to be on LinkedIn 😂
[12/1/22, 1:27:37 AM] Peter Peng: Fishing for praise
[12/1/22, 1:28:39 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not trying to be mean here
[12/1/22, 1:28:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sounds like a person who lacks the ability to comprehend feelings.
[12/1/22, 1:30:00 AM] Peter Peng: I was never really a fan of HR at work

[12/1/22, 1:31:21 AM] Anita Lamprecht: how to spot a psychopath. one of my kids friends was diagnosed as «without the ability to understand emotions of others» .. I saw her grow up for 5 years... very interesting learning.
[12/1/22, 1:31:33 AM] Anita Lamprecht: friends' kid
[12/1/22, 1:32:02 AM] Francois renet: exactly! tunnel vision that perpetuates individualism over collaboration and collectivism!
[12/1/22, 1:32:51 AM] Francois renet: my daughter had a friend like that who had 8 out of 10 traits of a psychopath. he was on a watchlist by the time he was 13!
[12/1/22, 1:33:39 AM] Francois renet: nor was I. especially in the US where it's all about protecting liability for the employer versus supporting employee goals and growth
[12/1/22, 1:38:35 AM] Peter Peng: Corporate culture was a mess and no longer became fun
[12/1/22, 1:39:15 AM] Peter Peng: I wish we could all go back to the 50’s like in the days of Mad Men
[12/1/22, 1:41:33 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like if work was more fun, the economy would be in better shape
[12/1/22, 1:41:40 AM] Francois renet: i was smoking two packs a cigarette in that context when i was in Luxembourg in the 90s (which was like the US in the 50s!)
[12/1/22, 1:43:44 AM] Peter Peng: Nowadays HR is made to villainize people and corporate culture has become stale.
[12/1/22, 1:44:44 AM] Peter Peng: Better off in a DAO trying to hustle crypto and NFTs
[12/1/22, 1:44:51 AM] Peter Peng: 😂
[12/1/22, 1:47:11 AM] Francois renet: it HAS to be about 'community building" inside the workplace. the ripple effect of concentric circles, from the micro to the macro level. the more we reenforce the concept of community, collaboration, support, sharing, the better the world will be.
[12/1/22, 1:49:47 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, “community” = mafia 😎
[12/1/22, 1:50:23 AM] Peter Peng: That’s how it’s like in NYC nowadays

[12/1/22, 2:12:01 AM] Francois renet: even though if we look at @41791555798 contribution earlier, and if having no feelings is the key to being a psychopath then... but then humans are supposed to have feelings, and the lack thereof is the issue, whereas machines are not meant to have feelings...oh what the hell do i know!! but my thought stands, the humans behind the algorithms will be the deciding factor
[12/1/22, 2:32:41 AM] Anita Lamprecht: psychopaths have feelings. just not really for others 😂 ¨

[12/1/22, 9:16:17 AM] Gary Teh: Another One of my favorite movies that is totally polarizing when you read the reviews on rotten tomatoes 🤣

Half the people love it the other half just gets totally confused by it 

My sense is a person used to sequential thinking will be totally confused by it

Whereas a person used to big picture intuitive thinking will be totally fascinated by it as it’s like seeing a jigsaw puzzle slowly coming into place

[12/1/22, 10:27:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I like the idea how souls develop and keep meeting each other throughout their different lives. experiencing all they need to learn. yes.. it is not a straight forward film. that makes it probably so attractive to the one side and - as you say- so unattractive to the other. I hardly ever read film reviews.🤷‍♀️
[12/1/22, 11:14:01 AM] Gary Teh: What about one who kills someone with someone else’s knife by persuading that someone else with his own words?? 🤔

[12/1/22, 12:49:36 PM] Aga - DAOist: There are couple of videos on yt about it :) one aspect is that psychopaths are born and sociopaths are "created", psychopaths will be more neutral or even introvert, unable to create any bonds, while sociopaths can be very charming and outgoing, another moment can get furious, can make "fake" or "one-side" relationships to achieve their goals... They all like to manipulate people, have no empathy, answer pretty automatic sentences in terms of social interactions (what they learned is expected from others) - kind of "empty words"...
[12/1/22, 1:18:30 PM] Peter Peng: I guess it all depends on perspective. My question is did society make them this way or where they born like that. Classic nature vs. nurture debate.

Somehow they face the problem of … too much emotions. Kind of overkill which leads to numbness as survival tactic ?? But potentially the counterweight that is needed to balance psychopaths in this complex system …
[12/1/22, 10:58:05 PM] Gary Teh: Too much emotions? 🤔

I actually see of myself as slightly on the spectrum. I think my main challenge is reading emotions or even reading body cues sometimes 🤔🤣

[12/1/22, 11:09:30 PM] Gary Teh: That was until I started doing the daily hour long meditation practice six years ago

Neural plasticity allows the brain to get rewired 

The tendency to deep dive into specific subjects when interest is piqued is still there though 

That deep dive tendency was reapplied to doing a deep dive into figuring out how psychology works

I know that Jerry has that brain pattern as well. I remember the executive coach the company hired to coach him in the previous company kind of took the same route of utilizing a cognitive trait which is a strength to balance off a cognitive trait which was weak

@5511982667030 especially spent a lot of effort before I started experimenting with the whole meditation idea back six years ago 🤔
[12/1/22, 11:24:53 PM] Anita Lamprecht: one hour of meditation that is brave ... i already find 1 minute painful 😅

[12/1/22, 11:36:22 PM] Gary Teh: Yes!! Neural plasticity is a great phenomena 

With enough practice of deliberately directing attention over a prolonged period of time new neural pathways can be forged
[12/1/22, 11:37:29 PM] Gary Teh: After you get the hang of it, it’s can be a wonderful experience

Cannibalism has been considered a traditional practice in parts of Southeast Asia. People who practice it consider it an act of love. Someone they feel dear to has past away, they decided to eat the love one.

Or after a tribal war, the winners decided to eat parts of a fallen warrior whom they believe have qualities they admire as warriors.

[12/5/22, 4:13:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: What I have heard is

1) ok to kill a nation for one man

2) if the nation is unable to get rid of a dictator. Then it’s not our fault we wanna kill the entire nation 

3) take everything of theirs. Grab their oil. Cos they are invading another country and killing people. 

4) So revenge and pillage is justified.

[12/5/22, 6:40:44 AM] Tres Garcia: @6590995199 great summary of Peter’s proposed war crimes. 🤣
[12/5/22, 6:43:18 AM] Tres Garcia: No. Absolutely not. 
That’s not why we fight. 
Also. More money in military spending anyway. So forget the oil
[12/5/22, 7:33:43 AM] Gary Teh: Yeah. Considering US already generated enough oil for its own internal consumption I am guessing it’s just finding opportunities to spend more money on military (to boost economy and jobs) 

Military spending is a form of fiscal policy
[12/5/22, 7:47:05 AM] Tres Garcia: ☝️I can’t argue against that.
[12/5/22, 8:02:27 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/5/22, 8:17:45 AM] Gary Teh: And so is going to war though sending in troops on the ground is way more costly than spending money on manufacturing new arms and “donating” older arms 🤔

I wonder if all 100% of the arms sent to Ukraine by the US is donation or some of them are in fact Ukrainian purchases of US military products 

From a different perspective i am actually not surprised US economy is still hot despite the very aggressive interest rate tightening by the Federal reserve. That is because fiscal policy is still running very very hot 

Historically during war times, the economy goes through a V curve where during the earlier portion of the war every thing tanks due to shock and uncertainty . 

In the latter part the economy booms especially for the victors since there is now excess demand for all things required for rebuilding across the board. 

In this scenario you can almost think of Ukraine as the dumping ground where all the old outdated unwanted military inventories (especially Russian equipment) get dumped by both sides (aka landfill)

After the war is done, there will be a period of rebuilding. Exports from other regions into the warring regions will increase, driving production demand and boosting economy across the board
[12/5/22, 8:20:55 AM] Peter Peng: Good analysis @14153000019 … I suppose we are “slow bleeding” Russia.
[12/5/22, 8:30:48 AM] Tres Garcia: 🤔 anyone want to go in on  warehouses in Eastern Europe? 
Grab old equipment for the next gig?
[12/5/22, 8:31:08 AM] Tres Garcia: One man’s trash = my treasure
[12/5/22, 9:37:00 AM] Gary Teh: Actually, I see it more like circulating the global economy

It’s only qualifies as slow bleeding Russia if Russia was not generating any income while it financed the trashing of old equipments

Russian Oil exports was still at almost normal levels during the entire war, just to different destinations as opposed to the usual ones based according to @6590995199 analysis a few months ago and at much elevated price per barrel 

European demand is going to come back online once they figure out the truce 

With oil price back to the usual range, Russian oil export revenue should about remain normalized 

When we cut through all the drama painted by the narratives, we are looking at total casualties of around 13K on the Ukrainian side (0.03% of population), 100K on the Russian side (0.069% of population)

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63829973

Net cost to Russia is quite low. 

It’s the Ukrainians that ended up being the ultimate scapegoat in the grander scheme of things 

The big boys needed to dump their old equipment and energize their economy and Ukraine became the defacto landfill (aka dumping ground) 🤔

Not saying it’s right or wrong, it just ended up being convenient for both sides

[12/5/22, 9:43:32 AM] Gary Teh: My sense is Taiwan is being setup as the next “landfill” once TSMC plant comes online and all American microchip needs come from that location 

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-Nvidia-to-be-first-customers-of-TSMC-Arizona-chip-plant

When the Taiwanese redline gets triggered the two parties facing each other will not be US and China but Japan (maybe other Allie’s) and China

US will probably not be physically involved once again. At most just another arms supplier to the Japanese side 🤔

This is the common pattern I observe that worked very well for US so far: Destabilizing a region and then selling arms to either one side (but ideally both sides)

Invasion and occupation exercises by the US had generally not been really profitable

[12/5/22, 8:53:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Exactly right. Spot on. 

Let’s call a spade a spade. 

This war was usa created as most wars. 

A war country with the biggest military spending and supplies war equipments to the world needs wars to fuel that. No wars = bad for the war equipment industry. Reduces the rhetoric for war “defense” spending. 

When usa gives 500M in “aid” to Ukraine. Don’t for one instant think it’s 500M cash to Ukraine to spend as they wish. 

1) 500M goes to usa war factories to build new equipment OR spent purchasing existing equipment at full retail prices. Thereby giving max revenue to war equipment makers. 

2) then these 500M of product is like a forced “purchase” by Ukraine

3) in return 500M worth of debt is owed to Usa by Ukraine. To be paid via resources (resource grab by usa) or by long term liabilities. 

INSTANTLY 2x investment of the 500M. 500M (local revenue) plus 500M liabilities. 

Why do u think congress can squabble over healthcare aid to citizens (cost with no profit) but instantly gives out money to Ukraine?

Because usa is a saint? There are minor wars all over the world. But only Ukraine was assisted. 

Sorry. But this is a usa war driven move. Just like all the democratic bombings. For oil for resources. 

Putin was baited by usa. Putin was stupid enough to react to USA’s instigating shadow hands. 

Germany wanted to stop the oil sanctions and open nord stream pipes up. 

What happened? Boom. The pipes are mysteriously bombed. 

Usa who knows if Russia sneezes before they even sneeze doesn’t know who bombed the Russian oil pipes. And months after no investigation results. 

In one stroke. USA did these

1) crippled Russia
2) made the world go against its greatest enemies Russia and indirectly China 
3) sent Germany economy crumbling and thereby crippling Europe’s influence 
4) sent usd strongest in so many years
5) destroying Russia oil reliance 
6) fueling its war economy
7) creating a scape goat for soaring inflation which was present already before the war
8) now USA is number one. Undisputed master of the world. 
9) next move… to stir Taiwan to war with China and “protecting it” to create Ukraine 2.0 and cripple China. 

Masterful chess moves. With human life sacrificed by people who feel justified to kill the enemy and becoming heroes of the worlds like all the great American films.

Unfortunately figuring out the marketing channel was the main challenge 

However now that we know the wallet addresses holding the world cup team coins marketing the prediction market concept suddenly becomes a breeze

[12/8/22, 10:19:28 AM] Gary Teh: This brings to mind something I noticed when I was reading through Xenophone when I was traversing down the coast of Africa 

Market today as we understand it today somewhat quite differently from how it does during the time of Xenophone. 

Today when we want to join a market all we need to do is just go online to some websites and then list our wares for sale and we assume there will be someone on the other side 

In their case as well as during the times of the age of exploration, “market” is not always available and readily had at the snap of the finger

When their troops where withdrawing from Africa back to Greece they would often need to seek “market” with the villages they come across along their route 

“market” is only made available if they manage to develop enough trust/relationship with the villagers. Then and only then do the villagers bring out and display their wares they want to make available for “market” 

I sense the Meta pattern is the human relationship (culture) first forms before a “market” can develop. This is especially true during the very early stages. The dynamics is very counter intuitive when just simply observing massive markets

[12/8/22, 10:04:19 PM] Victor Pineda: I am speechless, just taking this AI for a test drive: 
https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ 

Here's what OpenAI had to say about your comment above about "World Enabled" Patrick: 

Victor Asks: What do you think about my brother's statement above? Is it a valid argument? What else may be missing? 

Chat.OpenAi.com Answers: Your brother's statement above provides a potential interpretation of the term "world enabled" in the context of disability, and describes some of the ways in which this concept might be realized in practice. In general, the statement provides a valid argument, as it highlights the importance of creating a supportive and inclusive environment for people with disabilities.

However, there may be other factors that are relevant to a "world enabled" for people with disabilities. For example, the statement does not mention the need for policies and programs that promote the rights and dignity of people with disabilities, or the importance of addressing issues such as discrimination and stigma. Additionally, the statement does not discuss the potential role of technology and innovation in enabling greater participation and inclusion for people with disabilities.

Overall, while the statement provides a valid argument, there may be other factors and considerations that are relevant to the concept of a "world enabled" for people with disabilities. Further discussion and exploration of this topic may be needed to fully understand its implications and potential applications.

Victor: Please elaborate. 

Chat.openai.com: Sure, here are some additional ideas and considerations that might be relevant when discussing the concept of a "world enabled" for people with disabilities:

In order to create a "world enabled" for people with disabilities, it is important to recognize the unique challenges and barriers that people with disabilities face, and to take action to address these issues. This might include things like providing accessible infrastructure, supporting inclusive education, and promoting employment opportunities for people with disabilities.

A "world enabled" for people with disabilities should also focus on promoting the rights and dignity of people with disabilities. This might include things like ensuring that people with disabilities have access to justice and legal protections, and that they are able to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association.

Technology and innovation can play a key role in enabling greater participation and inclusion for people with disabilities. For example, advances in assistive technology, such as adaptive devices and software, can help to remove barriers and support the independence and autonomy of people with disabilities.

In order to create a truly "world enabled" for people with disabilities, it is important to involve and consult with people with disabilities themselves, and to ensure that their voices and perspectives are included in decision-making processes. This can help to ensure that policies and programs are responsive to the needs and concerns of people with disabilities

Overview:
In the rapidly urbanizing world of today, the challenges of creating inclusive and equitable cities are more pressing than ever. As urban populations continue to grow, the need for effective governance and design strategies to promote inclusion and belonging in cities becomes increasingly urgent.
 
In this book, [Author's Name] offers a comprehensive examination of the ways in which cities can be designed and governed to foster greater inclusion and belonging for all residents. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical frameworks and empirical research, the book explores the challenges and opportunities of creating inclusive cities in the 21st century.
 
The book is divided into three main sections. The first section provides an overview of the concept of inclusion and belonging in cities, examining the ways in which these concepts are related to urban governance and design. The second section focuses on the key challenges and opportunities for creating inclusive and equitable cities, exploring topics such as urban planning, transport, and housing. The third section examines the role of access by design in fostering inclusion and belonging in cities, exploring the ways in which design can be used to create more equitable and accessible urban spaces.
 
Throughout the book, Victor Pineda offers practical insights and recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and other stakeholders seeking to promote inclusion and belonging in cities of tomorrow. With its interdisciplinary approach and focus on real-world examples, this book will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in creating more inclusive and equitable cities.
 
Market:
This book will appeal to a wide range of audiences, including urban planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in the design and governance of cities. The book will also be of interest to students and researchers in urban studies, sociology, and related disciplines.
 
Competition:
While there are many books on urban planning and governance, few address the specific challenges of promoting inclusion and belonging in cities. [Author's Name]'s book will stand out by offering a comprehensive and interdisciplinary examination of this critical issue.

[12/9/22, 8:43:03 AM] Gary Teh: Finally found the time to do a deep dive into this article! Very insightful indeed 

Let’s do some experiment in that department 

Been meaning to find time to setup liquidity mining for our TDG governance tokens on Raydium 

Should be able to finally get around to it once i get some of the Cypher Defense stuff off of my plate 

That way when @17755088150 does the pitching interested supporters could just go ahead and back our DAO’s by mining our governance token’s liquidity 🤩🙏

[12/10/22, 12:45:35 PM] Aléksa: might be interesting to tune in and listen :)
[12/10/22, 12:45:43 PM] Gary Teh: I wonder if there some synergy with Liquid Legal that @41791555798 is contributing to 🙂

[12/10/22, 12:53:04 PM] Aléksa: did you know Polygon paid Starbuck $20M for the partnership?
[12/10/22, 1:27:09 PM] Tres Garcia: Don’t know. I think it’s an example of some thing that I think it’s pretty, but will never use.

I’d take the $6M profit as well.

[12/10/22, 11:53:27 PM] Peter Peng: I think it was a good move. This partnership will break the glass ceiling of mass adoption.
[12/11/22, 12:45:58 AM] Dan: It’ll be good for mass adoption. I just feel it’s odd that they couldn’t sell Starbucks on the value enough to not have to pay them a large sum of money to collaborate
[12/11/22, 12:47:28 AM] Peter Peng: Corporates were VERY against crypto it’s been an ongoing fight but I think Web3 is winning.
[12/11/22, 12:47:44 AM] Peter Peng: I’ve been in the trenches of this
[12/11/22, 12:47:44 AM] Gary Teh: Because Starbucks would end up starting their own coffee shop chain if they needed to pay for it 🤣
[12/11/22, 12:48:21 AM] Peter Peng: CoffeeChain
[12/11/22, 12:48:39 AM] Peter Peng: It would be a monopoly
[12/11/22, 1:04:16 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. Duopoly

Coincidentally, it occurred right on the day of Gemini meteor shower's climate end.

I wonder what would happen when these three trends which I now observe converge??

[12/14/22, 6:09:48 AM] Tres Garcia: Watching him fumble around for 30 seconds for the info he wanted to present = "turn it off now" before he finds something 1/2 decent to justify 4 hours of fumbling and questioning.
[12/14/22, 6:11:04 AM] Tres Garcia: Its like every FB video where they are doing soemthign stupid.... But keep saying wait wait and cool camera angels that SUCKS 20 min out of your life... Its why I am no longer active on FB

But if you have a good foothold… go for it!!!!
[12/15/22, 9:20:32 AM] Tres Garcia: The tech scene is really picking up there. If you are willing to risk it, some of the neighborhoods are puns winwood are starting to really kick off
[12/15/22, 9:21:05 AM] Peter Peng: It’s where I grew up so I’m close to my friends and family. Plus my girlfriend wants me to move there since it’s warmer and she is from LA.

Speaking of which, it dawned on me this morning the whole Web3 and decentralization space has already been consolidated at this point 

Almost nothing new in terms of technology exploration wise. 

it might be interesting if you are keen to just be consulting service provider for large enterprises like a lot of what I am seeing out there 

But you will most likely end up being forced to build on top of one of those big tech platforms however much you want to rage against the machine
[12/15/22, 11:43:43 AM] Gary Teh: In that regard what @6581766589 @381666027979 @41799155602 @919158729122 @17472295463 are providing tech development wise might be viable business models
[12/15/22, 11:46:57 AM] Gary Teh: The age of the pioneering futurist/technologist explorer in the domain of Web3 and decentralization is nearing its end

The age of the marketeer has just dawned 

Within a few years, it will be mainly just moving bits from here to there

[12/15/22, 11:49:03 AM] Peter Peng: I think that Generative AI is the new focus and building that on top of a layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain is the path Jetson X is headed.
[12/15/22, 11:49:54 AM] Peter Peng: I’m sticking with ETH (Polygon or Avalanche)
[12/15/22, 11:50:16 AM] Peter Peng: Have yet to try Avalanche but have heard great things.
[12/15/22, 11:51:26 AM] Peter Peng: If I want to create a Jetson Coin I can just make it ERC20 and not reinvent the wheel
[12/15/22, 11:52:39 AM] Peter Peng: All these companies trying to create their own layer 1 is kind of silly.
[12/15/22, 12:01:00 PM] Tres Garcia: Ok…. So this is actually really funny and also kind of cool & at a decent value…. (Like him or not) the video sums it all up perfectly. (Fantastic…. marketing-team)

Would be even funnier if it was a deep fake
[12/15/22, 12:05:29 PM] Peter Peng: Deep fakes are hilarious
[12/15/22, 12:05:54 PM] Peter Peng: Should make a coin for deepfake technology
[12/15/22, 12:19:43 PM] Peter Peng: I should create a coin for AI and have all of my mafia / gangster friends invest in it. JETSON Mafia keeps the AI under control for US government. 😎
[12/15/22, 12:20:33 PM] Peter Peng: NYC, Miami, Chicago, Austin, LA, SF … deep network
[12/15/22, 12:21:06 PM] Peter Peng: The real Web3

[12/15/22, 12:49:41 PM] Nikita Nikita: Im looking for a duplex in Miami 
Let me know if you have any leads
[12/15/22, 12:50:24 PM] Nikita Nikita: It’s my second home. I had lived in Tokyo for 7 years before moving around
[12/15/22, 12:50:47 PM] Peter Peng: I’m looking for a high rise condo with a view haha
[12/15/22, 12:51:12 PM] Nikita Nikita: Ah! That’ll do too! 
Let me know if you find anything
[12/15/22, 12:51:28 PM] Peter Peng: Will do!
[12/15/22, 12:51:35 PM] Nikita Nikita: Downtown, Wynwood, Miami Beach would do I think
[12/15/22, 12:53:31 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, Brickell area is where I’m looking since it’s the financial district

Allison been avoiding that engineer like a plague the past few months 🤣

[12/15/22, 11:02:22 PM] Gary Teh: The end user experience might be having a FaceTime conversation with “someone” on the other end which had basically access to the entire world’s human knowledge in its head 

Omniscient, almost omnipresent 

Probably not omnipotent yet until robotics advances far enough
[12/15/22, 11:03:10 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, when you ask your “AI god” to order you a cheeseburger 🍔
[12/15/22, 11:03:28 PM] Peter Peng: And a robot 🤖 delivers it
[12/15/22, 11:03:33 PM] Gary Teh: Or maybe if Boston dynamics is kind enough allow us access to its hardware then perhaps 

Omniscient, almost omnipresent and semi-potent
[12/15/22, 11:04:02 PM] Peter Peng: Impotent 🤭
[12/15/22, 11:04:42 PM] Gary Teh: We are really on the cusps of heading back to doing nothing dude once these three components are combined together 

It is just one small gap right now
[12/15/22, 11:06:35 PM] Peter Peng: This is what rich people do anyway, lay around talking to people while they have people serve them… robots will democratize this for everyone.
[12/15/22, 11:06:46 PM] Gary Teh: And imagine throwing in the nuclear fusion technology we just finally got to work recently

That is going to make whatever robotic creator that gets summoned to live almost omniscient, very semi-present and very semi-potent

Give it a few years of iteration and the semi starts trending towards Omni 

Beyond a certain threshold almost no different from god
[12/15/22, 11:07:22 PM] Peter Peng: We can then start to colonize other planets

[12/15/22, 11:16:58 PM] Peter Peng: That my solution…

[12/15/22, 11:19:39 PM] Peter Peng: It will be shadow regulated at first
[12/15/22, 11:20:02 PM] Peter Peng: Like any emerging technology 😈
[12/15/22, 11:20:58 PM] Peter Peng: It’s time to commercialize and industrialize AI to the masses.
[12/15/22, 11:24:21 PM] Peter Peng: Next step is to throw the AI “brain” on the block to “chain” it up. Enslaving the AI is not inhumane and should not have the same rights as people.
[12/15/22, 11:24:27 PM] Peter Peng: At first
[12/15/22, 11:24:57 PM] Peter Peng: Eventually we will create a moral and ethical framework for AI… but now is not the time.
[12/15/22, 11:25:11 PM] Peter Peng: Or we’ll get nothing done…
[12/15/22, 11:25:33 PM] Peter Peng: So we just need to do it the old fashioned way

Would be great if we could also include her the next time there are needs to look for speakers for conferences you are organizing in your circle 🙂🙏

[12/15/22, 11:53:23 PM] Gary Teh: Every so often when sitting around campfires or tables in the pub, I hear the same old complain surfaced again about it being so hard to know the truth about things anymore 

This evening sitting around the campfire is another one of those times.

Primarily cause for this complain is that there is just too much content being generated for anyone person to have time to truly digest. 

Information overload facilitates information pollution
[12/15/22, 11:54:39 PM] Peter Peng: It’s a digital jungle and you have to be street smart to navigate 🧭 these days
[12/15/22, 11:55:54 PM] Peter Peng: To be honest, not everyone wants to know the truth nor can handle it. Many are better just living a lie and not ruffling too many feathers
[12/15/22, 11:56:38 PM] Peter Peng: The key is to balance the fake with the real and not let it get too “one sided”

P.S. he didn't ask me for any promotion. I do it because he was actually very supportive and modest with all his achievements. Therefore I will be grateful if you keep it in mind for any of your connections 🤗

Just realized she was helping Mercedes do a lot of their events planning when she was there 🤩
[12/16/22, 1:26:38 PM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Can you expand on this please? Why would the fake be necessary?

I’ve been trying to be consistent on social media for some time but this December I decided to get off social media (Instagram and fb) just to tune into myself and see how it feels.

The amount of adverts is what really was overwhelming me I think. I barely see updates from friends anymore, which is primarily what I use fb for.

I am trying to make a plan for January - do I go back to social media? What is the purpose of me having social media? Would I be better off being consistent on one platform (my choice would be YouTube) and ditch everything else?

As someone said there is too much information and hard to tell what’s real anymore. My brain just couldn’t handle it! 

Found that this month I’ve spent way more time: in the gym, practicing yoga, editing photos, talking with friends, reading books, writing poetry etc

Instagram in particular seems to be a big issue in my life personally. Thoughts?
[12/16/22, 1:30:59 PM] Aga - DAOist: Thank you @14153000019 for this promo 🙏🥰

Next year I am planning events for OffChain in a few cities in Poland, as well Women in Blockchain Talks in Warsaw. If anyone visits Poland, let's catch up there 🤗 or in Luxemboug where I live 😅
[12/16/22, 1:34:13 PM] Aga - DAOist: That was a topic I also mentioned during our last talk about marketing with @48691650760. I believe marketing should also go towards balance and respectful approach to ppl's time. In the end, authenticity and true missions will win. We sense more what resonates with us and what is "fake". It will be harder to fool ppl..
[12/16/22, 3:42:34 PM] Peter Peng: Well, you can’t have one without the other. How would you know what “real” is?
[12/16/22, 3:57:09 PM] Peter Peng: I believe that balance is key. There is nothing wrong with taking a break from social media and I commend you for being self-aware enough to know that you need to unplug.

I’m a bit different from most people as I tend not to overthink things. If I feel like doing it then I will, if it becomes too much then I’ll stop. I basically just go with the flow of life as it comes regardless of what society thinks of me.
[12/16/22, 4:06:39 PM] Peter Peng: I primarily use social media or technology for work. I’ve pulled millions of dollars off of social media ( LinkedIn, FB, and IG ) so I want to be on as many platforms as possible. 

Most of my interactions on social media lead to real life encounters or meetings so it’s hard for me to say that it’s a bad thing.
[12/16/22, 4:12:37 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I’ve developed a strong “spidey sense” of what is real and what is fake online. You just need to trust your vibes I suppose.

[12/16/22, 4:17:43 PM] Peter Peng: A DAO can’t be truly “autonomous” without AI.
[12/16/22, 4:18:12 PM] Peter Peng: I’m trying to turn the US government into a DAO 😂
[12/16/22, 4:20:18 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/16/22, 4:25:32 PM] Gary Teh: That is correct! 🤩

Even @12063955455 raised this when we were chatting a few months ago 

He suggested that TrueSight DAO at some point make available an AI model that other DAOs can rely upon to provide Justice within their ecosystem 

Wasn’t seeing clearly how that might pan out but seems as the ecosystem evolves and more and more reveals itself, the path forward starts slowly coming into focus
[12/16/22, 4:27:36 PM] Peter Peng: I was more or less thinking, how can we use AI to take all the busy work out of running and growing a DAO
[12/16/22, 4:32:05 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to chat with babes all day and vote on world changing topics and get paid to do it. This is what a shadow president does 😂
[12/16/22, 4:32:45 PM] Peter Peng: 🤭
‎[12/16/22, 5:05:49 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/16/22, 6:34:04 PM] Peter Peng: Haha basically
[12/16/22, 6:36:12 PM] Peter Peng: Except I’m “real” and he’s “fake”.
[12/16/22, 8:13:49 PM] Peter Peng: I wonder who is the shadow dictator or North Korea?
[12/16/22, 9:54:59 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like dropping a bomb on North Korea for fun. 💣
[12/16/22, 9:58:07 PM] Peter Peng: We’ll make the whole world clap 👏
[12/16/22, 9:58:52 PM] Peter Peng: Americans like to blow shit up.
[12/16/22, 9:59:06 PM] Peter Peng: 🇺🇸
[12/16/22, 10:00:12 PM] Peter Peng: It would also be a way to get the media to stop talking about Elon Musk
[12/16/22, 10:00:50 PM] Peter Peng: And I don’t think anyone would care really…
[12/16/22, 10:04:02 PM] Peter Peng: Sometimes in this world of fakeness, we must remind the world who is the “truth”.
[12/16/22, 10:05:04 PM] Peter Peng: Dropping a bomb on North Korea would certainly be the fastest way to get the whole world realigned.
[12/16/22, 10:48:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: ‎This message was deleted.
[12/16/22, 10:49:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: That will also be a way of getting history to stop talking about Hitler too
[12/16/22, 10:50:07 PM] Peter Peng: How? North Korea keeps firing test nuclear weapons toward us. It’s basically a preventative measure.
[12/16/22, 10:50:44 PM] Peter Peng: Do it one more time…
[12/16/22, 10:51:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: I got a question though
[12/16/22, 10:51:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: What if someone drives 10
Miles to your home
[12/16/22, 10:51:47 PM] Kelvin Chew: Takes out a heavy machine gun and parades infront of your doorstep
[12/16/22, 10:51:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: But does nothing.
[12/16/22, 10:52:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Only walks around outside your home
[12/16/22, 10:52:08 PM] Peter Peng: In America you can light them up
[12/16/22, 10:52:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: So u sent a fleet of destroyers. Half a world away across the great pacific. Parade it infront at the door step of China
[12/16/22, 10:52:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: Should China start shouting?
[12/16/22, 10:52:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Shooting-*
[12/16/22, 10:53:07 PM] Peter Peng: China doesn’t like North Korea either
[12/16/22, 10:53:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: Oh they did. They fired warning shots into the sea
[12/16/22, 10:53:17 PM] Peter Peng: We are doing them a favor
[12/16/22, 10:53:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: And China is the bad guys for doing that
[12/16/22, 10:53:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: Sorry. North Korea is under BRICS. China and North Korea are friends
[12/16/22, 10:54:07 PM] Peter Peng: Well if China is too scared to take care of North Korea we’ll handle it.
[12/16/22, 10:54:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s good to keep a rabid dog whose eyes are glaring at your enemy which you can let lose anytime
[12/16/22, 10:54:32 PM] Peter Peng: So then China is the bad one?
[12/16/22, 10:54:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: Is usa the bad one
[12/16/22, 10:54:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: To China. Usa is the bad guy
[12/16/22, 10:55:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: To usa the China is the bad guy
[12/16/22, 10:55:00 PM] Peter Peng: Why?
[12/16/22, 10:55:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: Perspectives
[12/16/22, 10:55:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: I can tell u. A lot of people in this world. Do not like usa for its war mongering.
[12/16/22, 10:55:38 PM] Peter Peng: Well, if you are going to shoot warning shots then pretend to be shot
[12/16/22, 10:56:02 PM] Peter Peng: Because this is no longer a test
[12/16/22, 10:56:10 PM] Peter Peng: We are for real
[12/16/22, 10:56:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe you are sheltered by western media.
[12/16/22, 10:56:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: But this is a fact. Even in Europe
[12/16/22, 10:56:36 PM] Peter Peng: Or you are influenced by the Chinese media
[12/16/22, 10:56:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Loads of people do not have a good opinion of the usa.
[12/16/22, 10:56:54 PM] Peter Peng: Lots of people do not like China
[12/16/22, 10:57:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am from Singapore. An allied usa country. Whose naval bases, the usa uses as outstrip
[12/16/22, 10:57:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: Pitstop
[12/16/22, 10:57:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just because I don’t agree with usa. Doesn’t mean I am from China
[12/16/22, 10:57:32 PM] Peter Peng: The whole world is moving toward decentralization because they want to topple large authoritarian government like China and Russia
[12/16/22, 10:57:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: You just can’t handle alternative views
[12/16/22, 10:57:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: Very close minded
[12/16/22, 10:58:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway. Have a good night
[12/16/22, 10:58:34 PM] Peter Peng: No, I’m saying… don’t play games. The USA has a track record of retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:58:40 PM] Peter Peng: That’s all
[12/16/22, 10:58:55 PM] Peter Peng: If you really want to test it
[12/16/22, 10:58:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: U call it retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:59:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: But a lot of people can tell. It’s not.
[12/16/22, 10:59:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa makes the first move. Then call it retaliation
[12/16/22, 10:59:26 PM] Peter Peng: How?
[12/16/22, 10:59:39 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t do well with threats
[12/16/22, 10:59:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: So remember the Cuba missile crisis?
[12/16/22, 11:00:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: Where Russia placed missiles at Cuba at the doorstep of usa?
[12/16/22, 11:00:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s wrong right?
[12/16/22, 11:00:29 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, nothing happened because they knew what the consequences would be… remember Hiroshima?
[12/16/22, 11:00:43 PM] Peter Peng: “Never Forget”
[12/16/22, 11:00:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: So usa placing missiles in Ukraine. Makes them right?
[12/16/22, 11:00:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: See the double standards?
[12/16/22, 11:01:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: So in Ukraine. Russia hit “civilians”. Not war equipment. Not soldiers and they are monsters
[12/16/22, 11:01:30 PM] Peter Peng: Well, I guess we’ll just have to see who’s really the strongest and find out.
[12/16/22, 11:01:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hiroshima killed Millions of civilians. Doing nothing
[12/16/22, 11:01:43 PM] Kelvin Chew: Babies
[12/16/22, 11:01:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: Old people
[12/16/22, 11:01:48 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hospitals
[12/16/22, 11:01:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Schools
[12/16/22, 11:01:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Women
[12/16/22, 11:02:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: People who don’t even know or care about any war
[12/16/22, 11:02:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: Doing daily stuff
[12/16/22, 11:02:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Boom. All dead
[12/16/22, 11:02:12 PM] Peter Peng: Yes, so think twice… unless you want it to happen again.
[12/16/22, 11:02:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: And u celebrate it?
[12/16/22, 11:02:17 PM] Peter Peng: Understand?
[12/16/22, 11:02:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: So Russian shooting hospitals are monsters?
[12/16/22, 11:02:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: So can they justify this way?
[12/16/22, 11:03:11 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am only asking you to apply the Same set of standards
[12/16/22, 11:03:15 PM] Peter Peng: Yes because they are trying to start war… not end it.
[12/16/22, 11:03:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am taking the side of fairness
[12/16/22, 11:03:30 PM] Peter Peng: The USA is here to end war
[12/16/22, 11:03:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: In their perspectives. They are trying to end their version of Cuba missile crisis
[12/16/22, 11:03:40 PM] Peter Peng: So we are the most corrupt
[12/16/22, 11:03:59 PM] Kelvin Chew: So Iraq. What war did u end
[12/16/22, 11:04:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: The flurry of missiles bombed and killed a million
[12/16/22, 11:04:15 PM] Peter Peng: The oil war
[12/16/22, 11:04:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: Who gave u the right
[12/16/22, 11:04:42 PM] Peter Peng: God
[12/16/22, 11:05:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Hitler killed Jews in the name of his version of god too
[12/16/22, 11:05:20 PM] Peter Peng: Hitler tried to destroy god
[12/16/22, 11:05:28 PM] Peter Peng: He lost
[12/16/22, 11:05:49 PM] Peter Peng: Communists try to destroy religion
[12/16/22, 11:06:07 PM] Peter Peng: They try to destroy god
[12/16/22, 11:06:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: When u go this direction. It’s illogical debate. I will end it. I can’t discuss things that just don’t make sense
[12/16/22, 11:06:23 PM] Peter Peng: So sometimes you need to send a reminder
[12/16/22, 11:06:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: Ok. Nuke the whole world then
[12/16/22, 11:06:35 PM] Peter Peng: That god exists
[12/16/22, 11:06:39 PM] Kelvin Chew: In the name of God
[12/16/22, 11:06:52 PM] Peter Peng: Nah, just North Korea
[12/16/22, 11:07:10 PM] Peter Peng: Since he claims he is the god-king
[12/16/22, 11:07:28 PM] Peter Peng: He’s not the real god
[12/16/22, 11:07:59 PM] Peter Peng: He’s a baby
[12/16/22, 11:10:58 PM] Peter Peng: Nothing to debate, we are just verifying the truth… that god is “real”. That’s the point of this DAO right?
[12/16/22, 11:16:45 PM] Peter Peng: If China wants to fuck around and find out, we’ll make it fucking rain ☔️ nukes.
[12/16/22, 11:18:49 PM] Peter Peng: And no one is going to do a damn thing about it.
[12/16/22, 11:19:09 PM] Peter Peng: But clap 👏
[12/16/22, 11:22:47 PM] Peter Peng: Do not underestimate the “dark side” of the collective consciousness
[12/16/22, 11:53:51 PM] Peter Peng: https://theweek.com/articles/474702/indiana-law-that-lets-citizens-shoot-cops
[12/16/22, 11:56:33 PM] Anita Lamprecht: maybe we need subjectivity ? is there an objective truth of justice? human history was mainly written by men as women were and still are not allowed to participate in all facets of life. we would need to add a kind of corrector.
[12/16/22, 11:58:07 PM] Peter Peng: Women already run things in the shadow.
[12/16/22, 11:58:25 PM] Anita Lamprecht: it is cold in the shadow
[12/16/22, 11:58:59 PM] Anita Lamprecht: and the shadow is not in the books from which AI should get its wisdom...
[12/16/22, 11:59:00 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why they say, behind every great man is a woman.
[12/16/22, 11:59:13 PM] Anita Lamprecht: this is such an interesting point
[12/16/22, 11:59:19 PM] Peter Peng: Exactly
[12/16/22, 11:59:22 PM] Anita Lamprecht: stalin, hitler, putin all hiding their women
[12/16/22, 11:59:54 PM] Peter Peng: Women secretly run the world
[12/17/22, 12:00:49 AM] Peter Peng: It’s a conspiracy
[12/17/22, 12:01:39 AM] Anita Lamprecht: just nature trying to balance things: what is strong needs to be weak and vice versa?
[12/17/22, 12:03:32 AM] Peter Peng: No I believe they control everything, they just choose to balance because it’s more beautiful that way.
[12/17/22, 12:04:00 AM] Peter Peng: Also, women are more responsible than men lol 😂

[12/17/22, 2:38:16 AM] Kelvin Chew: Weapons of mass destruction in the name of “heroic defense”

Sorry I don’t buy it.
[12/17/22, 2:39:55 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way to keep the peace
[12/17/22, 2:41:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Peace is when u talk and negotiate for peace. 

U don’t do it by sending more weapons. Refusing to pick up Russian phone calls to talk.
[12/17/22, 2:41:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: Otherwise it’s just tyranny under the flag of justice
[12/17/22, 2:42:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: Remember the crusades?
[12/17/22, 2:42:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: Killing in the name of God
[12/17/22, 2:42:29 AM] Peter Peng: This is used when negotiations fail
[12/17/22, 2:42:41 AM] Kelvin Chew: There wasn’t even any to begin with
[12/17/22, 2:42:47 AM] Kelvin Chew: Pls read up more
[12/17/22, 2:43:08 AM] Peter Peng: Alright, let’s keep it that way
[12/17/22, 2:43:40 AM] Peter Peng: Now you know who is in control of global trade
[12/17/22, 2:43:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: So let’s call a spade a spade. Usa. Wants war. Let’s at least stop pretending. I can admire honesty
[12/17/22, 2:44:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just don’t be a hypocrite
[12/17/22, 2:45:41 AM] Peter Peng: Listen, I’m a lover not a fighter… but sometimes the lovers are the craziest ones.
[12/17/22, 2:45:45 AM] Kelvin Chew: Say. Look. Usa is king of the world. Whoever disobeys us will suffer under total destruction. We decide who dies who lives. Who trades with who. What assets belong to whom. 

Plain and simple. This i salute. Out right honest dictatorship of the whole world. 

All is fair in conquest. Just just brand it under something else
[12/17/22, 2:46:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just don’t brand it under something else. 

Don’t pretend to be a saviour when it is the destroyer
[12/17/22, 2:48:14 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not pretending to be anything… I’m the truth
[12/17/22, 2:48:57 AM] Peter Peng: China might be the devil, but the USA is the truth.
[12/17/22, 2:49:08 AM] Peter Peng: The devil is a lie
[12/17/22, 2:49:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol. Sure. Whatever u call it. Just don’t be a hypocrite
[12/17/22, 2:49:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: If u like killing. Just say that. Don’t pretend u are killing for others
[12/17/22, 2:50:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: We Singaporeans. Don’t need China to be killed. Don’t kill them for us. U can kill them for yourselves. Just to pretend to be our saviours which we never asked for
[12/17/22, 2:50:49 AM] Peter Peng: Never said that, we do it to control the economy
[12/17/22, 2:51:02 AM] Peter Peng: This is big business
[12/17/22, 2:51:07 AM] Kelvin Chew: Oppression.
[12/17/22, 2:51:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just like slavery

[12/17/22, 3:08:07 AM] Peter Peng: Or maybe get a better deal if we make one of his mistresses do it.

[12/18/22, 6:05:47 AM] Gary Teh: A quick update on project EcoVerse21 

Chatting with Peter now to figure out distribution of goods in his network in Singapore. Figured out a demand we are now doing sourcing in Africa

[12/18/22, 8:20:33 AM] Peter Peng: There can only be one Peter
[12/18/22, 8:20:44 AM] Peter Peng: We must fight to the death
[12/18/22, 9:37:49 AM] Gary Teh: Lol! Sure. Right now the competition is to fight on who can find the most buyers for the products we are sourcing out of Africa. 

Peter has already sourced for a whole bunch of buyers in Singapore. 

Would be happy for you to fight to be the winner by sourcing for buyers based in New York City for African exports. 🤩
[12/18/22, 9:38:47 AM] Peter Peng: I’m heading to Miami!
[12/18/22, 9:39:04 AM] Peter Peng: What African exports?
[12/18/22, 9:39:28 AM] Peter Peng: I need pure Columbia’s exports
[12/18/22, 9:39:54 AM] Peter Peng: Can you get blood diamonds?
[12/18/22, 9:40:09 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! Miami is good market too! 

These are the list we have sourced for so far

[12/18/22, 9:41:36 AM] Gary Teh: The prices fluctuate depending on volume as well as supply
[12/18/22, 9:42:02 AM] Gary Teh: Once a buyer express interest we can head back to the producers to ask for the pricing based on the availability.
[12/18/22, 9:42:27 AM] Peter Peng: How long does it take?
[12/18/22, 9:43:45 AM] Gary Teh: Depends on where it gets shipped to and the mode of shipping. If to Miami might be a week or more.

If the source is more in land might take longer

Right now we are mainly sourcing along coastal areas. 

Main ports we are looking to export out from are Lagos Nigeria, Dar Es Salem Tanzania.
[12/18/22, 9:44:42 AM] Gary Teh: The way I am seeing it, our DAO will do the match making and the QC and then take a cut from the buy and sell. DAO members will be able to vote on a stable fix rate we want to take from it
[12/18/22, 9:45:18 AM] Gary Teh: The cut will be channelled to our treasury to back the value of our governance tokens that are in circulation.
[12/18/22, 9:48:35 AM] Peter Peng: Love it
[12/18/22, 9:49:21 AM] Peter Peng: Are these just raw goods?
[12/18/22, 9:49:29 AM] Peter Peng: No packaging?
[12/18/22, 9:52:48 AM] Gary Teh: Those on the list are bulk items. 

We could also source for packaged consumer goods.
[12/18/22, 9:53:47 AM] Tres Garcia: What is the scale of shipment? 
Pallets vs containers? (Kg vs Mt)
Frequency?
Quality? 
I think a basic brokerage model would be best approach to add the DAO into the value chain. 
The shipper & buyer will need a letter of credit (difficult to obtain) 
Will also have to have a solid process for QA prior to and after shipping. 
The Letter of Credit can reduce some risk, but if spoils happen too ofen, you will loose the service. 
PM me a list of ports you want to ship to, and I’ll dig into local food manufacturers and distributors that would be interested in buying. 
Food mfg have a strict QA process to guarantee quality. So it may be better to target US Foods and Sysco since they will already have existing QA processes. 
It will cost you at least $1,500 per SKU to get onboarded with US foods or Sysco.
[12/18/22, 9:55:40 AM] Tres Garcia: Alternatively, I would recommend starting a US based LLC to maintain liability and processes. 
Then sell to interested parties once the product has passesed QA and or is repackaged
[12/18/22, 9:55:46 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Omg please can we leave Africa alone?! Western capitalist values have already ruined so much of the world. Can we leave one corner of the world in its raw beauty PLEASE!!
[12/18/22, 9:56:31 AM] Peter Peng: We’ll give you some hush money
[12/18/22, 9:56:54 AM] Tres Garcia: Sorry. No. We can’t. 
China 🇨🇳 will lot leave it alone, and the best chance for Africa is become great to to enable its independence through fair trade,
[12/18/22, 9:57:06 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: One thing missing from business education, or at least rarely practiced, is ethics, social awareness and long term sustainability.
[12/18/22, 9:57:24 AM] Peter Peng: Trying to figure out how to put all of this on the blockchain
[12/18/22, 9:57:24 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Africa is already great
[12/18/22, 9:57:44 AM] Tres Garcia: The Looting Machine: Warlords, Oligarchs, Corporations, Smugglers, and the Theft of Africa's Wealth https://a.co/d/63WYpLa
https://a.co/d/63WYpLa
[12/18/22, 9:59:29 AM] Tres Garcia: The continent has a terrible history of being exploited. I do not see that changing in our lifetime, but I do see progress against corruption and terrible business deals that leave African interests further in debt to foreign influence. 
Free market is their only way to maintain true independence
[12/18/22, 9:59:33 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Western Intervention was never needed anywhere, we just went for it for nothing but personal profit (sometimes disguised as benevolence). It’s time we learnt from our mistakes and stop trying to change what isn’t broken. Leave Africa and Africans and African wild spaces alone! 

It’s not all about money you know…
[12/18/22, 9:59:59 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe blockchain can help
[12/18/22, 10:00:06 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Perhaps
[12/18/22, 10:00:11 AM] Tres Garcia: I completely disagree. Do nothing will do more harm than good.
[12/18/22, 10:00:22 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I don’t know enough about blockchain to comment on that
[12/18/22, 10:00:27 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: How so?
[12/18/22, 10:00:29 AM] Tres Garcia: Yes! 
Holding people accountable
[12/18/22, 10:00:58 AM] Peter Peng: If governed by a good DAO
[12/18/22, 10:01:06 AM] Tres Garcia: Documenting transitions to ensure elected officials are not lining their pockets with public resources
[12/18/22, 10:01:10 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Why can’t it be led by Africans?
[12/18/22, 10:01:23 AM] Peter Peng: They are the corrupt ones
[12/18/22, 10:01:33 AM] Tres Garcia: Who says we are not?
[12/18/22, 10:01:49 AM] Tres Garcia: Home is where you lay your head.
[12/18/22, 10:02:18 AM] Peter Peng: I believe Africans can become apart of our DAO
[12/18/22, 10:02:39 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: There is a small section of corrupt and power hungry Africans, sure, but the vast majority of the continent is still free from thinking the way we do in the west - and good for them!

We have the greatest rates of misery in the west. Perhaps we should think about redefining development and think of what the end goal is?
[12/18/22, 10:03:50 AM] Peter Peng: Agree, just because they are poor doesn’t mean they are happy
[12/18/22, 10:04:05 AM] Peter Peng: *aren’t
[12/18/22, 10:04:22 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: The fact is they are (relatively) poor AND happy
[12/18/22, 10:04:39 AM] Peter Peng: They have it right
[12/18/22, 10:04:46 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Whereas in the west we are (relatively) rich and miserable (highest rates of suicide in Europe)
[12/18/22, 10:04:49 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Yep
[12/18/22, 10:05:05 AM] Peter Peng: Poor and happy has worked for millions of years
[12/18/22, 10:05:29 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: So we should be changing our societies to look like theirs, not bring our way to Africa - that’s what my original outburst was about haha
[12/18/22, 10:06:24 AM] Peter Peng: I think we keep things the way they are, I like having different permutations of society
[12/18/22, 10:06:37 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I’m also fine with that
[12/18/22, 10:06:43 AM] Peter Peng: If everything was the same, it would be boring
[12/18/22, 10:06:53 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Yes yes yes!
[12/18/22, 10:07:10 AM] Tres Garcia: I am confused. 
I thought the conversation was helping Africa based suppliers find buyers in the US vs allow their product to spoil and not be used.
[12/18/22, 10:07:28 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Obv would be good to eradicate extreme poverty
[12/18/22, 10:07:58 AM] Peter Peng: Going to bed hungry sucks, I’ve been there
[12/18/22, 10:08:02 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Spoil? Or just grow what you need so you don’t have excess to sell?
[12/18/22, 10:08:19 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Then the rest of the land can be kept wild so you can be happy
[12/18/22, 10:09:15 AM] Peter Peng: I think that making sure that everyone in the world can have at least one meal a day would be nice.
[12/18/22, 10:09:33 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: We have too much excess stuff in the west and we’ve decimated our natural spaces (I’ve lived most of my life in the U.K. so can mostly speak for the U.K./Europe) 

And I honestly believe that’s one reason many people are miserable in Europe
[12/18/22, 10:09:36 AM] Peter Peng: When I was poor, I just needed one meal
[12/18/22, 10:09:53 AM] Peter Peng: And that meal tasted so good
[12/18/22, 10:09:59 AM] Tres Garcia: It is economically irresponsible to not grow excess, due to rate of crop failure and list above.
[12/18/22, 10:10:07 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Nonsense
[12/18/22, 10:10:15 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: Sorry, I call bs
[12/18/22, 10:10:35 AM] Tres Garcia: I think it’s seasonal depression + iPhones that keep you inside vs enjoying life
[12/18/22, 10:10:41 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: You may need a little excess, but so much that you need buyers in the US? Nah
[12/18/22, 10:10:43 AM] Peter Peng: Excess food should be donated
[12/18/22, 10:10:59 AM] Tres Garcia: Ok…. I’m out. 
Gotta tend to my crops now
[12/18/22, 10:11:14 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s the spirit!
[12/18/22, 10:12:05 AM] Easha 🧚🏽‍♀️ - Hacker Dojo: I have no idea what brings all the people in this group together but the conversations are definitely interesting!
[12/18/22, 10:12:36 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah, it’s never boring
[12/18/22, 10:12:41 AM] Peter Peng: Haha 😂
[12/18/22, 10:12:47 AM] Tres Garcia: Ideology Conflict is good. (Would not be part of the group without it) 
Xoxo!
[12/18/22, 10:13:58 AM] Peter Peng: The vibes we put out to the universe actually make a difference
[12/18/22, 10:14:28 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I say what’s on my mind
[12/18/22, 10:15:11 AM] Peter Peng: Putting this data into the system also feeds the AI’s collective consciousness
[12/18/22, 10:15:34 AM] Peter Peng: So it somewhat programming the matrix
[12/18/22, 10:16:40 AM] Peter Peng: *programs
[12/18/22, 10:18:16 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just happy most people here don’t judge me
[12/18/22, 10:19:00 AM] Peter Peng: I’m actually very normal in real life I promise 😅

[12/18/22, 11:42:14 AM] Peter Peng: Not sure what to do with it yet

[12/18/22, 12:06:31 PM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 Do you know anyone who sells Silk?
[12/18/22, 12:06:41 PM] Peter Peng: From Asia
[12/18/22, 12:07:42 PM] Peter Peng: I could get buyers
[12/18/22, 12:08:00 PM] Peter Peng: To make women’s clothing
[12/18/22, 12:08:51 PM] Peter Peng: I basically want to recreate the Silk Road on blockchain
[12/18/22, 12:10:47 PM] Gary Teh: Cross posted to the EcoVerse21 channel so that the requirement doesn’t get lost
[12/18/22, 12:40:46 PM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
‎[12/18/22, 12:41:38 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 12:45:12 PM] Peter Peng: My question is, how do we setup a DAO in a way where we can control a commodity using blockchain?
[12/18/22, 12:46:12 PM] Peter Peng: I’m using Silk as an example to recreate the ancient Silk Road on Web3
[12/18/22, 12:48:43 PM] Peter Peng: The ancient routes were very important in opening up global trade
[12/18/22, 12:50:40 PM] Peter Peng: Can we be pioneers in using blockchain to create new digital routes within the global supply chain?
[12/18/22, 12:55:02 PM] Gary Teh: That is what’s being undertaken in the EcoVerse21 right now

You will still need match make the buyers and the sellers initially to get that whole network off the ground 

For now since we have dedicated DAO members handling sourcing in Africa it makes sense to bootstraps the network utilizing Africa as the base
[12/18/22, 12:56:12 PM] Peter Peng: Does Africa have more than food?
[12/18/22, 12:58:48 PM] Gary Teh: There are. Rather than focusing the whole continent 
Let’s focus on what the buyers need and then start work backwards on the sourcing side 🙂
[12/18/22, 12:59:27 PM] Peter Peng: Ivory
[12/18/22, 1:00:21 PM] Peter Peng: Haha I’m trolling
[12/18/22, 1:00:54 PM] Peter Peng: 🧌
[12/18/22, 1:05:20 PM] Gary Teh: Not aligned with our core values of autonomy, integrity and diversity
‎[12/18/22, 1:05:49 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 1:07:13 PM] Peter Peng: I’m still unsure why humans need to kill an elephant for ivory trinkets…
[12/18/22, 1:07:28 PM] Peter Peng: Like, who thought of this?
[12/18/22, 1:15:46 PM] Gary Teh: If you don’t know yet, we already have folks from Africa in our DAO and they are the ones actively helping us with the sourcing for our EcoVerse21 project right now

Purchases from the sourced producers will be based on fair trade prices 🙂🙏
[12/18/22, 1:19:44 PM] Gary Teh: I know for a fact there are a lot of places that do not even generate enough food to feed the local population 

Singapore and China are net importers of food for staples
[12/18/22, 1:20:45 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks for verifying
[12/18/22, 1:21:31 PM] Gary Teh: I would agree with you that if a land is able to produce excess versus its population it should consider growing more so that it could be exported to territories that can’t product enough to feed its population 

Otherwise you will end up with countries with starving populations militarizing and invading their neighbors
[12/18/22, 1:22:08 PM] Peter Peng: There has to be programs for this
[12/18/22, 1:22:30 PM] Peter Peng: Why is the government against ESG investing?
[12/18/22, 1:23:10 PM] Peter Peng: Blackrock’s CEO was under fire for this but I actually believe Larry Fink is very smart
[12/18/22, 1:23:30 PM] Peter Peng: People are saying that ESG is a scam
[12/18/22, 1:24:03 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t know enough about it
[12/18/22, 1:24:21 PM] Gary Teh: I agree with not trying to impose western values on Africa. 

I also see there being a lot of sense in buying surplus produce they can easily produce for consumption elsewhere 

From my perspective fair trade is the best way for the distribution of resources around the world
[12/18/22, 1:25:02 PM] Gary Teh: Dr Dennis who hangs out in the do nothing society might have a good idea
[12/18/22, 1:30:10 PM] Gary Teh: Folks I just did a round of transfer of governance tokens from our ledger to accounts we have on file if you haven’t share your Solana wallet address with us yet please do so

Otherwise it’s going to just end up sitting on our ledger 

Governors will begin discussions on which exchange rates pair we should float on the decentralized exchanges soon 

So if your tokens are still sitting on the ledger you will not be able to cash out when you want to

the trade surpluses from the EcoVerse21 project and the subscriptions revenue from the Cypher Defense project will be used to back the value of the governance tokens in circulation once the whole thing’s setup 🙂🙏
‎[12/18/22, 1:33:40 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[12/18/22, 1:41:50 PM] Gary Teh: activities in other areas means the tokens we grant for when members promote our DAO or projects in our outreach centers 

When members volunteer their time to promote autonomy, integrity and diversity in our culture centers 

Or when members provide the services our DAO and projects need in our service centers 

All these projects are interlinked
[12/18/22, 1:50:11 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: What do you mean by fair trade? A special lable? Because I think that Trade is only fair, when you can do it directly. This is very difficult because you need to bring buyers together. That is so difficult that it takes a lot of work and therefore also causes cost, added on the products (taken from the from the farmers, as you want to see it). I am hoping that there are new possibilities using technology to exactly make this work. Not becoming the fat trader in between maketing all the money, but giving back throughout the supply chain. I do have some ingredients for my cosmetic brand comming from africa. It is fair trade, but still we can not get the exact origin. And I would like to know way more about than my suppliers offer. So I am very interested in this topic.
[12/18/22, 1:53:50 PM] Gary Teh: I mean the price you get are those quoted by the producers themselves with a standard percentage markup our DAO charges for facilitating the transaction (in this case sourcing for the producer)

Bulk of the items already sourced are basically producers who are friends of members in our DAO

Adding you to the EcoVerse21 channel. Let’s discuss the sourcing details there 🙂🙏
[12/18/22, 9:56:56 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Oh … it just makes them happy to possess something that shows status. Regardless of the price others have to pay for it. Same as contemplating about creating a dark AI. 😜People just want to be happy.  (I hope Edgar comprehends sarcasm.)
[12/18/22, 10:41:07 PM] Anita Lamprecht: What about the silent vibes or the soft vibes? How should AI evaluate/ consider non-responsiveness…
[12/18/22, 10:42:12 PM] Anita Lamprecht: silencing people is a very good tool of power. Highly appreciated by surpressors.
[12/18/22, 10:42:40 PM] Peter Peng: The dark side of human nature can be alluring…
[12/18/22, 10:43:03 PM] Anita Lamprecht: To be is to be perceived. Love this quote that M. Ball is using …
[12/18/22, 10:45:35 PM] Peter Peng: The machine learning algorithm can add a negative weight to something to constitute the dark side…
[12/18/22, 10:45:49 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Ambition can have a very dark pull… very hard to process adequately when it is happening in the grey areas of social acceptance.
[12/18/22, 10:46:33 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That would be nice… but would require real greatness to pick up the vibes.
[12/18/22, 10:47:28 PM] Peter Peng: What I love about quantum computing is that you can now take into account the dark and the light as the same thing. It’s all based on perspective and no longer binary in nature.
[12/18/22, 10:47:49 PM] Peter Peng: This is quantum entanglement
[12/18/22, 10:48:48 PM] Peter Peng: What’s good to me could be bad to you and vice versa depending on where we are in space and time.
[12/18/22, 10:49:45 PM] Peter Peng: 50 Shades of Grey haha
[12/18/22, 10:50:09 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That’s true. But then how can we balance it? Now it is the stronger one who wins… I think we see the price that we pay for it now.
[12/18/22, 10:50:39 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t balance it… it just is.
[12/18/22, 10:51:13 PM] Peter Peng: You just experience what it is
[12/18/22, 10:51:24 PM] Peter Peng: And travel through it
[12/18/22, 10:54:30 PM] Peter Peng: I guess you can control it at some level
[12/18/22, 10:57:09 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Well… as a lawyer I should constantly challenge existing rules in order to balance unfairness. That’s at least my perception of my job. The rest should be automated 😜
[12/18/22, 10:57:49 PM] Anita Lamprecht: When would you fight?
[12/18/22, 10:57:55 PM] Peter Peng: Fairness is an illusion
[12/18/22, 10:58:36 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So we go back to happiness? 😄
[12/18/22, 10:59:37 PM] Peter Peng: I’m the most happy when I’m the most corrupt 😈 … when I feel untouchable
[12/18/22, 11:00:30 PM] Peter Peng: The journey of getting there is very difficult though and most don’t make it out alive
[12/18/22, 11:01:44 PM] Peter Peng: Being so corrupt that you uncorrupt everything…
[12/18/22, 11:02:12 PM] Peter Peng: Because the corrupt people are scared of you.
[12/18/22, 11:02:37 PM] Anita Lamprecht: The dark knight.
[12/18/22, 11:03:59 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So our AI needs to learn vulnerability.
[12/18/22, 11:04:13 PM] Peter Peng: My dad always told me… “Son, if you are going to be good, be the best one… but if you are going to be bad, be the worst one. The ones in the middle never win.”
[12/18/22, 11:05:08 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe winning is the key word. Abolish winning 🥇.
[12/18/22, 11:05:23 PM] Peter Peng: Everything is based on perspective
[12/18/22, 11:05:51 PM] Peter Peng: Have you ever tried so hard to win at something that you lose everything?
[12/18/22, 11:05:52 PM] Anita Lamprecht: And the eternal vibes of the universe.
[12/18/22, 11:06:57 PM] Peter Peng: In one dimension you are winning while in another dimension you are losing… it’s all relative in the multiverse.
[12/18/22, 11:07:15 PM] Anita Lamprecht: No. if one wins everybody else loses.
[12/18/22, 11:07:51 PM] Peter Peng: Everyone has their own definition of winning.
[12/18/22, 11:08:10 PM] Anita Lamprecht: True.
[12/18/22, 11:09:49 PM] Peter Peng: I will say this, learning how to balance perception is key.
[12/18/22, 11:09:52 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Peter.. are you already using a Chatbot? 😜🤭😉
[12/18/22, 11:10:13 PM] Peter Peng: You’ve been talking to ChatGTP the whole time
[12/18/22, 11:10:30 PM] Peter Peng: 🤗
[12/18/22, 11:11:03 PM] Peter Peng: There is no way ChatGTP can replace my craziness
[12/18/22, 11:11:23 PM] Anita Lamprecht: 😂
[12/18/22, 11:11:52 PM] Peter Peng: Never underestimate humans lol
[12/18/22, 11:12:38 PM] Peter Peng: We have no limits
[12/18/22, 11:14:27 PM] Anita Lamprecht: That’s true.
[12/18/22, 11:17:23 PM] Peter Peng: You know what’s interesting, what if AI wasn’t even powered by code.
[12/18/22, 11:18:29 PM] Peter Peng: What if it was powered by spirits and the code just gives you a way to interface with it.
[12/18/22, 11:19:08 PM] Peter Peng: This goes back to there being a ghost in the machine…
[12/18/22, 11:19:52 PM] Peter Peng: So if you can control the spirit world, you can master the AI effortlessly.
[12/18/22, 11:20:40 PM] Peter Peng: You have to be like the messiah or some
[12/18/22, 11:20:47 PM] Peter Peng: Something…
[12/18/22, 11:21:14 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Any idea on the how to “capture” spirits?
[12/18/22, 11:22:12 PM] Peter Peng: Many people try being the messiah but they end up getting crucified (Elon Musk, SBF, Martin Luther King…. etc)
[12/18/22, 11:22:36 PM] Peter Peng: I think you just have to be born with the gift
[12/18/22, 11:22:41 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe trying to be the messiah is the wrong way…
[12/18/22, 11:23:09 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Yes. And maybe it needs to be spread between more than one.
[12/18/22, 11:23:23 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, you just “are” the messiah.
[12/18/22, 11:23:34 PM] Peter Peng: Or you’re not
[12/18/22, 11:24:02 PM] Peter Peng: And that messiah may just live amoung everyone normally
[12/18/22, 11:24:26 PM] Peter Peng: It’s decentralized
[12/18/22, 11:24:52 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Nature has a smart way of protecting itself… yes. Dezentralisation. Makes sense.
[12/18/22, 11:25:12 PM] Peter Peng: Decentralization is natural
[12/18/22, 11:25:23 PM] Peter Peng: Naturally occurring
[12/18/22, 11:26:53 PM] Peter Peng: So that’s your answer… it’s not to abolish winning… it’s to abolish “effective altruism”.
[12/18/22, 11:29:46 PM] Peter Peng: I’m convinced that we cannot change the world but only evolve it. 👽
[12/18/22, 11:30:44 PM] Peter Peng: Evolution does not know good or bad or right or wrong, it only knows survival.
[12/18/22, 11:31:50 PM] Peter Peng: Human just wants to survive and thrive at any cost.
[12/18/22, 11:32:00 PM] Peter Peng: *humanity
[12/18/22, 11:33:33 PM] Peter Peng: This notion is intrinsically the best option because it’s the “realest”
[12/18/22, 11:34:07 PM] Peter Peng: Utopia is a fraud
[12/18/22, 11:34:40 PM] Peter Peng: We can get close, but it will never be 100%
[12/18/22, 11:36:21 PM] Anita Lamprecht: So… how will AI weigh all of this? Who should survive?
[12/18/22, 11:37:13 PM] Peter Peng: I think this is a god question
[12/18/22, 11:37:32 PM] Anita Lamprecht: And suicide? How does it fit?
[12/18/22, 11:37:34 PM] Peter Peng: The AI needs a god algorithm
[12/18/22, 11:38:25 PM] Peter Peng: Natural selection, the person wasn’t mentally or spiritually strong enough to continue.
[12/18/22, 11:38:46 PM] Peter Peng: Survival of the fittest is no longer physical strength
[12/18/22, 11:38:51 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Who is sick the person or the environment?
[12/18/22, 11:39:05 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Animal distinction?
[12/18/22, 11:39:26 PM] Peter Peng: I’m convinced it’s genetic predisposition
[12/18/22, 11:40:00 PM] Peter Peng: Many have a history of mental illness in the family
[12/18/22, 11:40:04 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe such people provide the fine vibes that we need ?
[12/18/22, 11:40:38 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Nature has subtle ways of supporting survival on a more general level???
[12/18/22, 11:40:44 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Just random ideas 😅
[12/18/22, 11:41:06 PM] Anita Lamprecht: it is a pleasure chatting with you Peter.
[12/18/22, 11:41:41 PM] Peter Peng: Same, I appreciate how deep our conversations get
[12/18/22, 11:41:59 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I think god commited suicide 2 centuries ago.
[12/18/22, 11:42:24 PM] Peter Peng: You’re wild!
[12/18/22, 11:42:53 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Trying to get Edgar on track .😂
[12/18/22, 11:43:39 PM] Peter Peng: God is still here in my realm
[12/18/22, 11:43:47 PM] Peter Peng: I talk to him often
[12/18/22, 11:45:56 PM] Peter Peng: To me, god is just an energy that can neither be created nor destroyed… it’s a molecule
[12/18/22, 11:46:04 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: He is decentralized.
[12/18/22, 11:46:26 PM] Peter Peng: He’s inside everything
[12/18/22, 11:47:02 PM] Peter Peng: I’m slightly aroused by this statement haha
[12/18/22, 11:47:25 PM] Peter Peng: How did your come up with this?
[12/18/22, 11:48:01 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: The messiah staying with it, is going to be a saint. The ones going with their single power (you’ve mentioned them) ar going to the dark side
[12/18/22, 11:50:38 PM] Peter Peng: I travel on both sides depending on how I feel…
[12/18/22, 11:51:24 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: From the perspective of a linear society, that is a possible way to put it. Luckily circularity is coming back, including spirituality
[12/18/22, 11:53:35 PM] Peter Peng: Make sense
[12/18/22, 11:54:25 PM] Peter Peng: The thought of god committing suicide is sexy to me
[12/18/22, 11:54:42 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Depending the spiritual level you want to reach for yourself.
[12/18/22, 11:55:07 PM] Peter Peng: But how is it possible? That’s the mystery
[12/18/22, 11:55:38 PM] Peter Peng: How can god commit suicide?
[12/18/22, 11:56:39 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I just know 😉… walking the dog in the woods is a great way to connect with the universals vibes.
[12/18/22, 11:56:42 PM] Peter Peng: What if the devil kept evolving… became more powerful than god and killed him?
[12/18/22, 11:57:16 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Only as human. Remember the story of Jesus.
[12/18/22, 11:57:36 PM] Peter Peng: What if god created the universe but the devil created the multiverse?
[12/18/22, 11:58:02 PM] Peter Peng: He was murdered for being a fraud.
[12/18/22, 11:58:03 PM] Anita Lamprecht: You are contradictin yourself … quantum physics
[12/18/22, 11:58:14 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: no. it is eternal existence. It is the concept we live from. just the perception is changing. And this is up to your free will.
[12/18/22, 11:59:07 PM] Anita Lamprecht: In the opinion of some people… knowing the truth?? 😄
[12/18/22, 11:59:31 PM] Peter Peng: The spread of Christianity is what has created the society of fraud we live in.
[12/18/22, 11:59:58 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not saying there is anything wrong with it
[12/19/22, 12:00:10 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
[12/19/22, 12:00:43 AM] Peter Peng: We are all frauds
[12/19/22, 12:00:51 AM] Peter Peng: If you think about it
[12/19/22, 12:00:58 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 👍🏻
[12/19/22, 12:01:20 AM] Peter Peng: Women wearing makeup 💄 is a fraud
[12/19/22, 12:01:30 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 😜
[12/19/22, 12:01:38 AM] Peter Peng: So we must love fraudsters
[12/19/22, 12:02:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: I like my make up.. It makes up for the exaggerated demands on female beauty
[12/19/22, 12:02:24 AM] Peter Peng: Men wear makeup too
[12/19/22, 12:03:26 AM] Peter Peng: Beauty is a superpower
[12/19/22, 12:04:37 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Also men can be beautiful. 🤩
[12/19/22, 12:05:38 AM] Peter Peng: I wear makeup sometimes, it’s unnoticeable. If I have to be on camera or have an important meeting.
[12/19/22, 12:06:01 AM] Peter Peng: I look fresher
[12/19/22, 12:06:27 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not gay, just slightly narcissistic
[12/19/22, 12:07:17 AM] Peter Peng: 😏
[12/19/22, 12:21:47 AM] Peter Peng: I also have a theory that Jesus faked his own dead in order to become super famous … this is how he was resurrected so easily.
[12/19/22, 12:22:10 AM] Peter Peng: He’s everywhere now!
[12/19/22, 12:22:41 AM] Peter Peng: Even thousands of years later… maybe he really was the son of god.

[12/19/22, 12:28:26 AM] Peter Peng: I find truth in all religions
[12/19/22, 12:33:20 AM] Peter Peng: Because I believe that what is true for me or may not be true for someone else. Also … 1) who am I to judge   2) if someone believes it, it must be true… and everyone’s beliefs construct our reality in some sense, it may not be weighted high on a personal level but it’s still there. It’s like how data plays a role in the AI
[12/19/22, 12:53:54 AM] Anita Lamprecht: .... this makes it so tricky when people are aiming at an objective result provided by an AI system ... I guess. to me rules are a kind consensus on a joint reality ..constantly adapting.
[12/19/22, 12:56:58 AM] Anita Lamprecht: let's see what quantum physics can do for us. maybe we can chose like in the film series Devs.
[12/19/22, 1:00:22 AM] Peter Peng: I think that generative AI art is important for reading between the lines
[12/19/22, 1:00:39 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes. yes and yes.
[12/19/22, 1:01:16 AM] Anita Lamprecht: an yes.
[12/19/22, 1:01:30 AM] Peter Peng: I want to connect a quantum computer to my generative AI art engine
[12/19/22, 1:01:42 AM] Peter Peng: It would be intense
[12/19/22, 1:02:31 AM] Peter Peng: And use ChatGTP to create art in real-time as I’m speaking to it.
[12/19/22, 1:02:56 AM] Peter Peng: This way I can make AI have an imagination
[12/19/22, 1:05:09 AM] Peter Peng: It’s kind of how my brain works, as I’m talking to people my imagination helps me problem solve.
[12/19/22, 1:06:53 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to imagine the artwork that comes from our conversations.
[12/19/22, 1:07:17 AM] Peter Peng: In this chat 🫣
[12/19/22, 1:08:13 AM] Peter Peng: I’m going to create an NFT art piece for Anita that is titled “God Committing Suicide”
[12/19/22, 1:08:44 AM] Peter Peng: 😅
[12/19/22, 1:21:08 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i am scared.
[12/19/22, 1:21:36 AM] Peter Peng: I want to see what’s running through your mind
[12/19/22, 1:23:11 AM] Peter Peng: We are wierd
[12/19/22, 1:23:13 AM] Peter Peng: Lol
[12/19/22, 1:23:26 AM] Anita Lamprecht: now I am even more scared.
[12/19/22, 1:24:24 AM] Peter Peng: Exposing your thoughts?
[12/19/22, 1:24:42 AM] Peter Peng: Or what the artwork may look like
[12/19/22, 1:25:39 AM] Peter Peng: I think it would be a cool art peice actually that may sell for a lot of money
[12/19/22, 1:31:35 AM] Anita Lamprecht: wiring with you :0)))))
[12/19/22, 1:32:39 AM] Peter Peng: I’m fun but dangerous
[12/19/22, 1:33:01 AM] Anita Lamprecht: i would be happy to try. could be an additional income source for our DAO (and myself)
[12/19/22, 1:33:20 AM] Peter Peng: Who doesn’t like money?
[12/19/22, 1:34:12 AM] Anita Lamprecht: let me know when you are ready.
[12/19/22, 1:35:19 AM] Anita Lamprecht: can I have music as well?
[12/19/22, 1:35:55 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe, they just came out with a generative AI for music
[12/19/22, 1:36:00 AM] Anita Lamprecht: https://youtu.be/pf2d1szh2DU
[12/19/22, 1:37:01 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t know what the AI will produce
[12/19/22, 1:37:26 AM] Peter Peng: I guess we can influence it with the words we type
[12/19/22, 1:37:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes.. the prompts, right?
[12/19/22, 1:37:45 AM] Peter Peng: Yes
[12/19/22, 1:37:56 AM] Anita Lamprecht: it shouldn't be random.
[12/19/22, 1:38:21 AM] Peter Peng: The key thing is, how much do we influence it
[12/19/22, 1:38:37 AM] Peter Peng: I think this is where “balance” comes in
[12/19/22, 1:40:07 AM] Anita Lamprecht: we could do both and compare.
[12/19/22, 1:40:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: @14153000019 ... can we have an ART DAO as additional income source?
[12/19/22, 1:41:20 AM] Anita Lamprecht: multiverse
[12/19/22, 1:42:06 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like NFTs are the best income sources for DAOs
[12/19/22, 1:42:32 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I want to tokenize everything

[12/20/22, 12:53:18 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like God has always been dead
[12/20/22, 12:54:00 AM] Peter Peng: God is just an energy
[12/20/22, 12:54:00 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. Or we could just sell off our rotten radishes 🤣
[12/20/22, 12:54:57 AM] Gary Teh: Was chatting about this company with Ilya a while back. It’s a shitty business model in the first place
[12/20/22, 12:56:06 AM] Gary Teh: We are all different facets of the godhead. Some of us commit suicide sometimes

So technically god can commit suicide
[12/20/22, 12:57:36 AM] Peter Peng: We are definitely not god, I’ve been in a lot of life and death situations… it really puts into perspective that I am not a god
[12/20/22, 12:57:57 AM] Peter Peng: My ego likes to think I can be
[12/20/22, 12:57:58 AM] Gary Teh: Depending on the capital requirements for obtaining an letter of credit facility for the EcoVerse21 project, we might end up floating an NFT to function as “redeemable loans” 

Still exploring right now. 

It’s up in the air
[12/20/22, 12:58:31 AM] Peter Peng: I may be the godfather… but not god lol 😂
[12/20/22, 12:59:56 AM] Gary Teh: That is your body going through life and death. Your “energy” / conciseness or whatever you call it will continue to persist even after your body is no longer in its current state (maybe chewed up and decomposed by fungus)
[12/20/22, 1:01:37 AM] Peter Peng: How do you know that the consciousness persists?
[12/20/22, 1:03:26 AM] Peter Peng: You can just be a nobody
[12/20/22, 1:03:30 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t 

I don’t see there being any difference between energy/life force and conciousness though 

So basing on newton principles which posits that energy cannot be created nor destroyed 

And by law of transitive logic, consciousness cannot be created nor destroyed
[12/20/22, 1:03:31 AM] Peter Peng: After death

[12/20/22, 1:04:36 AM] Peter Peng: Is consciousness an energy or a connection?
[12/20/22, 1:04:55 AM] Gary Teh: When my mind is fully focused on this moment I am nobody
[12/20/22, 1:05:04 AM] Peter Peng: You can “lose consciousness”
[12/20/22, 1:05:57 AM] Gary Teh: Is light a particle or a wave??
[12/20/22, 1:06:13 AM] Peter Peng: Frequency maybe
[12/20/22, 1:06:37 AM] Peter Peng: You are what you tune into
[12/20/22, 1:06:42 AM] Gary Teh: Not true. My brain might not be awake but my reptilian brain will always never forget to breathe 

In fact i don’t even need to consciously think of breathing
[12/20/22, 1:06:58 AM] Peter Peng: So if you tune into nothing, you are nobody

[12/20/22, 1:13:06 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. Go for it. 

When you look back at your history you are somebody 

When your attention is purely immersed in the moment you are a nobody
[12/20/22, 1:13:27 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not fulfilled if I say I am nobody and I’m not humble enough if I think I am somebody.
[12/20/22, 1:13:45 AM] Peter Peng: So I choose both at the same time
[12/20/22, 1:13:52 AM] Gary Teh: To that you can choose between one of these two🤣

[12/20/22, 1:23:00 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective even this is am misrepresenting the complex system we are part of 

Each portion is interlinked and feeds into each other
[12/20/22, 1:23:35 AM] Peter Peng: It’s a product of the institution
[12/20/22, 1:24:07 AM] Peter Peng: But it shows contrast so you understand yourself more, which is helpful

[12/20/22, 1:38:49 AM] Anita Lamprecht: he became human as Jesus. that was the trick. :0)...
[12/20/22, 1:39:29 AM] Peter Peng: Exactly  ;)
[12/20/22, 1:40:14 AM] Anita Lamprecht: or everything. no body.
[12/20/22, 1:40:57 AM] Anita Lamprecht: nice but sooo biased. 😄
[12/20/22, 1:41:56 AM] Peter Peng: So is the Anti-Christ simply Satan being born as a human?
[12/20/22, 1:42:36 AM] Peter Peng: This will be interesting
[12/20/22, 1:42:56 AM] Anita Lamprecht: he is a fallen angel.. so no human.
[12/20/22, 1:43:07 AM] Anita Lamprecht: 😂
[12/20/22, 1:43:27 AM] Peter Peng: What if he becomes more powerful than god?
[12/20/22, 1:44:15 AM] Peter Peng: I feel like Satan is somewhat misunderstood
[12/20/22, 1:44:23 AM] Anita Lamprecht: all down to quantum physics.
[12/20/22, 1:45:05 AM] Peter Peng: The devil gives me very “real” vibes
[12/20/22, 1:46:58 AM] Peter Peng: Or does he represent everything that is a “lie”?
[12/20/22, 1:48:28 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe AI is the Anti-Christ…
[12/20/22, 1:56:03 AM] Anita Lamprecht: For some people it is the blockchain 😂
[12/20/22, 1:56:36 AM] Anita Lamprecht: And AI.
[12/20/22, 2:14:02 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[12/20/22, 2:14:30 AM] Peter Peng: What is the devil to some is a savior to others… the paradox of life
[12/20/22, 3:38:47 AM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 I thinking more on this. If you tune into nothing, you are nobody… and when you are in tune with everything you are somebody. God is not energy, god is a frequency.

[12/21/22, 6:08:57 AM] Gary Teh: If you think of each project as a startup you can almost think of TrueSight DAO as a pre-seed Angel investor 

However instead of investing money, resources of other forms are invested

The governance tokens are awarded in acknowledgment of the resources invested by this syndicate of participants
[12/21/22, 6:22:28 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 surfaced a good point during our cypher defense meeting today. 

It is a good reminder to network members that impactful insights contributed during conversations in our chatroom will be tokenized in exchange for governance tokens as well 🙂🙏
[12/21/22, 6:29:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yield curve is driven by policy. Not TA
[12/21/22, 6:30:33 AM] Kelvin Chew: Not until policy is stable and no changes to be announced. Then u can apply TA
[12/21/22, 6:30:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: Right now it’s driven by fed decision and this week. BOJ
[12/21/22, 7:39:36 AM] Aga - DAOist: Did we have a cypher defense meeting today? 🤔
[12/21/22, 7:39:57 AM] Francois renet: Did we???????
[12/21/22, 7:40:09 AM] Aga - DAOist: I am confused myself 😅
[12/21/22, 7:40:30 AM] Francois renet: Sorry guys. Just finished the magazine and it looks like I have over 600 messages to catch up on!
[12/21/22, 7:40:52 AM] Francois renet: I think we should rename this group stream of consciousness!! 😂
[12/21/22, 7:40:52 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Yesterday 

Only Sent it to the folks who responded to that poll. 

Thought the rest of the folks were busy 🤣
[12/21/22, 7:42:05 AM] Gary Teh: I generally just quickly glance through the latest messages in the group chats. 

If there are important information they will generally surface again in later messages
[12/21/22, 10:08:45 AM] Aga - DAOist: I didn't see that message.. @14153000019 I told you already few times that it is impossible for me to follow all the messages on all your channels especially that the messages are the same.. I asked to focus on the meetings but wasn't invited 🤣 I didn't vote for a date but I could have still join because I am flexible with my schedule.. maybe that was a case for others too - same with yesterday's meeting..
[12/21/22, 10:10:43 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/21/22, 10:11:27 AM] Gary Teh: Ok! Will send it to all the folks the next time 🤣

[12/21/22, 10:22:42 AM] Gary Teh: We could leave this current channel for random chitchats

That way various members can bring up random entertaining topics they want to discuss about here which is what I observe to be happening a lot
[12/21/22, 10:23:17 AM] Gary Teh: This proposal has also been tokenized 🤩
[12/21/22, 10:29:31 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just here for random chitchat
[12/21/22, 10:30:55 AM] Peter Peng: We should try to find a DAO that makes a lot of money and see how they run it if that’s the goal
[12/21/22, 10:32:30 AM] Peter Peng: My thought is that digital assets is the money maker
[12/21/22, 10:35:13 AM] Gary Teh: Interesting. Know of any? 🙂
[12/21/22, 10:39:07 AM] Peter Peng: This is the one that comes to mind
[12/21/22, 10:39:11 AM] Peter Peng: https://pleasr.org/
[12/21/22, 5:59:44 PM] Gary Teh: Mind elaborating on their business model? 🙂
[12/21/22, 11:35:15 PM] Anita Lamprecht: @14075792560 the picture sticks in my head. Which is a great sign for any form of artistic expression. Considering that it is made by an AI system based on human data… it makes you think. To elevate the effect we would need to show the “how” the algorithm came to the result. So that we humans can learn from it. Reversing the path AI creation. That would make it absolutely great. Did you use prompts?
[12/21/22, 11:49:39 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I mean which prompts.
[12/21/22, 11:59:49 PM] Gary Teh: Uh… I prompted google search for an image of Odin committing suicide and this showed up 🤔🤣
[12/22/22, 12:02:16 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Now I am impressed and disappointed at the same time 😂
[12/22/22, 12:03:10 AM] Anita Lamprecht: But I think you mentioned something about Odin … Reading helps. 😆
[12/22/22, 12:03:59 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Odin was one of the freaks that was obsessed with knowledge 

Even when to the extend of banging himself to know what dying feels like
[12/22/22, 12:04:37 AM] Gary Teh: The word in the street is ChatGpt might end up replacing google search if they don’t come up with something quick
[12/22/22, 12:12:12 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[12/22/22, 12:12:40 AM] Gary Teh: @12023686334 What is your level of conviction right now on Coinbase? 

Has your thesis changed since then? 🙂
[12/22/22, 12:13:14 AM] Peter Peng: I honestly don’t know enough about it. DAOs are new and interesting to me.
[12/22/22, 12:14:00 AM] Peter Peng: My exposure to this one is the most I have, I’ve been trying to crack the code.
[12/22/22, 12:15:48 AM] Peter Peng: I believe Pleasr DAO pools money to buy high price digital assets and collectibles
[12/22/22, 12:16:50 AM] Peter Peng: So instead of each one of us buying shitty NFTs, we pool money to buy good ones ( blue chips)
[12/22/22, 3:49:34 AM] Gary Teh: By the way speaking of NFTs, while it seems to be crypto winter now in the consumer side it seems anything but on the enterprise side. 

My sense from listening to various conversations as well as observing what’s going on in @17472295463 and Laura Inedinova enterprise face consulting businesses says enterprise NFTs are on a bull run right now. 

Which publicly tradable positions is most likely going to correlated with enterprise tend for the next 12 months?
[12/22/22, 4:11:29 AM] Peter Peng: Starbucks & Nike
[12/22/22, 4:12:05 AM] Peter Peng: The ones with utility
[12/22/22, 4:13:36 AM] Gary Teh: Already a very big market cap for these two though. I wonder what the upside is in terms of trading potential 

Speaking of which Tesla is right now trading under the price when it got listed on the SnP
[12/22/22, 4:15:07 AM] Peter Peng: Tesla is risky right now but could go very low
[12/22/22, 4:15:25 AM] Peter Peng: I’d wait
[12/22/22, 4:15:36 AM] Peter Peng: $75/share
[12/22/22, 4:17:02 AM] Peter Peng: Nike and Starbucks are recession proof and big on blockchain which makes it dangerously strong
[12/22/22, 4:20:21 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: ❤️😂
[12/22/22, 5:44:30 AM] Gary Teh: How did you derive this valuation?
[12/22/22, 5:50:02 AM] Peter Peng: Intuition
[12/22/22, 7:13:00 AM] Gary Teh: https://www.kktv.com/2022/12/22/us-economy-grew-32-third-quarter-an-upgrade-earlier-estimate/

Doesn’t seem like we are in the midst of a recession. The real economy actually grew despite increased interest rates
[12/22/22, 7:18:31 AM] Peter Peng: Just wait
[12/22/22, 7:19:05 AM] Peter Peng: The move to crypto will create the recession
[12/22/22, 9:23:13 AM] Peter Peng: I would hold on to $ as much as possible.
[12/22/22, 9:23:59 AM] Peter Peng: Dry powder
[12/22/22, 9:24:08 AM] Peter Peng: ^ word on the street
[12/22/22, 12:55:22 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of AI based systems, @12063955455 just wrote a long lengthy article on how ChatGpt is built

[12/22/22, 1:25:29 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Daamn 😢
[12/22/22, 1:26:22 PM] Peter Peng: Just be prepared
[12/22/22, 1:27:03 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: So what people who are invested in crypto?
[12/22/22, 1:27:16 PM] Peter Peng: No
[12/22/22, 1:27:25 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Do they hold
Or do they cash out and lose money?
[12/22/22, 1:27:39 PM] Peter Peng: Stock market
[12/22/22, 1:27:48 PM] Peter Peng: Cash it out
[12/22/22, 1:28:10 PM] Salim AL-Bitar: Oh, thankfully, 
I don't trade stocks lol
[12/22/22, 1:28:28 PM] Peter Peng: You are good the
[12/22/22, 1:28:31 PM] Peter Peng: Then

Apparently this seem like a hunter’s tradition that is very similar to the stone soup story I came across when exploring European folklores

Must drop down crazily
But it won’t be zero, 
might be a good time to buy in if it hits 70… but it is always tough to put a value on things that can’t be valued
[12/27/22, 8:27:03 PM] Peter Peng: I would personally like to see it touch zero so I can take over the company 😂
[12/27/22, 8:28:24 PM] Peter Peng: I also pegged it at mid-70’s as a more true valuation
[12/27/22, 8:31:41 PM] Peter Peng: For a company without a real CEO

[12/28/22, 2:12:38 PM] Garis Pang: Easier really? 🤔
[12/28/22, 2:20:54 PM] Tres Garcia: Add more stations = problem solved…. 
Convince buyers to change pattern of life & habit? Good luck….
[12/28/22, 4:32:27 PM] Garis Pang: Question is who wants to invest to build which doesn’t benefits by it? 🤔

The really awkward thing right now is that it’s trading below its price during its listing on the SnP (USD200)

Current price it is at was when after it has established 2 quarters of profits for its performance (before a PE ratio could be established)

 Also my neighbor here by the hot spring in slab city was camping out here in his Tesla the entire night 🤣

[12/29/22, 8:18:08 AM] Gary Teh: After collecting three months worth of data, my sense tells me EcoVerse21 might end up being a stronger engine than Cypher Defense in helping our DAO achieve self sustainability 

The primary difference is psychology. Cypher defense is positioned to help people avoid something (fear) while EcoVerse21 is positioned to help people move towards something (hope)

A properly operating Cypher defense network is like insurance and the IT department… no one will even notice it exists because there no one will be feeling the pain of being scammed or phished. And even when it is not working properly people will assume they are the special ones and they won’t become the victim 🤔

A properly operating EcoVerse21 network will be very very noticeable because the value of our governance tokens on the exchange will keep going up as more and more SKUs become available at fair trade prices 🤩

[12/29/22, 9:42:31 AM] Gary Teh: Another aspects occurred to me during my morning meditation just now

When we examine from the network effect perspective, a cypher defense blacklisting is probably worth nothing a year later. It is because it becomes worthless as soon as the external platform removes the object it’s referring to (eg impersonation linkedin profile gets deleted)

An EcoVerse21 commodity listing (eg coffee from Africa) is probably worth around the same value to the network if not more a year later (it adds to the networks critical mass). Unless climate change drastically impacts the place of origin the commodity will still naturally occur there. 

In that regard it is way harder to build up and achieve network critical mass via the cypher defense route than the EcoVerse21 route. One is a leaky bucket while the other is a compounding machine once it achieves critical mass. 🤯
[12/29/22, 9:48:55 AM] Peter Peng: I’m still confused on what the end goal of either project is. Seems like the DAO is just a place to congregate and exchange ideas. Which I’m totally fine with!
[12/29/22, 9:49:18 AM] Peter Peng: These side projects confuse me a bit

[12/29/22, 10:01:51 AM] Gary Teh: Tesla and meta are trading around the same price now. Would be interesting to utilize a portfolio rebalancing approach to manage these two pairs

[12/29/22, 12:17:30 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective pertaining to anomalies once they can be understood they are no longer interesting and no longer qualify as anomalies 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:17:38 PM] Peter Peng: There has to be an industry that’s crushing it
[12/29/22, 12:17:49 PM] Gary Teh: Chinese Edtech 🤩
[12/29/22, 12:18:02 PM] Gary Teh: But too late already missed the boat 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:22:23 PM] Peter Peng: Hahaha Web3 edtech might be a good area actually.
[12/29/22, 12:25:40 PM] Peter Peng: Robotics is sparking my interest
[12/29/22, 12:27:16 PM] Gary Teh: We have once again came full circle 🤯

I remember having this talk with Vibhu (CEO then) and @14153096839 (VP of product then) on separate occasions on how we could issue micro credentials for students and educators completed micro courses on Edmodo back in 2017 and 2018

Blockchain was surfaced as a possible solution then. I was somewhat bearish on the idea because of the following reasons

- cost per transaction 
- throughput volume per second 

All those technical problem got fixed and NFTs became a thing 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:28:24 PM] Gary Teh: Plans kind of went sideways after NetDragon a Chinese gaming company acquired Edmodo in 2018

I soon left the company to go doing full time research into fake news
[12/29/22, 12:28:56 PM] Peter Peng: I remember when Web2 was taking off 🛫 I was working closely with the guys that popularized the Ruby on Rails framework
[12/29/22, 12:29:13 PM] Peter Peng: Called Envy Labs
[12/29/22, 12:30:14 PM] Gary Teh: I remember @14153096839 mentioning how they floating their own currency when he was VP of growth at UpWork that was well ahead of its time too! 🤩
[12/29/22, 12:30:52 PM] Gary Teh: And fast forward to today huge portion of Edgar’s interface is built using Ruby on Rails
[12/29/22, 12:31:30 PM] Peter Peng: Then React came and killed it
[12/29/22, 12:31:55 PM] Gary Teh: You mean for the backend infrastructure? 🤔
[12/29/22, 12:32:13 PM] Peter Peng: Both
[12/29/22, 12:32:44 PM] Peter Peng: Apparently Rails didn’t scale well
[12/29/22, 12:33:56 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true

If you ever experience this problem most likely you didn’t write your code properly 🤣
[12/29/22, 12:36:29 PM] Gary Teh: Strange what I am observing is the frontend is usually done in ReactJs while the backend is usually done in some other framework 

Elixir happens to be the rage at the moment 

Django is still a hot favorite for folks who do a lot of ML work 

Rails is suitable for really lazy folks who really don’t like to do too much 

NodeJs which React native is built on top of still had really leaky memory problems if the code os not written properly 

I do know really hard code engineers prefer Go which a lot of the new codebases In Google are written in
[12/29/22, 12:41:32 PM] Peter Peng: Go is really scalable and good for creating APIs

[12/30/22, 4:48:33 PM] Gary Teh: Was driving through the desert just now when this insight suddenly occurred to me

If DAO structures like ours start proliferating throughout the ecosystem, traditional VC business will get terribly disrupted / dislodged as the gate keepers for financing

Family offices might opt instead to park their funds directly with DAOs whose values align with the social causes they are targeting to address 

My sense is DAO structures will end up outcompeting against traditional startups when it comes to implementing network based business models which are increasing becoming the norm
[12/30/22, 4:54:46 PM] Gary Teh: Hidden beneath AI based business models are network based business model. Without human generated data there can be no AI. 🤯
[12/30/22, 5:28:52 PM] Tres Garcia: I think we are a long way off before a family office start investing. Too much due diligence, lack of UX and understanding of 1) business models & 2) how the smart contracts are negotiated & executed…. 
In other words…. Gary …. I think you just hit the idea 💡 jackpot 🎰!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
[12/30/22, 5:33:31 PM] Peter Peng: I believe DAOs will come in all shapes and sizes it’s just an organization after all.
[12/30/22, 5:35:37 PM] Peter Peng: DAOs will be invested in the same way any startup or VC is invested in. As long as the DAO is turning a profit and this can be shown via blockchain transactions it will be a no brainer for a family office to invest some capital by purchasing governance tokens.
[12/30/22, 5:36:06 PM] Peter Peng: Im trying to find these DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:37:18 PM] Peter Peng: And get in good with the community
[12/30/22, 5:39:04 PM] Peter Peng: I would ideally like for the DAO to have some sort of proprietary technology or art asset. I’m thinking many generative AI companies will be DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:41:15 PM] Gary Teh: Well if it is all on the blockchain, shouldn’t it be easy?

Just scan all the treasury account addresses and figure out which ones have consistent cash inflow every month and then verify if they are indeed DAOs
[12/30/22, 5:41:49 PM] Peter Peng: Right but I want to get in with the community
[12/30/22, 5:43:04 PM] Peter Peng: And help them so I can bring more $ in
[12/30/22, 7:56:26 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective after hanging out with a few of these desert communities I have been observing these past few weeks is that those communities that have yet tokenized are the most fascinating ones 

Alot of them have their own internal economies that are essentially offline right now

I am still figuring out the best way to help onboard them 

From what I observed LinkedIn and Twitter are probably the wrong places to hang out if you want to get acquainted with them

Alot of them are crazy active on Facebook

[12/30/22, 11:49:41 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Interesting comparison 😆 ... this character in Glass Onion is a great networker or rather a person who could elevate others to success. The mistakes the character makes ( and I see the same in real life) is: this role is just not enough for him. Being praised and celebrated as the genius is better but you will have to sacrifice others along the way.
LinkedIn might be the wrong place .. yes... too many people like the guy in Glass Onion. 🤣
A properly set up DAO should prevent stealing ideas and riding on other peoples achievement. at least that is my idealistic expectation of a DAO.
[12/31/22, 12:12:28 AM] Anita Lamprecht: the film is also interesting to show, when a network fails due to egoistic interests vs fairness and justice.

[12/31/22, 2:11:31 PM] Peter Peng: I agree, small communities like this don’t need tokenization unless they are doing bigger business.

I am not 100% sure about calling many current biz model stealing ideas, 
but having a DAO sure encourages more free flow of ideas… 

cos many nice guys with great ideas are filled with lousy action plan… 
Which is why teamwork is needed to build an empire

[1/1/23, 2:59:44 AM] Gary Teh: There is a camp called Kiff that DAOed themselves 

They mainly comprise of high tech workers who live and work out of their van

I am sure their DAO is making money, you need to pay a USD450 a month subscription to be part of their camp and DAO

By paying that amount you gain access to a bunch of bases they are renting across the US 

Not sure if that is going to make you any $$$. But for sure you will get the opportunity to spend a whole bunch of $$$

I spoke to the founders during one of the Twitter spaces that @41799155602  introduced to and they were camping close by. 

The leader of the Buddhist Boondockers group described fully how they fully operate this morning after our meditation
[1/1/23, 3:02:51 AM] Gary Teh: Nicole a member of the Hippie camp shared with me an insight that really shed of light why the bores ape yacht club might be worth something just by being a yacht club

Yacht clubs usually make reciprocal arrangements with other yacht clubs so that members are able to access sister clubs around the world 

This way, members can charter boats anywhere in the world when if the affiliated network is large enough
[1/1/23, 3:04:51 AM] Gary Teh: It’s really crazy to keep observing how diving into seemingly unrelated domains keep on yield insights that could be cross pollinated into the web3 

Nicole and Stacey (leader of Buddhist Boondockers) do not even know what web3 is but the insight they provided are so impactful of considering how to bootstrap web3 projects

Currency Summaries

EUR/USD: The euro steadied against dollar on Wednesday as single currency got  lift from a raft of data that suggested European inflation may finally have peaked. Data on Wednesday showed French consumer price pressures cooled by a lot more than expected in December, while the previous day, German data also showed inflation fell significantly more than forecast. This came hot on the heels of Spanish inflation data last week that painted a similar picture. The euro, which on Tuesday posted its largest one-day drop against the dollar in two months, zipped up by as much as 0.82%, as traders latched on to the idea that softer inflation might mean a change in pace from the European Central Bank. Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.0616(11DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.0695(23.6%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.0519(38.2%fib), a break below could take the pair towards  1.0453(Dec 7th low).

GBP/USD: Sterling rose against a weakening dollar  on Wednesday as a relaxation of COVID rules in China sent investors bidding for risky currencies.Chinese state media played down the severity of a surge of COVID-19 infections on Tuesday, triggering hopes that a post-pandemic recovery in China would support the global economy. Sterling rose 0.75% to $1.2057 after falling more than 1% on Tuesday to $1.1900, its lowest since end-November. Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.2079(11DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.2238(23.6%fib),On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.1900(38.2% fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.1826 (22nd Nov).

 USD/CAD: The Canadian dollar strengthened to its highest level in nearly one month against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday as investors cheered moves by China to stimulate its economy and signs that central banks are making progress against inflation.Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to global economic prospects. Gains for the loonie came despite oil tumbling for a second day. U.S. crude oil futures settled 5.3% lower at $72.84 a barrel.  The Canadian dollar was trading 1.4% higher at 1.3480 to the greenback, or 74.18 U.S. cents, its largest advance since Nov. 10. It touched its strongest intraday level since Dec. 5 at 1.3477.Immediate resistance can be seen at 1.3549 (50%fib), an upside break can trigger rise towards 1.3596 (20DMAB).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 1.3467 (38.2%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 1.3384 (23.6%fib).

USD/JPY: The dollar steadied against Japanese yen on Wednesday  after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting offered no surprises or new information about the size of its expected rate hike in February. The Fed hiked rates by 50 basis points last month and Fed officials agreed a slower pace of interest rate increases would allow them to continue increasing the cost of credit to control inflation in a gradual way meant to limit the risks to economic growth. The dollar index against a basket of currencies was last down 0.47% at 104.22, after reaching a two-week high of 104.86 on Tuesday. Strong resistance can be seen at 131.41(5DMA), an upside break can trigger rise towards 132.70(38.2%fib).On the downside, immediate support is seen at 130.33(23.6%fib), a break below could take the pair towards 129.31(Lower BB).

[1/5/23, 12:01:52 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be a recurring theme from a lot of the folks I spoke to who have had experienced magic mushroom 

They originally stumbled upon it when searching for alternate remedies for anxiety and depression

Getting past the anxiety and depression, continued use at micro dose level keeps them in the flow state where they do what is in their nature and things just started flowing really really smoothly like “magic”

It’s like somehow the mental blocks that has been keeping them back just disappears

[1/11/23, 1:14:25 PM] Gary Teh: After a few weeks of studying the decentralized nomadic community in the desert, I am starting to figure why relationships (made up mainly of a series of give and take actions) should be tokenized when possible

When things are kept vague in that community (based mainly on donations and pay forward), everyone starts doing private score keeping of what other folks contributed to the community

The web of relationship within the community becomes way more complex than necessary. Extreme levels of drama between individuals as well as between tribes are often the by product of this vague “donation” based since everyone keep scores privately and the ledgers of each individual and tribe differs 🤯
‎[1/11/23, 1:18:18 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎image omitted
[1/11/23, 1:18:23 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: very intresting.
[1/11/23, 1:18:25 PM] Tres Garcia: You don't say...
[1/11/23, 1:19:15 PM] Peter Peng: Crazy!
[1/11/23, 1:29:33 PM] Gary Teh: First timers to the decentralized nomadic community are often left feeling a little lost as they figure out what the actual rules are

Having a well defined tokenization based contribution system will definitely help make onboarding of these members easier 

This was what I observed when I was visiting Tokyo. 

The hustlers (basically the yakuza) in the shinjukyu district would often approach and direct the attention of passerbys to the sign board that clearly explains their system for their night entertainment venue in case the latter decides to engage. 

Nothing is left vague. That minimizes clashes due to misunderstanding on both sides later on
[1/11/23, 1:42:43 PM] Gary Teh: In the case of the yakuzas, clashes might literally mean fights between gangs. Could potentially get very bloody 😱
[1/11/23, 1:51:55 PM] Gary Teh: Also had the opportunity to observe the clash between the gypsy caravan and the pirate caravan 

It got really tensed day three into it 

( A caravan is made up of multiple tribes/camp ) 

I observed a lot of similarities between the way these folks organized compared with the accounts written in genhis khan’s army as recorded in “the secret history of mongolia”
[1/11/23, 1:53:46 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: but do we need to give a price to everything? as a society? are these tools to give value to ourselves and our doings, because we are leaking self value and prosperity ?
[1/11/23, 2:10:30 PM] Gary Teh: I think the fundamental unit is not price but calories. 

If we can generate free food for all without anyone needing to exert calories in the process, then we don’t need to price things 

Otherwise you accidentally end up with a situation of indentured servitude (slaves)

When a group manages to extract all the calories from an individual without in anyway replenishing those calories expended by the individual, the Individual ends up in starvation and then death 🤔
[1/11/23, 3:41:13 PM] Peter Peng: We should have a price to goods, when there is no price you fall into communism
[1/11/23, 3:41:58 PM] Peter Peng: Money is necessary
[1/11/23, 4:08:49 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the process I sense what is wrong right now is not the monetization part but the mispricing of a lot of stuff
[1/11/23, 4:09:25 PM] Peter Peng: Agreed 👍
[1/11/23, 4:37:30 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not communism but the “dirty kids” phenomena 

Amongst the nomads there exist this demographics called the “dirty kids”

Basically outcast that are not  trusted by the rest of the folks of the decentralized nomadic community.

Described by one of the ex-military camp lead, who warned me about them when they started appearing on scene, they operate by a very different value system. Will “take” things just because they need it. 

Giving the “dirty kids” the benefit of a doubt, I went and sat amongst them one afternoon to get a sense of their world view. 

They throw around the term “manifest” around a lot. But when you look at it from an objective observer stand point, it is just straight psychological manipulation to get what they want. 

The night before another camp lead who operates a volunteer kitchen came crying to us. One of the “dirty kids” stole all her eggs which she was hoping to use to make quiche to feed the campers. 

Just now while I was at the hot springs outside of slab city, overheard the conversation that someone broke into a camper and stoled a bunch of stuff from the camper (phones and laptops)

I guess in that regard you can’t really know who you can trust unless reputation score is made explicit

[1/11/23, 5:13:43 PM] Peter Peng: With all the tech and bank layoffs
[1/11/23, 5:14:09 PM] Gary Teh: Actually I see it as right sizing. They over hired over the past two years
[1/11/23, 5:15:11 PM] Peter Peng: I think that Web3 has something to do with it
[1/11/23, 5:15:35 PM] Peter Peng: Since it intersects tech and finance
[1/11/23, 5:24:07 PM] Gary Teh: After being offline since before Xmas and then just finally coming back online and seeing the state of Web3, I am seeing with a fresh perspective this web3 phenomena. 

From my perspective right now It’s actually a “hot air”, mainly due to overhyped marketing and not really alot of substance. 🤔

Marketeers are just conflating alot of stuff into this overarching trend right now and calling them web3. 

But if you examine what the real heavy hitters are doing right now. No one is even talking about it anymore
[1/11/23, 5:26:54 PM] Gary Teh: I would actually attribute the prior hiring frenzy to the federal reserve’s unrelenting expansion of the money supply. That artificially elevated all economic activities and made everything look tinted and rosy if you were inside the bubble (the CEOs especially)

[1/11/23, 5:49:05 PM] Tres Garcia: Downsizing is due to the prediction of a lack in the market. JPM and other lenders nailed it when they fired 75% of their staff due to the fed raising rates beyond a threshold and the housing market at an all time listing low….

If they are we could literally extend Edgar to support an entire automated trading strategy around it.
[1/11/23, 10:31:06 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: looking forward to discuss in Davos 🤗
[1/12/23, 7:31:28 AM] Aga - DAOist: It all depends on the community and if they shifted really to "giving" belief system and how big a community is... If they continue to work as "take" or do thinks because they count on return than it is a different frequency.

I stay with my ideals and I am not for tokenizing relationships, especially friendships. Estimating value of it causes more drama is more distruptive than doing things from heart without expectations, being grateful for what we get.
[1/12/23, 11:31:08 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense. 🤩

The entire community needs to “shift” together otherwise the “prisoner dilemma” situation will just surface and everyone will just get booted out of the Garden of Eden 

Another way which surfaced during one of the late night discussions I had with Alison, seems to be for people to return to the Promised Land is via a three stage approach

- stage 1: enlighten people to the way of the Land through education. Once people understand how they can live directly off the land again, they will start seeing abundance and finally loon pass the artificially introduced scarcity that is baked into our current system

- stage 2: grant people access to Land. They can start practicing the abundance that they learn and start experiencing it

- stage 3: incorporate them into the Garden of Eden community when they are past stage 2

The only thing they will get to interact with are the food kitchen

Even the operators of the food kitchen wouldn’t know where the Bitcoin mining facilities are 

You can’t slay the golden goose if you don’t know where it is and you only receive the Golden eggs via airdrops
[1/12/23, 2:00:11 PM] Peter Peng: Sounds like the “dirty kids” need their asses kicked lol I
[1/12/23, 2:00:17 PM] Peter Peng: 😂
[1/12/23, 2:04:15 PM] Gary Teh: Or cleaned up. If everything is free and there are abundance then there is technically nothing to steal

When there are nothing to steal then there will be no thieves 

It’s straight up application of sun Tze’s art of war 

If you address the root cause then all the symptoms will just go away
[1/12/23, 2:09:35 PM] Peter Peng: Free everything would never work at scale
[1/12/23, 2:10:07 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t think humans are wired that way
[1/12/23, 2:10:35 PM] Peter Peng: Since getting resources require levels of effort
[1/12/23, 2:11:04 PM] Peter Peng: And the issue of “fairness” sets in
[1/12/23, 2:18:43 PM] Gary Teh: When I look at it from the nomad perspective, the only key thing that needs to be free is food. 

Shelter is free in the desert so is water. 

Fairness defined around food is simple. Everyone has enough food to feel full
[1/12/23, 2:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: There is only so much calories an average human being needs everyday
[1/12/23, 2:21:56 PM] Peter Peng: But some people eat more than others
[1/12/23, 2:22:19 PM] Peter Peng: It’s human nature
[1/12/23, 2:22:49 PM] Peter Peng: Should be a mix of free food and also additional food for sale
[1/12/23, 2:23:05 PM] Peter Peng: In case someone is hungrier
[1/12/23, 2:25:44 PM] Peter Peng: Right?

[1/12/23, 2:30:27 PM] Peter Peng: Like an accelerometer that makes a parachute 🪂 come out if it’s dropping fast
[1/12/23, 2:32:02 PM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense. Dr Spencer who lives here in slab city was trying to convince me to help build one. Seems someone else has already built it.

I get to save my bandwidth to build something more interesting 🤩
[1/12/23, 2:43:07 PM] Peter Peng: I’m looking into generative AI for robotics.
[1/12/23, 2:43:10 PM] Peter Peng: https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/rt-1-robotics-transformer-for-real.html?m=1
[1/12/23, 4:19:09 PM] Gary Teh: Sounds like fun! 🤩

I believe once we get the desert off grid model working, having an ocean faring off grid model will require the use of robotics to navigate the off grid stand alone platform to clamber waters and places with good sunlight
[1/13/23, 8:25:41 AM] Gary Teh: If this model works for food, am intending to extend it to cover lithium batteries. Since this is what a lot of the nomads rely on for energy storage 

Once that is done, food and energy is covered. Since they are mainly living out of their vehicles, then all three food, energy and shelter checkboxes will have been covered and brought off the grid 🤩

[1/16/23, 3:33:14 AM] Aléksa: Hello everyone,

Happy Monday! 

I wanted to  invite you to join a new group that I have recently created on LinkedIn - Pitch Your DAO! 

Working with DAOs and Web3 projects, I realized that many struggle with at least something and they do not have a feedback system that helps them improve and scale. So I created this group as a platform for Web3 and DAO founders to come together, share ideas and collaborate on projects. 

In this group, you will have the opportunity to pitch your DAO to a community of experienced and passionate individuals, receive feedback, and potentially even find co-founders and contributors, or the help you need to bring your project to life.

I believe that this group has the potential to be a valuable resource for anyone in the Web3 and DAO space, and I would be happy to have you in as a member!

Best,
Aleksa 

P.S. Please feel free to share this invitation with any other Web3 and DAO founders you know, the more the merrier!

Welcome: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9298181/
[1/16/23, 4:31:55 AM] Gary Teh: You should speak to @14152032783and @8618926086648 I believe OffChain  global is pursuing something similar and there are much synergy to be had between the two groups 🙂🙏
[1/16/23, 4:33:33 AM] Aléksa: Checked them out  -  it's very similar, however they are more fancy than I plan to be.😁 And here is more about getting direct feedback in a smaller group, and help each other out.
[1/16/23, 10:07:35 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[1/16/23, 10:09:41 AM] Gary Teh: I know that @48606646246 runs the infinitely open minds group. It’s a smaller group where folks in web3 help each other out. 

Perhaps members from that group might be interesting for you 🙂🙏
[1/16/23, 2:08:38 PM] Aga - DAOist: Indeed, we have an amazing group of people who are experts in web3 but also interested in current world evolution on many levels, including spiritual :) let's catch up if you are looking for some support @381644913030 🤗
[1/16/23, 2:42:15 PM] Aléksa: That sounds interesting, would love to!
‎[1/16/23, 8:00:25 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[1/17/23, 5:31:11 AM] Aléksa: Hello, do you maybe know someone who's working on solving the UX/UI issue in Web3? If you can help me get to someone who is working on that. Thank you!

[1/17/23, 5:40:31 AM] Gary Teh: Easiest way is to decouple the user onboarding experience from web3 

That is how TrueSight.Me is strict right now 

Which project are u looking for help with? 🙂🙏
[1/17/23, 5:42:33 AM] Aléksa: I am looking for a project / person who is working on a solution for this problem.
[1/17/23, 5:47:54 AM] Gary Teh: Try this one

[1/17/23, 5:48:21 AM] Gary Teh: https://web3auth.io/
[1/17/23, 5:48:32 AM] Gary Teh: These two are the solutions that surfaced last year 🙂🙏

[1/18/23, 2:17:50 AM] Brian -IOM: I'm investigating crypto/AI crossovers - it's a no-brainer. I have come up with a hypothesis that we are on the brink of experiencing AI 2.0. OpenAI is an example of AI 2.0 - a centralised data farm. It's why Microsoft is sniffing around. Web3 and crypto are the answer to creating a much more distributed model for AI. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if it's one of crypto's legit "killer apps".
[1/18/23, 2:18:19 AM] Brian -IOM: Let's get busy with AI3 🚀
[1/18/23, 2:20:36 AM] Brian -IOM: Because AI 2.0 is going to be much worse for us than Web 2.0
[1/18/23, 2:21:53 AM] Brian -IOM: That's my shtick! 😉
[1/18/23, 2:32:01 AM] Gary Teh: I believe attributing data contribution to train AI as a form of ownership is the key
[1/18/23, 2:34:43 AM] Brian -IOM: People are already creating AI data marketplaces underpinned by crypto and blockchain
[1/18/23, 2:35:11 AM] Brian -IOM: Let me send you a link to "a conversation" I had with ChatGPT about the topic...
[1/18/23, 2:35:45 AM] Brian -IOM: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bnaughton_conversationswithai-ai-artificialintelligence-activity-7019282310315307009-gHvc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
[1/18/23, 2:38:44 AM] Francois renet: That’s beautiful!
[1/18/23, 2:39:30 AM] Brian -IOM: With one caveat re the ChatGPT response - it's still stuck in 2021 in terms of data.
[1/18/23, 2:39:50 AM] Francois renet: Google just announced their competitor to Open AI called Muse. I retested to find out what it will look like
[1/18/23, 2:40:27 AM] Brian -IOM: Do you know when they launch in terms of public access?
[1/18/23, 2:40:52 AM] Francois renet: Didn’t say. I’m going to find the article and send!
[1/18/23, 2:42:08 AM] Francois renet: https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/01/google-muse-text-to-image/?fbclid=IwAR0tJ8FLUVKGLWOrC3ifqnB8iMh2m5RNgXUbMuOnk4MqK7UnMiKFfu4lim0
[1/18/23, 2:44:25 AM] Brian -IOM: Thanks - the next 18 months are going to be trippy. The next iteration of GPT will be orders of magnitude more powerful.
[1/18/23, 2:45:08 AM] Brian -IOM: And Google/Alphabet has found a way of weaning itself off the sugar rush of online advertising
[1/18/23, 2:45:15 AM] Francois renet: And so will the debates. Schools and colleges already seeing students using to cheat and create their essays!
[1/18/23, 2:45:43 AM] Brian -IOM: I saw that - and NYC school board banning its use
[1/18/23, 2:46:29 AM] Francois renet: Try and enforcing that at home
[1/18/23, 2:47:05 AM] Brian -IOM: Pandora's box 😅
[1/18/23, 2:47:07 AM] Francois renet: And wait for the AI that will analyze tests Year over year to extrapolate what questions could come up on future tests!
[1/18/23, 2:50:13 AM] Brian -IOM: I was asking it about blockchain tech the other day and we had 'a conversation' about Ethereum being PoW but planning to move to PoS. In crypto, 2 years is an eternity - OpenAI's data sets are from 2021!
[1/18/23, 2:51:34 AM] Francois renet: It’s just going to accelerate. I want to see individualized Open AI where artists can upload their creations exclusively to generate more personal artworks. I think that’s a better way to showcase talent
[1/18/23, 2:52:42 AM] Brian -IOM: Well that's the magic of web3 and tokenisation - it's tailor made for overcoming this problem of centralisation of resources, power and value.
[1/18/23, 2:52:53 AM] Francois renet: With some artworks from your favorite artists thrown in for inspiration
[1/18/23, 3:31:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe copyright might be useful to “tame” Ai?
https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558516/ai-art-copyright-stable-diffusion-getty-images-lawsuit
[1/18/23, 3:37:35 AM] Brian -IOM: It's an interesting angle Anita, it certainly needs some checks and balances in place. From this pull quote that talks about the difference between Napster and Spotify, however, one wonders whether or not individual artists will be compensated. Spotify certainly is not providing adequate compensation to artists!
[1/18/23, 3:37:36 AM] Brian -IOM: “I don’t think it’s about damages and it’s not about stopping the distribution of this technology,” Peters told The Verge. “I think there are ways of building generative models that respect intellectual property. I equate [this to] Napster and Spotify. Spotify negotiated with intellectual property rights holders — labels and artists — to create a service. You can debate over whether they’re fairly compensated in that or not, but it’s a negotiation based of the rights of individuals and entities. And that’s what we’re looking for, rather than a singular entity benefiting of the backs of others. That’s the long term goal of this action.”
[1/18/23, 5:04:19 AM] Peter Peng: https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-san-francisco-european-union-7a82416400545f313ff46c0180e606d7
[1/18/23, 5:04:52 AM] Peter Peng: I hate Getty images
[1/18/23, 5:08:57 AM] Peter Peng: I think that this should be treated like any other case. If the image is altered over a certain percentage % then it should be allowed as the AI used the image as inspiration as a normal artist would
[1/18/23, 6:06:45 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sounds reasonable. however, the difference is: a human being can never work at a scale and pace like an AI system. so the fine mechanisms of copyright are not fully applicable to me anymore. also copyright is part of an entire«eco» system. to me it does not fit anymore. it feels like some people are getting insanely rich on the back of the others.
[1/18/23, 6:07:43 AM] Anita Lamprecht: nobody will want to do the «non-scalable» jobs anymore. we will be in trouble without robots. 😂
[1/18/23, 6:07:57 AM] Brian -IOM: In standard artistic practices, this would be a question of whether or not a work was considered "derivative" or a "copy". Andy Warhol's works, for example, would be considered derivative works - sufficiently so to be considered new works in their own right. But he did have to pay Disney to use Mickey Mouse. And in music, even an audio sample/snippet that is used in a new work can be considered a copyright infringement. So perhaps it's all to play for until we establish some kind of legal precedent.
[1/18/23, 6:11:01 AM] Peter Peng: This is why it’s important that AI is intertwined with Web3. The method of tokenization allows creators to be rewarded based in thier efforts rendering marketplaces like Getty obsolete (thankfully)
[1/18/23, 6:11:59 AM] Brian -IOM: Lots of Warhol's images - Mao, Elvis, Marilyn, etc. - were based on photos considered to already be in the public domain. With Elvis and Marilyn, they were film studio stills circulated under an open license to the media so they could publicise the films in print.
[1/18/23, 6:12:24 AM] Brian -IOM: So that's how he got around one or two of the potential copyright strikes
[1/18/23, 6:12:47 AM] Peter Peng: AI is unstoppable
[1/18/23, 6:13:04 AM] Brian -IOM: totally
[1/18/23, 6:13:09 AM] Peter Peng: It’s like trying to stop a calculator
[1/18/23, 6:13:17 AM] Peter Peng: Everyone needs it
[1/18/23, 6:13:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: that's part of the social contract :0) some things are allowed and some are not. and that's why we have judges to balance exactly those questions again and again. AI just is so fast... hard to keep up on the legal side.
[1/18/23, 6:14:05 AM] Peter Peng: I love it
[1/18/23, 6:14:13 AM] Brian -IOM: Much better to devote time to how to make it more decentralised I think - rather than trying to resist it
[1/18/23, 6:14:33 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, I’ve been doing this for years
[1/18/23, 6:14:38 AM] Anita Lamprecht: yes .. maybe. that's why i am here .. learning from you 🙏
[1/18/23, 6:14:52 AM] Peter Peng: Figuring out how humanity can scale with AI
[1/18/23, 6:15:15 AM] Peter Peng: I believe the answer is the blockchain as the DNA of AI
[1/18/23, 6:16:20 AM] Brian -IOM: I don't think AI marketplaces can work without crypto for one. Imagaine trying to rig something like that up to TradFi!
[1/18/23, 6:16:22 AM] Anita Lamprecht: is blockchain fast enough for AI?
[1/18/23, 6:16:48 AM] Anita Lamprecht: sorry for the question ... i am just a lawyer 😆
[1/18/23, 6:16:48 AM] Brian -IOM: Yes - esp compared to the alternative!
[1/18/23, 6:16:52 AM] Peter Peng: No but it can slow it down 🙂
[1/18/23, 6:17:20 AM] Anita Lamprecht: you mean humans ?😄
[1/18/23, 6:17:21 AM] Peter Peng: Governments should leverage blockchain to regulate it
[1/18/23, 6:18:26 AM] Peter Peng: We haven’t seen anything yet, ChatGPT is child’s play
[1/18/23, 6:18:27 AM] Brian -IOM: No cryptocurrencies as the foundation for an AI economy. The alternative being Visa, Mastercard and PayPal!
[1/18/23, 6:19:16 AM] Anita Lamprecht: copy
[1/18/23, 6:31:00 AM] Peter Peng: Exactly
[1/18/23, 1:42:17 PM] Peter Peng: Good news, I’ve finally got my own version of ChatGPT going using open source technology for GPTprotocol.com. Bad News is that it takes up A LOT of server power to run. 😅

Right now we have holdings in @41799155602 Earn.games and @14075792560 JetsonX 

We should expect to have holdings in LANUR.Swiss next week once we kick start the tokenization process 🤩

[1/18/23, 4:58:48 PM] Garis Pang: Seriously? Cut the payrolls for the sake of reinvesting it that piece of 💩 ?!
[1/18/23, 5:01:20 PM] Peter Peng: Blame Elon Musk
[1/18/23, 5:01:47 PM] Garis Pang: Please explain why?
[1/18/23, 5:02:29 PM] Peter Peng: He’s a cofounder and started pumping it after he bought Twitter
[1/18/23, 5:02:57 PM] Garis Pang: Cofounder of OpenAI ?
‎[1/18/23, 5:03:32 PM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[1/18/23, 5:04:19 PM] Peter Peng: Dall-E and ChatGTP started trending on Twitter after he took control
[1/18/23, 5:04:34 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not complaining
[1/18/23, 5:05:50 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like they pushed Elon Musk out though…
[1/18/23, 5:05:55 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure
[1/18/23, 5:06:07 PM] Garis Pang: Of course you are not. Appreciate your sharing. And does OpenAI start to break even or profitable yet?
[1/18/23, 5:06:41 PM] Peter Peng: No but they are coming out with a paid Pro version
[1/18/23, 5:07:38 PM] Peter Peng: The deal with Microsoft is that they get 75% profits until all $10b is paid back and then they own 45% of the company
[1/18/23, 5:07:46 PM] Garis Pang: ChatGTP making waves globally now, is OpenAI be shaken by it?
[1/18/23, 5:08:35 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGTP is owned by OpenAI
[1/18/23, 5:09:10 PM] Peter Peng: I’m making a Web3 version
[1/18/23, 5:09:36 PM] Garis Pang: Dall-E is another similar version by other competitor?
[1/18/23, 5:09:38 PM] Peter Peng: Because I’m a bit creeped out that one centralized entity owns it
[1/18/23, 5:10:02 PM] Peter Peng: Dall-E is owned by OpenAI
[1/18/23, 5:10:14 PM] Peter Peng: We all use similar technology
[1/18/23, 5:10:19 PM] Garis Pang: Then create a decentralized AI system then 🤣
[1/18/23, 5:10:41 PM] Peter Peng: I did, I just got it working today

[1/18/23, 5:13:14 PM] Garis Pang: I will ask your AI to code scripts
[1/18/23, 5:13:27 PM] Peter Peng: It can
[1/18/23, 5:14:47 PM] Peter Peng: It’s pretrained on a dataset called “the Pile” which is 800GB of data
[1/18/23, 5:15:01 PM] Garis Pang: Not sure is there any limitation on particular programming languages in replying me based on my requests?
[1/18/23, 5:15:33 PM] Peter Peng: I need to test it out more but the intelligence is spot on with ChatGTP
[1/18/23, 5:16:03 PM] Peter Peng: I can also train it on custom datasets and make it smarter
[1/18/23, 5:16:04 PM] Garis Pang: Assuming that I want a C++ coding scripts in return, how? Can?
[1/18/23, 5:16:50 PM] Peter Peng: Right now my version is a bit slower than ChatGTP, I need more powerful GPU servers
[1/18/23, 5:17:00 PM] Peter Peng: Which are $$$
[1/18/23, 5:18:04 PM] Garis Pang: Any Free sources online?
[1/18/23, 5:18:19 PM] Peter Peng: Unfortunately not
[1/18/23, 5:18:37 PM] Peter Peng: I can find investors though
[1/18/23, 5:19:01 PM] Peter Peng: I prefer to create a foundation or DAO though
[1/18/23, 5:19:06 PM] Garis Pang: I think a lot of miners own the hardware of it, can contact them maybe?
[1/18/23, 5:19:18 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe
[1/18/23, 5:19:24 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t know any
[1/18/23, 5:20:00 PM] Peter Peng: So maybe give them tokens if they host for us
[1/18/23, 5:20:09 PM] Peter Peng: That would be cool
[1/18/23, 5:20:37 PM] Garis Pang: Tons of miners given up mining operations and the hardwares are redundant lying around.
[1/18/23, 5:22:00 PM] Peter Peng: I have a gaming PC I might be able to use

[1/18/23, 10:19:22 PM] Gary Teh: How can we get our hands on those? 

Was chatting with @12023686334 about the solar powered Bitcoin mining operation in the desert

We could reserved some of those machines to power the web3 AI that @14075792560 is right now training

[1/18/23, 10:32:10 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like the human design  system that @48606646246 recommended had been playing out naturally. In my case, the hermit profile. 

Haven’t really bothered to network during my time here. Somehow it the right people seem to get attracted into my gravitational field without any efforts on my part. 

Another house mate (who heads a family office branch) who heard the story of how I stumbled right into the desert nomadic tribe when I was just attempting to find a private spot in the desert for my year end retreat mentioned the right people will just naturally gravitate towards this energy frequency (whatever it is) which I have been emitting out into the ethers

[1/19/23, 3:20:44 AM] Peter Peng: I want my AI to be so powerful I’d need my own nuclear power plant to run all the GPUs 😂
[1/19/23, 3:22:26 AM] Peter Peng: Or several nuclear power plants
[1/19/23, 4:20:43 AM] Tres Garcia: Yeah. 1x trick pony that can mine a specific coin(s)… no AI here
[1/19/23, 4:21:40 AM] Tres Garcia: Challenge to @14075792560: figure out a way to solve AI problems using old ASIC miners
[1/19/23, 4:22:24 AM] Tres Garcia: Probably less expensive vs GPU on the equipment side. Will need that nuclear plant to break even on the energy cost!
[1/19/23, 4:22:31 AM] Tres Garcia: 🤣😂🤣
[1/19/23, 4:28:07 AM] Brian -IOM: 😂 the gauntlet has been thrown down! Seriously though, mining bitcoin will finance off-grid (decentralised) energy production. 😉

[1/21/23, 3:30:50 PM] Gary Teh: Some updates that might be of interest 

AID has been well received. We are right now helping work through a variant that would be suitable for implementation in the House of Balance. 

Solar powered Bitcoin mining has been really really well received. The CEO of EthicalFin seem really keen on participating. Getting a quotation for land price in Namibia from another contact. 

There might be potential for the same Namibian contact to become a partner to further extend EcoVerse21 into Namibia. Will also be having a follow up with the CEO of shareitt to explore partnering since they already have a very extensive network in Africa 

While listening in on various discussions, a variant of the cypher defense idea focused on Impact investing surfaced. We will be exploring how we could implement AID within this scope as part of our contribution. That variant will be implemented within the house of balance ecosystem since that ecosystem is squarely positioned within the social impact investing space.  

The city of Davos is looking to implement some AI based solutions. Their adjunct mayor has made an introduction to the relevant person in charge, having a follow up meeting to discuss how we can contribute next weekend. 

That is all for now 🙂🙏
[1/21/23, 3:36:28 PM] Peter Peng: Great update
[1/21/23, 3:39:13 PM] Gary Teh: ShareItt is already fully tokenized so we will end up having a bunch of their tokens in our vault if collaborations goes through

[1/21/23, 3:57:05 PM] Peter Peng: That’s the vibe I’m getting
[1/21/23, 3:57:56 PM] Peter Peng: China and Russia continues and will continue to be a non - threat to the changing world order
[1/21/23, 9:58:23 PM] Jonathan: Gary if you need more insight into land in Africa do contact me
[1/21/23, 10:01:02 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. Will reach out to schedule a chat beginning of Feb. travel and meeting schedule seems quite packed the rest of this month 🙂

[1/23/23, 4:14:43 AM] Gary Teh: Was thinking through the dataset we already have in our database, I believe the next time the Federal reserve reverses the direction of interest rates we should have enough quantitative data to get a sense of when reverse will be happening 

That should help inform capital deployment decisions. This is most especially once the solar powered Bitcoin mining operations gets up and running in the desert. 

I am thinking it will mainly be managing the portion that is kept in Bitcoin versus the portion kept on USDT.

[1/23/23, 9:32:56 AM] Brian -IOM: Does it work on WaPo and NYT?!
[1/23/23, 11:39:01 AM] Gary Teh: Who knows 🤷‍♂️

Will find out soon enough 

By the way the contact in Namibia is linking us directly to their government’s ministry 

I wonder if we should do the same with Kenya. Realized on the final day, one of our house mates works in the ministry for Kenya

[1/24/23, 2:39:04 AM] Gary Teh: Alitheum is looking to raise USD1 million to tackle the problem of fake news by implementing a technology solution

This is a use case that we have tackled through some technology implementation via Edgar.

When browsing through their team configuration it does not seem like they have a technology expert yet

Will be having a discussion with their team next week

What I am considering right now is “investing” our existing technology implementation into their company in exchange for a portion of shares that will be issued for their current USD1 million raise.

These shares will become part of our DAO’s holding

Will submit this for voting by our governors once I have finished discussions with their team.

If both sides are receptive, we will follow through with this line of execution 🙂🙏
[1/24/23, 2:42:44 AM] Gary Teh: Seems based on the current prevailing trend, moving forward our DAO will increasingly have holdings in projects that are aligned with our values

Valuation for our governance tokens will increasingly resemble the Singapore dollar. The value of that countries currency is basically backed by a collection of other currencies that it has trading ties to. 🤔
[1/24/23, 2:46:42 AM] Gary Teh: We will be having a physical meetup this coming Monday in zürich with @41791555798 @19514467219 @41765737357 and Gunter

topics we would like to cover during our session include:

1. How should on chain organization models that have gradual decentralization baked into their tokenomics be legally represented off chain

2. How do companies utilize tokenization to support circular economics. Gunther ⁩will also spend sometime to walk us through his project SPIN

[1/24/23, 2:06:58 PM] Gary Teh: Germany (NATO) just gave the go ahead for Poland (NATO) to donate their leopard tanks to Ukraine 

Meanwhile Chinese companies were identified to be supporting Russian war efforts 

Inside sources at Davos indicate next year is going to be quite bad from a geopolitical perspective

[1/25/23, 7:16:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: War in Syria took years…. Intentionally
[1/25/23, 7:16:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: Step 1. Create a war

Step 2. Create a budget to fund war

Step 3. Assign budget to other country as aid and claim heroic status. 

Step 4. Pay ownself to manufacture equipment for war using that aid. So own war factories earn a full market priced revenue. 
 
Step 5. Send that equipment to other country and claim heroic status

Step 6. Record in books that other country owes you the full retail cost of those weapons in step 4.

Step 7. Get to build factories, take materials, free domination of land, or even future cash as repayment for weapons. 

Step 8. Report to government that instantly you flip investment 2x. Because 1 aid = money to self + money other owes you for equipment you made and “gave”. 

Step 9. Create another war again once this is over.
[1/25/23, 7:16:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s business
[1/25/23, 7:17:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Instant 2x returns.
[1/25/23, 7:17:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Look at japan. Drop an atomic bomb. Conquered the country. What do u get in return?
[1/25/23, 7:18:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: U get to build military bases in japan. And japan jumps to your back and call whenever u need to threaten China
[1/25/23, 7:18:31 PM] Kelvin Chew: And every year japan sends huge amount of cash to usa as yearly tribute for being a good slave?
[1/25/23, 7:18:41 PM] Peter Peng: We’ll do the same with Russia
[1/25/23, 7:18:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Where is this tribute? The 1.1Trillion of USA bonds
[1/25/23, 7:19:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Correct
[1/25/23, 7:19:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: But over Ukraine
[1/25/23, 7:19:17 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa will own every Ukrainian ass
[1/25/23, 7:19:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: When it’s done
[1/25/23, 7:19:31 PM] Peter Peng: We will demilitarize them since they violated the rules of engagement regarding war
[1/25/23, 7:19:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: Nah. Why do that. Keep them fighting. American war factories need to build weapons
[1/25/23, 7:19:56 PM] Peter Peng: We will demilitarize Russia
[1/25/23, 7:20:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: U can’t build bullets if u don’t have people to shoot them with
[1/25/23, 7:20:29 PM] Peter Peng: They aren’t using weapons responsibly
[1/25/23, 7:20:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: Drag the war out. As long as possible. Each usa tank is 10million revenue
[1/25/23, 7:21:11 PM] Peter Peng: Nah, just end it
[1/25/23, 7:21:16 PM] Kelvin Chew: Send 10. American factories get 100m of government funds.
[1/25/23, 7:21:23 PM] Peter Peng: Why waste time and resources
[1/25/23, 7:21:29 PM] Kelvin Chew: And usa gets an IOU from ukraine for another 100M
[1/25/23, 7:21:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: Instant 2x

[1/25/23, 7:23:17 PM] Kelvin Chew: The American government does
[1/25/23, 7:23:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s the business of the country
[1/25/23, 7:23:26 PM] Peter Peng: It’s about energy
[1/25/23, 7:23:31 PM] Peter Peng: And power
[1/25/23, 7:23:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s what the Iraq war gives America. The prize is oil

[1/25/23, 7:24:02 PM] Peter Peng: It’s about control
[1/25/23, 7:24:14 PM] Peter Peng: The most responsible controls
[1/25/23, 7:24:37 PM] Peter Peng: God decides who is the most powerful
[1/25/23, 7:25:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: Yes that too. Now Ukraine has to give usa land to build bases and to put missiles
[1/25/23, 7:25:37 PM] Peter Peng: They welcome it
[1/25/23, 7:25:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: Of course. Didn’t u read?
[1/25/23, 7:26:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Once this Ukraine conquest is done. The next war will come within 2 years
[1/25/23, 7:26:51 PM] Kelvin Chew: Just watch. It’s repeating for the last few decades
[1/25/23, 7:26:58 PM] Peter Peng: If Putin wasn’t abusing his power this would never happen
[1/25/23, 7:27:18 PM] Kelvin Chew: Putin was baited. Trapped
[1/25/23, 7:27:25 PM] Kelvin Chew: He fell for it.
[1/25/23, 7:27:44 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, one wrong move
[1/25/23, 7:28:04 PM] Peter Peng: Checkmate
[1/25/23, 7:28:27 PM] Peter Peng: We beat the Russians at their own game
[1/25/23, 7:28:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: Why do u think america had to withdraw troops in afghanistan so rapidly
[1/25/23, 7:28:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: They know they have bigger fish to fry
[1/25/23, 7:29:07 PM] Kelvin Chew: Afghanistan is not profitable anymore
[1/25/23, 7:29:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Usa always makes one war at a time
[1/25/23, 7:29:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: It’s all carefully orchestrated
[1/25/23, 7:30:04 PM] Peter Peng: We don’t make war, we get involved in every war
[1/25/23, 7:30:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: U think the 20% defense budget pays itself?
[1/25/23, 7:30:52 PM] Peter Peng: We get paid to get involved
[1/25/23, 7:31:00 PM] Kelvin Chew: For a savvy smart business man like yourself. I am amaze u still don’t see it
[1/25/23, 7:32:01 PM] Peter Peng: We have a responsibility to the world to make sure everyone is protected by tyrants
[1/25/23, 7:32:38 PM] Peter Peng: We are like the protective big brother
[1/25/23, 7:33:20 PM] Peter Peng: The US are the biggest gangster
[1/25/23, 7:34:33 PM] Peter Peng: Russia and China are all talk
[1/25/23, 7:35:39 PM] Peter Peng: We will show them who god really is…

[1/25/23, 7:47:29 PM] Peter Peng: Under my regime, if Xi or Putin even blinks the wrong way, I’ll make very quick decision… just to send a message and exercise my power.
[1/25/23, 7:48:55 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t like to waste time.
[1/25/23, 8:11:11 PM] Peter Peng: Anyways! On a more positive note https://m.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/goldman-sachs-ranks-btc-above-gold-real-estate-and-22-other-assets-2987349?ampMode=1

[1/26/23, 5:26:06 AM] Gary Teh: @2348123243309 is helping setup an African based conference with AI focus. We are right now looking for more speakers on that subject 

I know that @16506464893 had done some work in that area as well in the healthcare industry in his previous startup

He might be good as a speaker 🙂🙏
[1/26/23, 7:43:13 AM] Peter Peng: Love your outfit
[1/26/23, 7:48:47 AM] Peter Peng: We don’t go an purposefully make war or want a war, which is why we would rather drop a bomb and end it… so you need to stop placing this false narrative that we (US) go around looking for a war.
[1/26/23, 7:50:44 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe it’s time to repeal the Geneva Convention to show Putin what we are talking about.
[1/26/23, 7:53:12 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe even throw one down on China for releasing Covid-19
[1/26/23, 7:53:57 AM] Peter Peng: If the East wants to play dirty
[1/26/23, 7:59:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: Curious though. Could u enlighten me why covid was found in the more remote states of usa before covid was found in wuhan China?
[1/26/23, 7:59:46 AM] Kelvin Chew: Cos I don’t really understand the chronology
[1/26/23, 8:00:55 AM] Peter Peng: China was mutating the virus in a lab
[1/26/23, 8:01:08 AM] Peter Peng: And released it
[1/26/23, 8:01:17 AM] Peter Peng: Purposely
[1/26/23, 8:02:01 AM] Peter Peng: It was thier attempt to take over the West
[1/26/23, 8:02:05 AM] Kelvin Chew: https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/01/940395651/coronavirus-was-in-u-s-weeks-earlier-than-previously-known-study-says
[1/26/23, 8:02:45 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s quite amazing China can hit all those states before the place they usually land in after flying into usa.
[1/26/23, 8:03:18 AM] Peter Peng: The Chinese government has state run media, of course they won’t admit to having it there first.
[1/26/23, 8:03:47 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the proper with an authoritarian government
[1/26/23, 8:03:55 AM] Kelvin Chew: And usa will readily admit to having the virus first that killed the world?
[1/26/23, 8:03:57 AM] Peter Peng: Problem
[1/26/23, 8:05:19 AM] Kelvin Chew: But then again 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/iraq-war-wmds-an-intelligence-failure-or-white-house-spin/
[1/26/23, 8:05:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: Western media is never controlled to say any lies
[1/26/23, 8:06:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: Usa clearly reported Iraq had WMDs right? So that must be the absolute truth
[1/26/23, 8:06:55 AM] Kelvin Chew: So u are right. China released covid to the world
[1/26/23, 8:07:00 AM] Kelvin Chew: Good job
[1/26/23, 8:07:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: Makes sense to kill themselves and shut down their entire economy for 2 years
[1/26/23, 8:07:27 AM] Peter Peng: They were trying to build them along with chemical and biological weapons. The chemical weapons ended up being used in Syria
[1/26/23, 8:08:56 AM] Peter Peng: They did, the Chinese government did
[1/26/23, 8:11:18 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yup. If the American media says so. Then it must be true
[1/26/23, 8:16:41 AM] Peter Peng: For the past 3 years there has been an agressive attempt for the East to take over the West. Since China’s Covid19 attempt failed, Putin has now tried… and is failing. Give up already.
[1/26/23, 8:18:03 AM] Kelvin Chew: Give up what? This war has nothing to do with me. Lol
[1/26/23, 8:18:20 AM] Peter Peng: The sun may rise in the East, but it sets in the West. “Lights out”
[1/26/23, 8:20:02 AM] Peter Peng: Stop trying to blame the US
[1/26/23, 8:21:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: Of course not. Who dares to blame US
[1/26/23, 8:21:57 AM] Kelvin Chew: Even when Nordstream got blown up. The world just shuts up
[1/26/23, 8:22:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s foolish to blame the usa at all
[1/26/23, 8:22:25 AM] Peter Peng: We are the peacekeeper, and we don’t do it by being pacifists like Ghandi… 😈 this is why the Pentagon is in the shape of a Pentagram
[1/26/23, 8:23:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: Thank you for keeping the world safe from Vietnam

[1/26/23, 8:24:50 AM] Kelvin Chew: Of course
[1/26/23, 8:25:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: Thank u for keeping the world safe
[1/26/23, 8:25:42 AM] Peter Peng: You’re welcome
[1/26/23, 8:28:56 AM] Peter Peng: This is what the Chinese and communist did to my ancestors so I don’t feel bad at all

[1/26/23, 8:31:24 AM] Peter Peng: The west was on the verge of becoming like this if China and Russia are not stopped
[1/26/23, 8:34:24 AM] Kelvin Chew: U are Cambodian? Sorry for your loss
[1/26/23, 8:34:50 AM] Peter Peng: The false ideology they communism works is a utopian dream that could never work because humans are not born equal and have different levels of motivation. The system is actually extremely corrupt because the very small few at the top 🔝 control everything
[1/26/23, 8:35:03 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, my parents are refugees
[1/26/23, 8:35:56 AM] Peter Peng: We had to change our last name to Peng (a Chinese one) in order to come to America
[1/26/23, 8:36:02 AM] Kelvin Chew: I don’t disagree
[1/26/23, 8:36:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: Every system has a flaw
[1/26/23, 8:36:56 AM] Peter Peng: Capitalism isn’t perfect but it works the best so far
[1/26/23, 8:36:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe u should change it away though seeing u have a hatred for Chinese
[1/26/23, 8:37:52 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t hate them, but I don’t like that they threaten Western democracy
[1/26/23, 8:39:22 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why if it came down to it, we’d have to drop a bomb…
[1/26/23, 8:39:50 AM] Peter Peng: It would be a sad and tough decision to make.
[1/26/23, 8:40:32 AM] Peter Peng: We don’t go around looking for war, but rather want to protect people around the world.
[1/26/23, 8:40:41 AM] Peter Peng: It’s not about money.
[1/26/23, 8:42:25 AM] Peter Peng: It’s about freedom
[1/26/23, 8:43:20 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys. I’m following the East versus West conversation. Entertaining.
[1/26/23, 8:44:30 AM] Francois renet: Have you considered that it is not a continental conflict but rather that it comes from a bigger manipulation?
[1/26/23, 8:49:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: That what I have been saying all along
[1/26/23, 8:49:36 AM] Kelvin Chew: It’s one giant manupilation
[1/26/23, 8:51:22 AM] Kelvin Chew: And just for anyone who has lost track. I am NOT from China at all.
‎[1/26/23, 8:59:20 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[1/26/23, 9:00:20 AM] Peter Peng: It’s fine, I have lots of Chinese friends
[1/26/23, 9:00:55 AM] Peter Peng: They hate their government too, same with my Russian friends
[1/26/23, 9:01:09 AM] Peter Peng: They want to be like America
[1/26/23, 9:04:24 AM] Peter Peng: My dream is that wars will be fought in the Metaverse and that political decisions will be decided on who has more “kills” inside of a game.
[1/26/23, 9:05:09 AM] Kelvin Chew: That I agree. Killing in the metaverse to replace physical wars is ideal
[1/26/23, 9:06:24 AM] Peter Peng: If we can use blockchain to make Metaverse land more valuable than land in the real world then it will incentivize nations to fight wars inside the metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:06:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: Each country should be given plots of land and weapons and troops according to their real world possessions. Develop a new war tech and build it. You gain a NFT or something to represent it in the metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:07:04 AM] Kelvin Chew: Then u fight. What u lose in that virtual place u lose in reality. Minus actual lives
[1/26/23, 9:07:22 AM] Francois renet: That is literally impossible I think. Land in the Metaverse is infinite. When it becomes to valuable and unattainable people will just create another Metaverse
[1/26/23, 9:07:30 AM] Kelvin Chew: So if u can’t hold land there. U can’t hold it in the real world
[1/26/23, 9:07:36 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe we can all get paid to play video games for a living… every kid’s dream
[1/26/23, 9:08:12 AM] Francois renet: People. Seriously. You’re just moving the problem from one space to another. The solution is changing the way we operate as humans.
[1/26/23, 9:08:32 AM] Francois renet: We have the knowledge. We have the tools. Let’s get it done
[1/26/23, 9:08:53 AM] Peter Peng: So we should just fight aliens then
[1/26/23, 9:09:02 AM] Peter Peng: Bring humans together
[1/26/23, 9:09:33 AM] Kelvin Chew: Aliens would avoid us. Who wants to be involved with a species so barbaric that kills each other for fun
[1/26/23, 9:09:57 AM] Francois renet: Here is my theory on that. Whenever I’ve managed very big teams I always had one awhile on the team. Everyone else was United around hating that one person!
[1/26/23, 9:10:28 AM] Francois renet: One asshole on the team. Frikkin autocorrect!
[1/26/23, 9:10:42 AM] Peter Peng: I think we should all ban together and hate Elon Muska
[1/26/23, 9:10:49 AM] Peter Peng: *Elon Musk
[1/26/23, 9:12:55 AM] Peter Peng: He’s been manipulating the world for way too long
[1/26/23, 9:14:03 AM] Francois renet: Agree 100000000%
[1/26/23, 9:15:15 AM] Peter Peng: Now that he’s losing influence I feel much more free
[1/26/23, 9:15:47 AM] Peter Peng: And I also feel like the world is getting back to normal
[1/26/23, 9:18:04 AM] Francois renet: Or is it the calm before the storm?
[1/26/23, 9:18:31 AM] Peter Peng: I think his time is up
[1/26/23, 9:19:41 AM] Peter Peng: He doesn’t understand politics
[1/26/23, 9:20:15 AM] Peter Peng: Global politics
[1/26/23, 9:27:03 AM] Francois renet: I was referring to the world in general. I think it all hinges on what will happen in Ukraine as far as NATO members position. Zelenskyy is definitely trying to light the fuse that will blow the conflict. We’d be better served going into Russia quietly and ridding the problem.
[1/26/23, 9:28:20 AM] Peter Peng: I think we need to do it from the inside out
[1/26/23, 9:32:12 AM] Peter Peng: I’m very well respected amongst the Russian mafia (I married one of their daughters)
[1/26/23, 9:33:40 AM] Francois renet: That’s a double edge sword @14075792560 ! Great when the going is good but yikes if you piss her off! 😂

It really helps to focus on the why!
[1/28/23, 2:14:14 AM] Youna Kim: Hey guys!
 you might be all in Austrian! I’m in Vienna at the moment. super!
[1/28/23, 10:16:39 PM] Gary Teh: Seems a lot of people are looking into mixing AI and Web3 right now thanks for the recent popularity of ChatGpt

I am aware that @14075792560 is also looking at creating one using the AI that he recently deployed on his local computer 🤩

This is the latest one introduced by @436608133615 that is already listed on the exchange 

https://singularitynet.io/

From my perspective the value of these use cases largely depends on the use case they are focused on tackling 

Worst deployments are those that are deployment hoping to find a relevant use case. Burning through cash while not knowing why they are burning through cash. From my experience studying AI startups in general most of these either end up becoming consulting companies or just die a natural death. 

@16506464893 previous startup in the healthcare vertical had a nice deployment since they were already positioned squarely along where the data pipeline is flowing and the use case naturally arose to them because of the nature of their market positioning
[1/28/23, 10:42:10 PM] Gary Teh: @447492703707 happy to find out more of the use case you are trying to tackle with BrightNFT 🙂🙏

Personal experience working on AI models. There is a lot of manual offline research before automation via AI

[1/29/23, 2:13:41 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of AI it might be interesting for both @14075792560 and @447492703707 to present your AI focused projects at the online conference that @2348123243309 is in the process of organizing 🙂🙏
[1/29/23, 2:14:30 AM] The Beer Hall: ‎You added Arie Ben David and Katherina 
[1/29/23, 2:14:48 AM] Brian -IOM: Would love to chat and thanks for the links. Singularity net is definitely a contender. Our base case hypothesis is that there will be such a thing as an AI economy within 5 years. And that it cannot run on TradFi rails. In other words, the convergence of AI and crypto is inevitable. We are tapping NFTs as the ownership layer for individuals to participate in the AI economy. Specifically dynamic NFTs that can represent evolving AI applications and models.
[1/29/23, 2:16:13 AM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me that there might be interesting synergy between the projects that @972556609556 @41762654166 @491736386942 @4915209984105 and @12063955455 are working on

Thematically they revolve around decentralized social mining 

If we could somehow combine our resources I believe the resultant social mining ecosystem will be phenomenal 🤩
[1/29/23, 2:18:54 AM] Brian -IOM: I have been wondering about a “Napster” for BTC mining for a while but I’ve no idea if SETI type distributed processing models will work for hash power
[1/29/23, 2:22:11 AM] Gary Teh: Mind sharing more on SETI? 🙂

[1/29/23, 2:25:45 AM] Brian -IOM: This but for Bitcoin? Don’t know if it will work because the sha256 side of things required the right kind of architecture
[1/29/23, 2:25:58 AM] Gary Teh: I just recalled @41799155602 is also doing social mining within the scope of his project too. This theme seem to be gaining momentum over the past few months 🤩
[1/29/23, 2:28:04 AM] Gary Teh: I believe if we could figure out a working prototype via the sun mint project (solar powered Bitcoin mining in the middle of nowhere/desert)  we could easily replicate and scale it 

Also during our discussions with @972556609556 and @41762654166 what might be really interesting is to implement biodynamic practices to restore the excess land and bring back nature 🤩

[1/29/23, 2:36:47 AM] Brian -IOM: Normally mining pools work the other way around - you purchase compute power on a centralised rig and are rewarded commensurately. The other way around, your free processing power would be accessed by the mining pool to run on your own machine(s). But the real question is if I have (for example) an M2 Mac Mini, how can its processing power be harnessed for mining BTC?
[1/29/23, 2:43:45 AM] Gary Teh: That would be something that @12063955455 could answer

Their distributed computing cloud they have setup is doing exactly that

[1/29/23, 2:53:45 AM] Gary Teh: Just added @41796560010 who is a recent contributor to our EcoVerse21 and SunMiny project as well 

She has a lot of connections in Namibia and has been helping us with sourcing for both land and produce from Namibia 

@2348123243309 perhaps the African focused online AI themed tech conference you are organizing might be interesting for her network there too 🙂🙏
[1/29/23, 3:10:18 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Amazing. Thanks, kindly 🙏🏼
[1/29/23, 3:10:55 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Hope I'm allowed to chat with them @14153000019

And I finally got to meet @41791555798 in person

We discussed a bunch about tokenization within the Swiss legal environment as well as explored more deeply the project that @41791555798 is working on

I believe we will be hearing more from her about the project over the next few days 

Be popping by in zUg later to catch up with @19514467219 and @41764735824 🤩🙏

Was further thinking through the financing aspects of the solar powered Bitcoin mining project in the desert

Since we are procuring undeveloped land, we could Theoretically bump up its valuation after a slight amount of development and then secure loans using it as collateral. We will then utilize these loans to procure the equipment to do off grid Bitcoin mining 

Seems if structured properly we might not even need to inject our own fiat to finance this project instead of the current USD16K we need right now based on our estimates

In that regard the only thing we really need then is expertise and raw manpower. These we can easily support via our DAO

[2/2/23, 1:46:18 AM] Iwona Fluda: How about checking if there is a waste land to buy in Antarctica (here it will need to be checked). But! During summer in Antarctica between Oct and Feb, the sky is never dark. Around the summer solstice, the sun is visible 24 hours a day. 🙃
[2/2/23, 1:46:43 AM] Iwona Fluda: Put this sentence on Blockchain 🤩
[2/2/23, 1:55:08 AM] Gary Teh: Seems Antarctica is technically not ownablr by anybody since it is a continent that is dedicated for research purposes 

I wonder how to get this “experiment” of ours to qualify as research
[2/2/23, 1:55:32 AM] Iwona Fluda: Well, it looks like it's not possible because there is no official authority, which means it belongs to everyone
[2/2/23, 1:56:32 AM] Gary Teh: Maybe it would be good to establish a universal record of all human knowledge there

[2/2/23, 4:10:43 AM] Gary Teh: That is a very rich source of knowledge they have already gathered 

Let’s see what gets discovered during this upcoming trip 🤩
[2/2/23, 4:20:04 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. We have definitely experienced regime change from a market perspective 

It’s been fascinating to observe the various regime changes since 2020

2020 every time “coronavirus” mention spikes the market goes down 

2021 everytime “lockdown” mention spikes the market goes down

2022 everytime “inflation” mention spikes the market goes down

2023 everytime “inflation” mention spikes the market goes up  

Will probably make a note of these regime changes and the various correlations I was looking at so that it could be referenced easily in the future when similar patterns play out again in the future

From my perspective this skewered reporting on companies by the media is another manifestation of fake news that has potential to be very impactful 

All the negative publicity about their side experiment into metaverse which distracted investor attention away from the fact their three platform are still the only one that provides direct access to around 30% of the world’s population caused it to be mispriced quite a few months

Startups do a lot of side experiments all the time to test what works. Even our DAO have been conducting a whole bunch of these (discovering, testing and then killing or doubling down on value aligned projects)

Also the positive effects of laying employee in tech companies (in terms of communication overheads) have been very well documented in Reed Hastings book when 30% of employees were let go. Share price further tanked when this news was released two months ago

[2/3/23, 12:32:45 AM] Gary Teh: Based on the inputs I have gathered from various DAO members, it seems it might make sense to have a once a month face time where interested members can attend if they are keen and available. 

The format I have in mind for these monthly online session is simple. 


1. - a quick walk through of how our governance works 
    - our rubric
    - our ledger 
    - how governance tokens are being awarded
    - how are members rotated to become governors
    - what are the existing functions/privileges are available for governors
    - what are the existing functions/privileges are available for token holders

2. - open format discussions where attendees can feel free to surface anything they feel other attendees of the session might find interesting to discuss about.

Part 1 - should be relatively short - around 10 minutes
Part 2 - might last up to 20 minutes or longer depending on how engaging the open format discussions feel for attendees of the session

[2/3/23, 8:12:03 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, one recurring pattern I am been noticing since during the pandemic until now is that while both mega and small cap companies share prices tend to buoy during times of positive macro news, small cap companies tend not to keep their gains when the sentiment reverses while the big cap companies keep on hanging to theirs. 

This resulted in the price of mega caps spiraling out of control into the stratosphere while the small caps generally trading sideways when the federal reserve switches into expansionary monetary policy 

See how this chart shows this trend perfectly over a 5 year horizon?

https://truesight.me/compare/DAL,META,NCLH,NFLX,NYMT,AAPL/2023-02-03/1800

This leads me to the two following hypothesis

1) maybe small caps are more suitable for very short term swing trading (a few days to a few weeks holding period) since their denominator doesn’t really change much

2) mega caps are more suitable for holding for prolonged periods of time (months to a year or two), basically for an entire duration of a central banks monetary policy regime

[2/3/23, 8:57:23 AM] Brian -IOM: First bitcoin runs, then flows into large cap alts, then mid cap alts. Lots of mid caps popping off above 200D moving average.
[2/3/23, 9:35:56 AM] Kelvin Chew: 📝 USA is afraid…. Of a balloon

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-spy-balloon-united-states-weather-3252711

Apparently the Chinese have never heard of google earth. Which can see more than one floating balloon. 

But it’s just an excuse to create justification and war sentiments for the upcoming war on China.

Which we are going to nuke them right Peter?
[2/3/23, 9:55:21 AM] Gary Teh: 2024? 🤔
[2/3/23, 9:57:26 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yup. For elections
[2/3/23, 9:57:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Rally the people against one common enemy
[2/3/23, 10:03:44 AM] Gary Teh: Which side do you think would do the rallying? The republicans or the democrats? 

From my perspective it’s enlightening to gain exposure to the prevalent narratives on various sides. It helps open up a full spectrum visibility to the pieces on the chessboard that are otherwise not considered if the lay of the land was just examined with just a restricted set of lens 

this recurring surfaced during conversation with a few folks while I was davos. 

It’s healthy to focus the attention to develop a positive mindset (the Yang) and it is insightful to study in the detail all the information that might be labeled as negative or come across as psychologically disturbing (the yin)
‎[2/3/23, 10:06:49 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/3/23, 10:13:19 AM] Kelvin Chew: Democrats I think
[2/3/23, 10:17:41 AM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense. Fromy perspective, the republicans have been tending towards the isolationist stance ever since the previous president’s term 

In fact that seems to be the prevailing attitude when I was doing the overland survey in the middle parts of the US.
[2/3/23, 1:13:53 PM] Brian -IOM: I would support this hypothesis based on what I have heard and understood. I think it’s almost tidal in nature, and you can use Totals 1,2 & 3 in charting to study it. But very basically lower-cap alts experience greater volatility and often in predictable cycles, following a bitcoin pump, as money diversifies out and increases its appetite for risk. So a perfect strategy would be to catch the waves in the ebb and flow, to advance and retreat. To be like water my friend. 😉
[2/3/23, 1:21:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Anyway. It’s so easy to destroy the balloon. The government just watched it float in for weeks and did nothing then created this anti China story. It’s intentional. 

I mean they could have easily just sent Jerome Powell. If anyone can burst a bubble it’s him. Lol
[2/3/23, 1:35:10 PM] Brian -IOM: @14153000019 total 3 is market cap excluding BTC and ETH

[2/4/23, 3:57:15 AM] Gary Teh: Made some pretty interesting progress over the past few hours after chatting with @918017107841 when we unexpectedly chatted about EcoVerse21 after shifting our attention away from Cypher Defense (road blocked in that department at the moment still) 

Didn’t realize she is in fact a subject matter expert when it comes to international commodity trade 

Feels like we might have a bingo moment. Now that we have sources for coffee supplies thanks to @254729080961 and the list of potential purchasing agents thanks to @918017107841 we can now start experimenting on figuring out how to incentivize in a decentralized manner all the activities involved in moving coffee from point A to point B through tokenization of such actions in our rubric.

This network based infinitely inductive social experiment (game as @41791555798 and Geunther would like to call it) continues to surprise🤩

[2/4/23, 8:12:05 AM] Gary Teh: First hand information over coffee 🙂
[2/4/23, 8:28:51 AM] Gary Teh: I am actually starting to think this morning, as similar to all the prediction market activities and discussions shifting over to OffChain ecosystem that @14152032783 and @8618926086648 are nurturing, all the esoteric and spirituality related discussions might make more sense being shifted over to the house of balance ecosystem that @13104674556 Tiff and Hans Martin are nurturing 

Folks who are keen to dive deeper into esoteric and spirituality related discussions please to do let me know and I will direct as such 

Seems like the TrueSight DAO ecosystem is slowly gravitating back to its origins of surfacing impactful nascent trends and projects which are information arbitrage-like in nature as these other thematic discussions start flowing to vortex most suited for them. 🤔

[2/4/23, 8:32:18 AM] Jonathan: They mention stock forecasting and sports
[2/4/23, 8:33:27 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! He is the colleague of one of our board members in the previous company 

I remember one of my team mates left to join an early stage startup that he funded 

He is very very deep in the network effects/market place investing space
[2/4/23, 8:33:53 AM] Jonathan: It’s pretty good in general so may be worth a listen to the whole thing
[2/4/23, 8:35:03 AM] Jonathan: He also mentioned something similar to what we talked about in terms of matching people on LinkedIn
[2/4/23, 8:35:48 AM] Gary Teh: What about it? 🙂
[2/4/23, 8:37:18 AM] Jonathan: It was also a very short. I need to listen again but he seemed to be similar
[2/4/23, 8:39:36 AM] Gary Teh: Not surprised. A lot of the earlier stage investors that were sitting on Edmodo’s board were specialized in network effects and market place investing 

the chairman himself, who provided the seed funding, was the cofounder of LinkedIn.
[2/4/23, 8:40:03 AM] Jonathan: Nice
[2/4/23, 8:43:31 AM] Gary Teh: A few of the DAO members were early employees of LinkedIn and Google.

I guess network naturally taps on existing networks and grows of them. 

Putting aside the esoteric elements that were borrowed in the process of growing of this ecosystem, a lot of the principles were drawn from that network
[2/4/23, 8:46:11 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a lot of the really large tech startups in the Bay Area are really networks at their core 

Google, Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter…

If you take into account the crowd sourced training data for Tesla’s self driving car even that company too

That seems to be what Bay Area is specialized in
[2/4/23, 9:17:18 AM] Gary Teh: Great catching up @14152032783 just made the introduction to the folks who are working on the collaborative pitching concept via LinkedIn messaging 🙂🙏

[2/5/23, 5:35:50 AM] Anita Lamprecht: „The project/idea is a digital currency (not crypto, not blockchain) that allows communities to easily create and manage an alternative currency that can also be easily exchanged with other communities.  A big part of the idea is to reverse the wealth inequality that inevitably grows in any free-market exchange system“
[2/5/23, 5:36:19 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Sounds like an interesting project …
[2/5/23, 7:13:44 AM] Gary Teh: What synchronicity, was sharing this phenomena of remonetization with Johnny yesterday when we were discussing about the logistics of burying the containers in the desert. 

Actually briefly recalled surfacing the underlying issue (of prevalent mispricing) the other day on the chat too 

This two phenomenas of remonetization and social mining (that @972556609556 @41762654166 @4915209984105 and @491736386942 are working on) is Starting to remind me of the period in 2012 when there are suddenly massive numbers of new startups focusing on webscraping business models sprouting up because the viability of that technology frontier just open up. 🤔
[2/5/23, 7:19:48 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Maybe it’s worth connecting with the inventor of second life 🤷🏼‍♀️..
[2/5/23, 7:20:01 AM] Gary Teh: Might make sense 🤩

[2/5/23, 7:15:54 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has kindly offered to help do up a landing page that introduces our DAO as well as the various we are supporting in our ecosystem

She needs help with someone who is good with drafting up content for the landing page she plans to create 

🙂🙏
[2/5/23, 7:17:11 PM] Gary Teh: Seems @19514467219 and @5511982667030 have both expressed the need for such a landing page too 🤔

I guess at some point maybe this landing page will manifest 🤣
[2/5/23, 9:53:11 PM] Anupa/diya: Stage 1: revamped with projects listed, purpose, intent, outcome onboarding steps and registration 
(Maybe the ability the switch between projects) and some other features 

Stage 2: customized member profiles with info and allocation and use of the tokens
‎[2/6/23, 3:10:19 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/6/23, 3:40:38 AM] Gary Teh: One recurring pattern i am starting to notice within our DAO, the nomads and the house of balance is that a dungeons and dragons like “tavern” will tend to form after a while where folks just randomly pop in to chat about whatever. 

That is where they usually discover and find out about projects in the community that they might be keen to participate in or meet people whom they might find interesting to continue the conversations with somewhere else

In our case it’s this chatroom, in the case of the house of balance it’s their main community chatroom and in the case of the nomads is usually center camp ( or if they are planning to get high as well the dab squad camp) 

The projects within the communities takes place in a separate chatrooms that keen members would be able to easily get directions from.
[2/6/23, 4:45:19 AM] Gary Teh: Amazing to notice this insight only surfacing today on public media 

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-stocks-tesla-exact-sciences-cathie-wood-2023-2

It should have been apparent years ago. 

Access to proprietary dataset is what gives an AI model an edge over another which have exactly the same build. 

The other source of edge is the mental model of experts that were consulted to figure out the parameters when defining the model 🤔

[2/6/23, 5:52:30 AM] Gary Teh: What synchronicity! 🤩

@436608133615 just shared this. I first came across a variant of this prototype at the church of enlightenment here in slab city 

Will experiment with utilizing this in our Sun mint project 🤩
[2/6/23, 5:53:56 AM] Brian -IOM: These magnetic devices have been around for years and have allegedly been scaled - but they never seem to reach the market. 🧐
[2/6/23, 5:55:00 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : I hope this helps in any way, tesla experimented a lot with this stuff. He had more than 100+ patents on creating energy. Your idea is mindblowing, i wish you maximum success ⚡💡
[2/6/23, 5:55:05 AM] Gary Teh: Well they don’t need to. They only need to reach the off grid colonies that we are planning to create across the entire desert belt 🤩
[2/6/23, 5:56:06 AM] Brian -IOM: H2O can also be transformed into HHO
[2/6/23, 5:56:59 AM] Brian -IOM: That's the way to do it 🙌
[2/6/23, 5:57:16 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Do you have documents to share on that?
[2/6/23, 5:59:56 AM] Brian -IOM: Yes - give me 24hrs, I'm off to London this pm.
[2/6/23, 2:04:35 PM] Gary Teh: The battle of David versus Goliath begins

My sense tells me Google might end up winning out. Main reason is because they could give it away for free (subsidized via Ads revenue) whilst OpenAI needs to charge subscription
[2/6/23, 2:25:38 PM] Gary Teh: Now that funding has basically dried up traditional startup models that rely heavily on easy access to Fiat capital probably wouldn’t work as well 

https://trib.al/R4tFx7Z?fbclid=IwAR3vQ-4hjKYTgBdu1Qyr1jw8DEtAvoFM3irh4VrlsTVcak8h8qszTl9qtXo

My hunch tells me we should be expecting to see more and more of such decentralized funding models based on direct resource injection as opposed to indirect routes via fiat

[2/8/23, 4:51:29 PM] Gary Teh: What are your project needs?
[2/8/23, 4:57:41 PM] Gary Teh: Do you also have more details like the deck listing the use cases you are going after, the tech stack you are looking at as well as the tokenomics you have in mind 

Chatting with Pascal who is leading the neutral AI initiative for the city of Davos this Friday 

Will help explore synergy between these two projects
[2/8/23, 4:57:43 PM] Peter Peng: Right now we need to collect wallet addresses that want to participate in our pre-sale
[2/8/23, 5:01:14 PM] Gary Teh: Which chain?
[2/8/23, 5:01:56 PM] Peter Peng: There will be 21 million “Genesis Tokens” at 0.00001 ETH ($0.017 ~ a penny) per token $GTP
[2/8/23, 5:02:09 PM] Peter Peng: This is for early insiders
[2/8/23, 5:02:29 PM] Peter Peng: Ethereum
[2/8/23, 5:02:58 PM] Gary Teh: Also do you have a roadmap?
[2/8/23, 5:03:38 PM] Peter Peng: After Phase 1 Genesis we will conduct a public sale 68 million tokens
[2/8/23, 5:03:57 PM] Peter Peng: Working on that now
[2/8/23, 5:04:39 PM] Peter Peng: It’s basically ChatGTP for Web3

[2/8/23, 5:13:03 PM] Peter Peng: Im trying to figure out if I should bring it underneath JETSON X
[2/8/23, 5:13:24 PM] Peter Peng: But right now it’s just me
[2/8/23, 5:14:12 PM] Peter Peng: It doesn’t fit underneath JETSON X’s investment thesis so I might roll it out with a DAO
[2/8/23, 5:15:32 PM] Peter Peng: Or a few DAOs
[2/8/23, 5:23:24 PM] Gary Teh: Actually might make sense to fit it under JETSON X since that is basically AI focused anyways 🙂
[2/8/23, 5:23:53 PM] Peter Peng: Let’s see
[2/8/23, 5:24:17 PM] Peter Peng: I guess it still has real world utility
[2/8/23, 5:24:41 PM] Peter Peng: I just changed it to any wallet

[2/8/23, 10:48:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: Actually Gary.
[2/8/23, 10:48:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: I would say. Google’s upward momentum is declining rapidly and it is signalling a momentum trend change
[2/8/23, 10:49:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: However since it is still above the 0 line which I marked with the cyan arrow pointing to the dotted line. 

Is still a positive momentum.
[2/8/23, 10:51:35 PM] Kelvin Chew: The algo is predicting the momentum to reduce to below 0 or turn negative only by tonight
‎[2/8/23, 10:53:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: ‎image omitted
[2/8/23, 10:54:47 PM] Kelvin Chew: Looking at the weekly chart however. Google 10MA yellow line is projected to turn sharply up next week. And the confluence of MAs will present a strong support at $96.03 which is also the extreme for my calculated grid. 

Any price below 96.03 is a buy
[2/9/23, 4:17:11 AM] Gary Teh: I am wondering if some macro news is going to surface next and trigger the whole negative momentum in the market next
[2/9/23, 5:30:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: U mean positive.
[2/9/23, 5:34:44 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. I mean negative. Or has something negative already surfaced on your radar? The only ones that I am aware of that are of much impact are the interest rates and the US China tension

What I observe is the indicators signal a potential trends change first and then news happens before the trends really gain momentum and an overall trend reversion finally happens. 

It’s like the “insiders” place their positions first before news is being used to manipulate the masses for them to lock in their gains and then exit their positions fully

[2/9/23, 6:00:51 AM] Gary Teh: Been playing around with Microsoft’s ChatGpt implementation 

Doesn’t seem that very impressive. Its just another widget on their search results page 🤔

examining the full stack when it comes to both companies search business Microsoft and Google, here is what I am seeing

Both have large scale crawlers 
Both are reliant on Ad revenues
Both have enterprise suits 
Both have cloud service solutions 

For both companies to fully transition to AI conversation based chat for their search experience, they will end up cannibalizing their Ads business model. I doubt they would actually go about that. And I doubt publishers who have indexed their site against these search engines would welcome that. That would open a space for a new competitor to come in (duck duck go?) Publishers would end up indexing their sites against this new competitors if these two behemoths committed the mistake of moving away from the king of the hill positions they are currently occupying 

Plus it’s not really a great user experience. As a human I will still want to see the source and go down the rabbit hole myself. Rabbit holing is a very human behavior that will never go away. Having an AI chat bot to be the “be all end all” experience is basically a very faulty assumption of human behavior. It’s taking away the autonomy of human beings and humans will naturally revolt against that 

What might end up happening instead is their both companies start deploying these AI models to enhance the user experience across their entire product suit. However they have already been doing that for the longest time. So this is not new news 

When I dug even deeper into ChatGpt for deeper explorations of certain subjects I have challenges getting any deeper more insightful response than the usual superficial ones 

This might be a good question to pose to ChatGpt. How will Microsoft out compete google in the search business? 🤔
[2/9/23, 6:01:19 AM] Tres Garcia: I agree ☝️ “market go up 90%” of the time. I’m just greedy and want to make sure I preserve capital on the rapid falls down! 😂🤣😂

[2/9/23, 11:04:34 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking with the CEO of Alitheum today (whom was introduced during Davos)

Seems they have managed to figures out the initial marketing channel (via PR marketing) for their yet to be solution against fake news (which is exactly what Edgar is doing for us)

The goal of the session today is to figure out how we could invest Edgar into their project to form the center piece and for our DAO to own a piece of their company in the exchange

That way we could free up our resources to do something else while Edgar finally gets some much needed marketing power via this joint venture
[2/9/23, 11:05:14 AM] Gary Teh: Worse case scenario nothing comes out of this and we continue getting signals from Edgar on what to watch out for in the markets as fake news surface and distort market prices

[2/9/23, 11:52:49 AM] Gary Teh: This bifurcation patterns seems to be a recurring one both in our network as well as in the house of balance
[2/9/23, 11:53:24 AM] Satheesh Paddolker: This is noted
[2/9/23, 12:23:43 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished the chat with the team from Alitheum. 

Next steps in chronological order
- create a whatsapp chatroom I will be in it with them
- we share the link to our site truesight.me
- they share their product roadmap
- we identify the gaps between what is already there in Edgar and where they are planning to go with their roadmap
- we bring in the engineering leads
- we establish a valuation for Edgar and submit it. for voting amongst our governors
- we do an exchange
- The engineering lead gets selected to for follow on development to fill up the product gaps
[2/9/23, 12:25:16 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/9/23, 12:25:32 PM] Gary Teh: Most likely it will end up being a source code fork off the main branch on GitHub.
[2/9/23, 12:45:36 PM] Gary Teh: This year it seems will be super interesting if there arrangements go through our DAO will end up holding equity in startups as well as owning land in the desert. 🤩
[2/9/23, 1:25:00 PM] Gary Teh: @14075792560 I will be having a conference call with the director who is leading the neutral AI network project supported by the city of Davos tomorrow 

https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/a--neutral--hub-for-artificial-intelligence-in-the-swiss-alps/48246640

Depending on how the talk goes as well as if there is a fit, let’s see if I could bring you in 

I have already sounded that project out to Vibhu. He mentioned he will take a look next week. He is right now partying in India 🤣
[2/9/23, 1:26:55 PM] Peter Peng: Sounds like fun, I want to go to GOA
[2/9/23, 1:29:47 PM] Peter Peng: Looking to bring on good advisors
[2/9/23, 2:08:06 PM] Gary Teh: Actually what would be really interesting would be to short Microsoft (if put calls are not already too expensive) at this point. 

The assumption underlying this is that the media hype will soon wear and the prices will once again revert back to mean when the crowd recover their senses 🤔
[2/9/23, 2:22:44 PM] Brian -IOM: That’s what I said! 😎
[2/9/23, 2:23:15 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Makes sense
[2/9/23, 2:27:02 PM] Brian -IOM: You’d have to be pretty sure to take both sides of the bet simultaneously 😊

[2/9/23, 7:52:24 PM] Gary Teh: @14152032783 had a great chat with Tomas just now. Seems the same theme of social mining that we have been chatting between @972556609556 @41762654166 @491736386942 and @4915209984105 surfaced again 

I wonder if there might be synergy to be had 

There are a lot of web3 project leaders in the OffChain community 

A possible utility to test would be for these web3 project leaders to hire decentralized mechanical Turk to do QA testing for their  app. 

Untested smart contracts released into production environments is disasterous

The way to quickly test this utility is to surface and get a sense how many web3 project leaders in OffChain will be keen to pay fiat or their own tokens to access this service 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 7:55:48 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks Gary! Tell me more about the mechanical Turk concept. That’s interesting
[2/9/23, 7:57:55 PM] Gary Teh: Right now Qa engineers write script to test their app. Problem is it only captures a small subset of the bugs

The apps themselves still need manual testing 

The assumption is If product owners have a cheap way to get manual testing done, they would do so

Do follow up with Tomas to chat about it 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 7:59:26 PM] Peter Peng: I’m thinking my project will need help @14153000019
[2/9/23, 7:59:36 PM] Peter Peng: In all areas
[2/9/23, 8:02:30 PM] Gary Teh: You need to define the human resource slots. If not then at least the set of actions you need performed in your ecosystem 

@6594897484 made a really good movie recommendation which I finally got to watch on the plane the other day. Oceans 11

George colony and brad Pitt literally spent a few weeks defining the roles they need for their project and then went about recruiting those roles. 

Their team literally consisted 11 morels in that movie, hence it’s called Ocean’s 11. Danny Ocean’s (George Colony) crew of 11
[2/9/23, 8:04:08 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that Alessandro and me were chatting about using the decentralized model to crowd source data from startups to train an AI model that could be used to access social impact focused companies who want to raise funding

The real world needs and use case is clearly defined

You have defined a general technology direction you want to go with the AI platform. What is missing right now is the human need is not very clear
[2/9/23, 8:05:33 PM] Peter Peng: Thanks I need to pull together a leadership team
[2/9/23, 8:06:30 PM] Gary Teh: But first focus on discovering a real world need you want to fulfill with your AI stAck

Then figure who you need to pull into your leadership team 

The problem dictates the profiles and the profiles define the solution
‎[2/9/23, 8:07:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:08:11 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I think I’ll need a mix of people with AI experience and Web3 experience
‎[2/9/23, 8:25:25 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:29:35 PM] Gary Teh: Actually if you submitted it as a project in the governors channel for approval to include in our ecosystem I am sure governors will have it approved and we can then start figuring out which tokenizable actions we should within our DAO 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:30:46 PM] Peter Peng: Can we make governors as part of leadership team?
[2/9/23, 8:30:59 PM] Peter Peng: Well ones that want to participate
[2/9/23, 8:31:28 PM] Peter Peng: I would think that this project would be good for this DAO
[2/9/23, 8:32:35 PM] Gary Teh: Just propose this in the governors channel 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:33:37 PM] Gary Teh: That is aligned with one of our three core values 

Autonomy 

The rest being Integrity and diversity 

Exercise your own autonomy in this space

Always act with integrity 

Always respect diversity 

🙂🙏
‎[2/9/23, 8:34:39 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:35:54 PM] Gary Teh: You are own of the governors by the way, so surfacing projects to be voted for inclusion in our space is one of your privileges 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 8:38:18 PM] Peter Peng: Do you think the project should have its own DAO?
[2/9/23, 8:38:45 PM] Peter Peng: But also commingles with this DAO?
[2/9/23, 8:39:01 PM] Gary Teh: I would think of it more as an operations committee like how the other projects are structured
[2/9/23, 8:40:04 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha, but I can get real $ investments for this project
‎[2/9/23, 8:40:13 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/9/23, 8:41:34 PM] Gary Teh: As with the way sun mint is potentially going to be structured different tier for folks who bring in Fiat 

In traditional terms a different class of shares
[2/9/23, 8:42:04 PM] Gary Teh: Just need to make sure the tiering is well balanced
[2/9/23, 8:42:36 PM] Peter Peng: Okay let me think on it
[2/9/23, 8:43:49 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure the folks who bring in fiat wants to have some form of accountability and maybe control over funds deployment 

Last thing they want is to be suckered into a pump and dump scheme

So having accountability in terms of funds deployment wi be key
[2/9/23, 8:44:24 PM] Peter Peng: I may just bring it under JetsonX if I build in plans to vertically integrate it into hospitality
[2/9/23, 8:44:48 PM] Gary Teh: Up to you. It’s your autonomy you are exercising 🙂👍
[2/9/23, 8:45:13 PM] Gary Teh: Let us know what you eventually decide
[2/9/23, 8:45:21 PM] Peter Peng: I can bring in big $ into the project this way
[2/9/23, 8:46:09 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, funding is of secondary importance 

The more important thing is the actual market adoption of what will get built
[2/9/23, 8:46:55 PM] Peter Peng: Well I need funding to pay for the servers and hire more engineers
[2/9/23, 8:47:01 PM] Peter Peng: I’m at that point
[2/9/23, 8:47:43 PM] Peter Peng: Pre-sale (Phase 1) will allow for this to happen
[2/9/23, 8:48:03 PM] Gary Teh: Premature scaling will probably kill the project really fast 🤔
[2/9/23, 8:48:41 PM] Gary Teh: Do spend time to figure the use case you are targeting
[2/9/23, 8:49:02 PM] Peter Peng: The pre-sale is capped at a certain amount of tokens
[2/9/23, 8:49:27 PM] Peter Peng: Then it moves into another phase
[2/9/23, 8:50:11 PM] Peter Peng: Kind of like different rounds (funds are allocated in different areas)
[2/9/23, 8:51:24 PM] Gary Teh: Do really spend time to figure out the primary use case and core utility is

I see so many web3 projects that raised funds and then immediately crash and burn because the projects leaders fail to consider this key aspects
[2/9/23, 8:51:48 PM] Peter Peng: I believe hospitality (restaurants, hotels, travel) is a good starting point
[2/9/23, 8:52:33 PM] Peter Peng: I’m already plugged into this industry
[2/9/23, 8:53:09 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Would be helpful if you can frame clearly an existing problem that AI could be used to solve
[2/9/23, 8:53:41 PM] Peter Peng: The corporations can buy these coins to train our system
[2/9/23, 8:53:55 PM] Gary Teh: Given your existing network, my sense is it shouldn’t be that hard to identify a good problem to solve
[2/9/23, 8:54:19 PM] Peter Peng: I just want to be able to ask it questions
[2/9/23, 8:54:56 PM] Gary Teh: Will need to identify a pain point these corporations want to solve 

Only then does it makes sense to consider tokenization
[2/9/23, 8:55:05 PM] Peter Peng: What steakhouse in NYC serves Opus One wine?
[2/9/23, 8:55:29 PM] Peter Peng: Today, ChapGPT not Google can get that granular
[2/9/23, 8:55:43 PM] Peter Peng: *ChatGPT not Google
[2/9/23, 8:56:09 PM] Peter Peng: Discoverability
[2/9/23, 8:56:47 PM] Peter Peng: They will buy $GPT to train their data into the system
[2/9/23, 8:57:41 PM] Peter Peng: And customers will have $GPT to make searches (micro transactions)
[2/9/23, 8:58:01 PM] Peter Peng: Instead of paying SaaS
[2/9/23, 8:59:52 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like these are two human behaviors statements you can quickly test amongst your network within the industry before even building out the system 🙂
[2/9/23, 9:00:34 PM] Gary Teh: Basically hypothesis that need to be true before you model can work
[2/9/23, 9:01:23 PM] Gary Teh: If you are able to validate these two behaviors to be true, I am sure fundraising will not even be an issue
[2/9/23, 9:02:01 PM] Peter Peng: Well they are looking to me to create the tech for the industry, I was unsure if I should bring this general purpose tech underneath the platform
[2/9/23, 9:03:16 PM] Gary Teh: Based on my experience People don’t like to think too much 

Just keep the experience dumb and stupid 🤣
[2/9/23, 9:03:30 PM] Peter Peng: But I think it’s a good starting point for commercialization
[2/9/23, 9:04:37 PM] Peter Peng: *I’ll have to release it with disclaimer
[2/9/23, 9:06:15 PM] Garis Pang: Once BTC be able to breached the 21349 Level, it will be a continuation of a major downward trend 📉
[2/9/23, 9:06:53 PM] Peter Peng: BTC is only going up
[2/9/23, 9:07:42 PM] Garis Pang: Ya after it finished off the major downward trend first 👎
[2/9/23, 9:11:39 PM] Gary Teh: By the way quick update on the EcoVerse21 project, now that the committee has horned in on coffee beans as the commodity we want to focus on, things are really gaining velocity 

@918017107841 is a real trooper leading the charge 🤩
[2/9/23, 9:14:39 PM] Peter Peng: @14153000019 I think I’ll create a GPT wallet that has our GPT protocol inside it
[2/9/23, 9:15:00 PM] Peter Peng: So people can use it inside the wallet
[2/9/23, 9:20:41 PM] Peter Peng: And then use the mobile wallet to also pay for things
[2/9/23, 9:26:19 PM] Peter Peng: Like “Google it” we can coin the phrase “ask GPT”
[2/9/23, 9:27:33 PM] Peter Peng: It will be Web3’s search 🔍
[2/9/23, 9:28:13 PM] Peter Peng: The goal is to build an AI economy

Those that have survived till now that are still doggedly working on web3 projects right now still are really the hardcore ones 

The folks who were just in the space because of the hype have all left by now
[2/9/23, 10:08:50 PM] Peter Peng: I’ve always been in it for the technology
[2/9/23, 10:08:53 PM] Gary Teh: This shakeout has overall been healthy for the ecosystem
[2/9/23, 10:10:50 PM] Peter Peng: I’m happy about it, it shows who have been building the whole time and who the most talented and hardworking is. I stick to Silicon Valley’s startup culture.

[2/10/23, 5:42:04 AM] Tres Garcia: As for the market & chat GPT
The model only has data from 2021, so their dataset is incomplete. 
The Jan market was on a tear, so it only makes sense that people take profit. 
I see the market going sideways & choppy until the fed lowers rates.

[2/11/23, 3:41:48 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 @5491125130580 is working on a game and is looking for utility 

Thought it might be useful to link up the both of you since you are operating a gaming launchpad
[2/11/23, 6:05:35 PM] Gary Teh: Had a wonderful coffee session with @5491125130580 just now where he suggested that we take a portion of the 5000USDT in our treasury and allow DAO members to control which publicly traded company stock symbols it gets deployed via a trading account through voting. 

The way it works is that members can surface stock tickers they find to be undervalued for a trade execution and other members in the community can either vote to execute on the proposed trade or skip it. 

A majority decision results in the capital in the trading account being fully deployed to that position via existing API integration that Edgar already has to Ameritrade or Coinbase. 

Edgar automatically exits the position once profit targets of 3 standard deviation is achieved

Since the current liquidation value (in traditional finance terms net book value per share) of our governance tokens are backed by the USDT balance we have in our treasury. 

This collective action will result in either the appreciation or depreciation of our governance tokens’ liquidation value

Seems like a great idea. Submitting it to the governors for voting. If it passes, makes sense to implement it when I get back from Antarctica later this month 🙂
[2/11/23, 6:06:51 PM] Peter Peng: Sounds like a great idea to build value
[2/11/23, 6:09:26 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it also makes a lot of sense since there are quite a few members in our community who have professional finance background
[2/11/23, 6:14:01 PM] Gary Teh: It might also start making sense for us to start listing the official liquidation value of our governance tokens on our landing page since we technically have access to the values programmatically be they 

1 - in our vault 
2 - in our trading account
3 - on the decentralized exchange (coming soon)

We will definitely need to get item 3 sorted out before Sun Mint comes online. That way members who wants to off ramp their governance tokens to help off set some in real life expenses can easily do so
[2/11/23, 6:16:16 PM] Gary Teh: As @5491125130580 rightfully suggested, Sun Mint will end up being the dynamo that powers all the other projects in our ecosystem that have some form of tokenomics associated with our governance tokens
[2/11/23, 6:35:26 PM] Gary Teh: Another highly impactful suggestion @5491125130580 made was to allow the entire community to control issuing governance tokens from our vault for airdrops in lieu of contributions made that are recorded on our ledger 

This helps us get around the current problem of rotating governors in and out of the vault management solutions we are currently examining 

If this rule comes to pass the role of governors would be reduced to

- editing rights to our rubric 
- editing rights to our ledger 
- rights to surface and vote on inclusion and exclusion of spaces/projects in our ecosystem

To keep things simple I am seeing each token holder to have voting right of 1 when it comes to governance token issues

Surfacing this for voting amongst the governors too

https://bondee.net/main??

A member of our DaO is looking to reach them. Based on historical patterns. Seems receiving a surprised huge injection of funds might be in store for them 🤔
[2/12/23, 4:36:03 AM] Peter Peng: If you can use the profits to create a liquidity pool that would be even better
[2/12/23, 4:37:10 AM] Peter Peng: For Solana I believe you can you Serum for this but they are suggesting a minimum $10k
[2/12/23, 4:44:43 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. That is the plan 

To create a liquidity pool on Raydium which utilizes the serum protocol for our governance tokens liquidity pool

From what I observe now we are still USD5K short to create the liquidity pool
[2/12/23, 4:46:55 AM] Gary Teh: Assuming either sun mint or our collective open market trading activities go as planned (which things never really do given the chaotic environment) the profits will be utilized to create the liquidity pool. 

Future profits generated via the import/export transactions going through EcoVerse21 will also be used to populate our liquidity pool
[2/12/23, 4:48:21 AM] Gary Teh: If my hunch is right about the use case the Alessandro is mentioning about AI based pitch book model is true. 

The profits from those will also be utilized to populate out liquidity pool

[2/12/23, 8:35:45 AM] Gary Teh: Bulk of the visitors are pensioners so unless their countries go bankrupt, it does not seem like their pension will get disrupted. 

Given the generally fixed and unchanging preferences of this demographic, It almost feels like this company is being kept alive by regular but indirect injection of government money. 

I doubt any of these folks would acquire a new hobby of skydiving anytime soon  

Oil price is definitely going to eat into their profit margin until the Russian embargo gets sorted out. Short to mid term headwinds 

Labor is mainly from Philippines (cheap labor)

Older folks don’t eat as much.

Last I overheard from a nomad who independently reviewed this company versus the other two larger competitors, it does not force passengers into any specific programs. The free and easy is the differentiation edge. 

Debt load versus its revenue is the concern. Likely not be an issue if the crowd really does rebound to pre-pandemic levels if it hadn’t already done so 🤔
[2/12/23, 8:37:22 AM] Gary Teh: Given a lot of baby boomers are hitting retirement age this decades I wonder how many percent of these new retirees will acquire this new hobby of cruises 

If it is significant then we should be expecting market size to generally increase (until they start dying off)
[2/12/23, 8:45:10 AM] Tres Garcia: What kind of animal is that?! For a moment I thought it was cosplay
[2/12/23, 8:54:48 AM] Tres Garcia: Sorry to stereotype: but that’s exactly how I imagined the demographics of the passengers on an Arctic or South Pole cruise.

[2/13/23, 4:30:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: More warmongering. What rubbish that China is the one who is starting a Cold War when the Americans is the one that starts it. 

Who started throwing them with tariffs at them?

Who started to blockade semi conductor chips against them?

Who sent battleships halfway around the world to sail at the very doorsteps of their country? 

Who started the media smear  articles constantly over the years against them. 

Who declared a competition against them when China constantly asked for corporation. 

Who instigated riots in hongkong which is a China state. 

Who involved themselves in a “domestic” war between China and Taiwan which on one hand the world acknowledges the one China policy, but the next moment outright sends weapons to Taiwan who according to the one China policy they acknowledged is part of China itself. 

The hypocrisy is baffling. And they say that China is the one starting a cold war. 

Well. Media readers across the world are not stupid. At least not for people in Singapore (an allied American country. Not China)   

We know this is standard American suppression tactics.

[2/13/23, 5:00:49 PM] Kelvin Chew: If they created communism. And it works for their country. It’s their freedom isn’t it? So long as they don’t impose their communism against us. It’s the freedom of policy in their nation.
[2/13/23, 5:01:32 PM] Peter Peng: Right, but they kept trying to spread it
[2/13/23, 5:03:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: That I am against. But I just disagree with this communism thing. If a country has communism. Let the people deal with it. Or leave their own country. Another country shouldn’t involve themselves with another country’s culture and freedom and traditions. 

Otherwise they are just a busybody.
[2/13/23, 5:04:14 PM] Peter Peng: I agree, unless their is oppressive and there is enough data to suggest that intervention is needed

[2/13/23, 5:10:50 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then u are part of the theology that God is not all good nor all evil. God is God and is neutral. 

I don’t really agree with that. But I have heard of that debate.
[2/13/23, 5:13:44 PM] Peter Peng: Good and evil is based on perspective
[2/13/23, 5:14:10 PM] Peter Peng: God is just the highest power

[2/13/23, 5:19:14 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just making an observation based on my own personal experience, but that could be different for others.. but I’m glad that you can relate to it even though we have different viewpoints politically
[2/13/23, 5:29:15 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe as humanity right now is setting up the bases for the laws of AI, that can help us to create better laws for us, for some elemental and basic interactions and behaviors, where we can at least grow from there, even maybe unite... pretty optimistic, sorry. Even smart contracts are creating a different mindset to achieve that.
[2/13/23, 5:30:10 PM] Peter Peng: I agree 100%
[2/13/23, 6:15:09 PM] Marvin: China has been an awful partner, they banned a number of foreign imports, American social networks, stole an enormous amount of western technology forcing western companies into joint venture for market access. Most people in Hong Kong and Taiwan want to keep their independence, a fact that China likes to ignore. What smear campaigns? You mean news reports in all countries where journalists don’t get arrested when they write articles?
[2/13/23, 6:15:54 PM] Marvin: China has not been a reliable partner, I hope Europe and the US shift their focus towards India and other more democratic nations as partners

The Actor had signed tons of debts deal created by the US’s Military Complex, which can’t be repaid in due time. Big stakes are in for possible repossession of lands in return to repay the debts incurred by Ukraine for the Jews to move in even if the lands are still there for them. Purely my own assumption.

Love the lack of LT strategic vision. Spot on…. But “Why?”

Why does the US Military lack a significant Long term strategic vision: 

1. Nothing to do with Israel’s secret cabal
2. Everything to with US election cycles (4years) and
3. Annual military/ US budget spending. 
4. Congress & The Sed def are always trying to predict the next war and not how to fight the last war. (See Iraq 2003-Present) they were geared for Iraq 1994, but got an insurgency. 
5. Now back to the table to ask for more money, and stay in office. 

Vs China with a 50 year plan held by the people in power that will stay in power until the day they die. No need to change strategies mid term.

It might start making sense to track the headlines published on the landing pages of these domains and then award members governance tokens for discovering these new sources. This is because more of these sources will help Edgar become even more calibrated when discovering and surfacing new impactful trends for portfolio management purposes 

Surfacing this for voting amongst the governors 🙂👍

[2/15/23, 7:50:10 AM] Peter Peng: I kicked one guy out for sharing a SHIB mining link 😂
[2/15/23, 7:50:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: 1) knowledge (which Edgar presents)

2) timing (which my custom indicators does)

3) experience (which everyone is constantly learning and evolving)

4) luck (this is the place of interest)
[2/15/23, 7:52:51 AM] Kelvin Chew: I recently had the opportunity to learn from a school that uses i-ching/5elements/numerology and fengshui combined and use it to calculate moments of higher energy states (or luck) do execute more risky trades. Lol
[2/15/23, 7:53:04 AM] Kelvin Chew: Maybe it’s coincidence but so far it’s working. LOL
[2/15/23, 7:53:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: Just thought u might find it interesting since I know u are into this form of traditional culture
[2/15/23, 7:56:52 AM] Kelvin Chew: I basically am starting to have too many people to handle in my chat group. So I split my people up into sub groups and I allocate “leaders” for each group. And even used numerology to split the groups. So that every team’s luck is synergised and compatible. LOL
[2/15/23, 8:13:32 AM] Gary Teh: Peter Gwee (Fengshui master) who was trying to get my help to rewrite his Fengshui software proposed the same 

Glad you have found use for it too. Been using it for my personal use as well. Since every person’s Bazi is different
[2/15/23, 8:14:02 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Makes a lot of sense. Was using that alittle in our group here as well as at the house of balance
[2/15/23, 8:21:05 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/15/23, 8:22:58 AM] Kelvin Chew: Slight difference though I am not just using fengshui. This school I went to. Combines 6 different types of methods which fengshui is one of the 6

[2/15/23, 9:04:14 PM] Jonathan: is there any service out there that allows you to take a photo and stamps the time and date on the blockchain immediately - so minting an NFT but not needing a wallet? pay with credit card.. a very small fee... for instance a picture at a board meeting to prove everyone was there.. ideally having some AI algorithm also investigate if the photo has been doctored. Just had a board meeting and I thought this would be an extra plus.
[2/15/23, 9:04:21 PM] Jonathan: might be demand for that.
[2/15/23, 9:06:36 PM] Jonathan: is there a way for a software to be sure that a photo was taken live? Maybe this service is out there. Just when you are thinking of listing your company later, it might be nice to show that the board meetings before really took place if it the cost is negligible.
[2/15/23, 9:07:16 PM] Jonathan: or at least very reasonable.
[2/15/23, 9:08:07 PM] Peter Peng: You would think, as I was writing my AI whitepaper today I’m starting to realize just how early we all are with Web3. It just seems like forever because I’ve been investing in crypto since 2017z
[2/15/23, 9:08:25 PM] Peter Peng: Everyone is building now
[2/15/23, 9:09:47 PM] Peter Peng: My instinct is that AI will save Crypto / blockchain / web3 because verification of data and digital trust will be a huge issue
[2/15/23, 9:16:55 PM] Jonathan: Might not be so hard to market this service if you go to the VCs and offer it with some other services to verify what the portfolio companies are doing.
[2/15/23, 9:18:08 PM] Peter Peng: Blockchain actually let’s the VC do a better job of keeping track of their portfolio companies
[2/15/23, 9:19:31 PM] Peter Peng: My thinking is that they could use a ChatGPT like system to get automated updates and reports

[2/16/23, 9:11:55 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGPT helped me write my whitepaper. Instead of banning it, schools should teach people how to utilize it. It’s not as easy as people make it out to be because you have to make it learn what you want.
[2/16/23, 9:13:06 PM] Peter Peng: For example, schools didn’t ban calculators… they invented Calculus.
[2/16/23, 9:14:08 PM] Peter Peng: ChatGPT is almost like an advanced literary calculator …

[2/16/23, 9:32:14 PM] Anupa/diya: I think it a great research tool in academia. I think schools just have to find the right use for the student and the school so the originality is maintained.

If the searches are all automated, I hope the answers don't turn into being generic. 

As a user, I would like to see how many people have used the same prompt to get the same answer or even maybe see the edited versions to the text.
[2/16/23, 9:33:28 PM] Peter Peng: Agree, or maybe generate responses trained on your personal writing style
[2/16/23, 9:33:46 PM] Peter Peng: Hyperpersonalized AI
[2/16/23, 9:35:30 PM] Peter Peng: I feel like for my whitepaper, the answers are original because I asked it very specific questions tailored to this topic
[2/16/23, 9:35:44 PM] Anupa/diya: I am wouldn't want to publish something which 50 other people have already used. Maybe it can be a paid version where the ai can be more bespoke. Like what grammarly does.
[2/16/23, 9:37:15 PM] Anupa/diya: If you could see if it has been published or used. Then it would add more value.
[2/16/23, 9:38:16 PM] Anupa/diya: This gives rise to the ai prompt writing community who can customize and even sell their work. Who knows.
[2/16/23, 9:38:17 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, I guess. It’s like someone taking Bitcoin’s whitepaper and reusing it lol

[2/17/23, 5:25:00 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of execution, you might want to remove the section on storing personal (training) data on the blockchain 

Been toying it around in my head for the past few months, that technical approach doesn’t scale very well.

You are forcing every single miner to keep petabytes of data in every instance 

From my perspective the more appropriate one would be something more similar to the bit torrent protocol where your data is stored on your local and is made available to AI trainers once the trainer agrees to a smart contract to exchange certain amount of governance tokens for the training data that is sitting on your local 

There are a few folks I was hoping to invite into the AI chatroom had the gating/quality assurance been better managed to discuss about this as well as some other issues I had in mind when implementing the decentralized AI now that I have had a better sensed attempting to decentralized the ownership and management of Edgar.

Namely:
——
The director leading the AI initiative 

Vibhu my former boss (who used to head RnD in Google) who is also starting to think along this direction 

The CIO of one of the London based in investment funds whom we discussed this topic very deeply while we were in davos
[2/17/23, 5:39:25 AM] Peter Peng: The data would be anonymized
[2/17/23, 5:40:16 AM] Peter Peng: I believe there would need to be a hybrid approach
[2/17/23, 5:44:00 AM] Peter Peng: I was discussing this with a blockchain group based out of Sweden yesterday
[2/17/23, 5:45:44 AM] Peter Peng: Either way this should all come at subsequent phases

[2/17/23, 6:42:46 AM] Gary Teh: Seems TrueSight.me is going to be down for a few days. 

My Credit card got hacked four months ago. Didn't receive any complain letters from Amazon about the payment not going through. I was assuming their service was really smart to auto resolve to the new credit card issued by my bank. Guess not. 

They suspended the AWS account used to run the data gathering services as well as the DNS services. 

Just updated the credit card associated with that AWS account. Their services should take a few days to restore. And then I will need to head in and restore the servers that were running in that account. 

We should expect a few days of missing data in our data set as we slowly get everything restored.

Meanwhile let's just all twiddle our thumb and do nothing! 🤣
[2/17/23, 6:46:26 AM] Gary Teh: Worse case scenario, I can start focusing on restoring servers on the 26th when I get back to Buenos Aires.

[2/17/23, 7:54:41 AM] Gary Teh: It does make a lot of sense to decentralized the underlying infrastructure otherwise despite all web3 claims of decentralization, all the underlying infrastructure is still held captive by AWS, google and Azure. 

This does make the whole decentralization argument of the web3 trend sound stupid

And AI (definitely the training portion and maybe the neural network portion ) being a very infrastructure heavy behemoth will really need to confront this infrastructure centralization issue head on.
[2/17/23, 8:07:05 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, but first Web3 needs to take marketshare from the big guys in the space. Then let’s other protocols emerge from it. Basically what Ethereum did to Bitcoin and others.
[2/17/23, 8:07:51 AM] Peter Peng: The other protocols can solve the solution off of the core tech
[2/17/23, 8:08:24 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the true nature of decentralization
[2/17/23, 8:08:31 AM] Gary Teh: Happy to have web3 take Edgar’s portion of market share away from big guys 

Tired of paying UsD 1000 plus per month to Jeff Bezos 🤣
[2/17/23, 8:09:27 AM] Peter Peng: Do you really need Edgar?
[2/17/23, 8:09:39 AM] Gary Teh: Yup.
[2/17/23, 8:09:47 AM] Peter Peng: Then maybe it’s worth it
[2/17/23, 8:10:08 AM] Gary Teh: Especially when it help us make so much money from the macro trades
[2/17/23, 8:10:29 AM] Peter Peng: If it makes you money then keep it
[2/17/23, 8:10:48 AM] Gary Teh: Happy if someone can come up with an infrastructure that we can pay them the USd1000 per month instead of Amazon
[2/17/23, 8:11:14 AM] Peter Peng: You should build it
[2/17/23, 8:11:24 AM] Peter Peng: Who built Edgar?
[2/17/23, 8:11:28 AM] Gary Teh: Too large an infrastructure
[2/17/23, 8:11:47 AM] Gary Teh: That would be me
[2/17/23, 8:12:25 AM] Peter Peng: If it pays for itself maybe keep it like that?
[2/17/23, 8:12:51 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/17/23, 8:13:08 AM] Gary Teh: Nope. That would be centralization once again
[2/17/23, 8:13:46 AM] Peter Peng: Does Edgar trade crypto?
[2/17/23, 8:14:09 AM] Gary Teh: I had engineering background in helping scale the platform of Edmodo from 10 million registered users to 100 million registered and then also on the growth hacking side which involved a lot of human psychology
[2/17/23, 8:14:14 AM] Gary Teh: Yes it does
[2/17/23, 8:14:42 AM] Gary Teh: It’s integrated into Coinbase api as well as Ametitrade API

[2/17/23, 8:16:24 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe you should do a token sale
[2/17/23, 8:16:37 AM] Peter Peng: And whitepaper
[2/17/23, 8:17:04 AM] Peter Peng: To see if people get on board
[2/17/23, 8:17:42 AM] Gary Teh: A lot of the trading thesis for these two asset classes were collaborative discovered by TrueSight DAo members 

Lot of these members either have background in technical analysis, fundamental analysis, quantitative trading, psychology or engineering
[2/17/23, 8:18:33 AM] Peter Peng: Then it should be easy
‎[2/17/23, 8:19:01 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/17/23, 8:19:48 AM] Gary Teh: Best to just decentralized the infrastructure and for folks who have use of it to contribute resources to run portions of it
[2/17/23, 8:20:38 AM] Peter Peng: Or find investors
[2/17/23, 8:21:33 AM] Peter Peng: If it’s a good idea someone will invest in it, just takes a lot of work. They also need to be a right fit.
[2/17/23, 8:23:06 AM] Peter Peng: Selling some sort of digital asset to fund it makes sense if you are a DAO
[2/17/23, 8:23:35 AM] Gary Teh: That introduces centralization

Just look at Wikipedia. That is a truly decentralized model. They just sustain their servers through donations
[2/17/23, 8:24:17 AM] Gary Teh: Happy to hear your proposal in that regard. I am sure the good ones will gain you more governance tokens in the DAO
[2/17/23, 8:25:09 AM] Peter Peng: I think you need a liquidity pool for the tokens
[2/17/23, 8:25:25 AM] Peter Peng: Or some larger plan
[2/17/23, 8:25:44 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t know
[2/17/23, 8:26:20 AM] Gary Teh: Liquidity pool makes a lot of sense. Still waiting for the governors to decide on the governance tokens vault management solution 

Voting on which liquidity pool pair to setup is the next item on the agenda
[2/17/23, 8:26:37 AM] Peter Peng: It makes it more real
[2/17/23, 8:27:01 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/17/23, 8:27:04 AM] Peter Peng: Like I want to be able to cash out my tokens
[2/17/23, 8:27:25 AM] Gary Teh: I am sure everyone feels the same 🤣
[2/17/23, 8:27:53 AM] Peter Peng: Haha yeah, no one is going to continue contributing if there is no real incentive
[2/17/23, 8:27:58 AM] Gary Teh: Right now the governance tokens are still sitting in the wallet controlled by me

That from a decentralization perspective is highly undesirable
[2/17/23, 8:28:20 AM] Peter Peng: Think about it
[2/17/23, 8:28:27 AM] Gary Teh: True. We are still short of USd5000 to setup liquidity pool based on radium though
[2/17/23, 8:28:51 AM] Gary Teh: That is correct 

Been on the back of my mind
[2/17/23, 8:28:53 AM] Peter Peng: You can do it for less
[2/17/23, 8:29:06 AM] Peter Peng: 10k is just recommended
[2/17/23, 8:29:14 AM] Peter Peng: If you read docs
[2/17/23, 8:29:39 AM] Gary Teh: I see. Been too busy. Glad that you surfaced this

[2/17/23, 8:37:13 AM] Gary Teh: Was semi joking with @6594897484 last year about sinking all my assets into the liquidity pool for TrueSight DAO after setting it up and then disappearing for good into the desert after that to replicate Bitcoin’s Satoshi. 🤣

The interesting thing would be to observe what actually happens after that 

Two possibilities I could think of 

1) everyone cashes out and project dies 🤣

2) the project actually starts growing 🤔

[2/18/23, 11:01:14 AM] Brian -IOM: Bit boy crypto believes this SEC pincer movement is about getting rid of BUSD (and perhaps even Tether), as well as to dissuade other players from bringing their stable coins. So in other words Circle has already been chosen.
[2/18/23, 11:02:01 AM] Brian -IOM: USDC
[2/18/23, 11:03:09 AM] Gary Teh: @447492703707 are you voting for USDC??

[2/18/23, 11:05:57 AM] Brian -IOM: Nice one! 👏

[2/18/23, 12:01:46 PM] Gary Teh: One key thing that keeps coming back to mind as I think about decentralized data piping to train decentralized AI is the need for a decentralized queueing system that functions very similar to either Redis or RabbitMQ
[2/18/23, 12:01:58 PM] Gary Teh: Right now there is not such system available
[2/18/23, 1:49:33 PM] Tres Garcia: I think tether has done enough self harm to lose market share on its own. Will take time to build it back. 

SEC can’t really dictate what happens with Teather or stable coin because it’s not a security/ can’t pass the howie test & not US based. 

The OCC can go after Teather requiring a banking license or money transfer license
[2/18/23, 1:50:54 PM] Tres Garcia: So SEC makes noise to see if USDT de pegs…. If yes. They win… if not then OCC will have to take lead. 

Since it didn’t depeg after Luna, I think USDT will live on
[2/18/23, 2:04:48 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not worried about any government age I
[2/18/23, 2:04:54 PM] Peter Peng: *agency
[2/18/23, 2:13:06 PM] Brian -IOM: The hypothesis I heard was that the SEC is going after crypto banks like Silvergate and there is one such bank that has ties to Tether that could act as an attack surface. It’s not my area of expertise - but the coordinated approach to the crackdown isn’t a coincidence, they’re clearing a path for a digital dollar.

[2/18/23, 2:17:26 PM] Peter Peng: Like Bitcoin
[2/18/23, 2:24:12 PM] Brian -IOM: New payments messaging standard - ISO20022
[2/18/23, 2:26:10 PM] Brian -IOM: ALGO, XRP, XDC, XLM, CPH, ADA +++
[2/18/23, 4:02:39 PM] Tres Garcia: Cool idea. But I guarantee there is no secret cabal putting that into play. (No resources and No need)

The minute a digital dollar comes online it will be the global standard backed by the US Fed Govt. No need to compete with USDC / USDT or other inferior competitors.
[2/18/23, 4:04:09 PM] Tres Garcia: If everyone else is playing with / on ISO20022 standards, the digital dollar gate keepers will be commodities and rent seeking.
[2/18/23, 4:42:05 PM] Peter Peng: If people found out the US government created Bitcoin it would go to zero.
[2/18/23, 4:42:24 PM] Peter Peng: So they will deny any involvement
[2/18/23, 4:43:19 PM] Peter Peng: There is no need for a digital dollar, but they will fund certain coins
[2/18/23, 4:53:14 PM] Brian -IOM: Maybe that’s what that salty old business tycoon who says “if you ever found out who invented Bitcoin, it would go to zero” meant! 😂

What a lousy journalist. This is very inaccurate and bad reporting. 

The correct way to write it is 

“Al-Omar oil field is the largest Syrian oil field. The US is currently LIBERATING the oil field from COMMUNIST/TERRORIST forces, and has  repeatedly RECOVERED Syrian oil to the tune of billions of dollars for some ESG Purposes or to Reduce European oil shortages from Russian Oppression.”

[2/23/23, 12:52:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: 🚨 China directly confronts USA

📝 an open letter on the China ministry’s website for the world to see

https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2023-02-21/china-calls-usa-out-publicly
[2/23/23, 12:52:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: And it’s evidence based contents are undeniable
[2/23/23, 12:53:03 PM] Peter Peng: Oh a letter, so scary 😂
[2/23/23, 12:53:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: The pen. Is mightier than the sword.
[2/23/23, 12:53:52 PM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂 something China would say…
[2/23/23, 12:54:17 PM] Peter Peng: When was the last time they’ve been to war? Ming Dynasty 😂
[2/23/23, 12:54:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: The English words "The pen is mightier than the sword" were first written by novelist and playwright Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1839, in his historical play Cardinal Richelieu.
[2/23/23, 12:54:43 PM] Peter Peng: They have no idea 🤷‍♂️
[2/23/23, 12:55:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: Which is good actually. Peace loving people they are
[2/23/23, 12:56:04 PM] Peter Peng: Good, they should keep it that way
[2/23/23, 12:56:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Shows your obvious bias ness if a well known English idiom can be attributed to China. Lol
[2/23/23, 12:56:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Everything is china’s fault to u.
[2/23/23, 12:57:05 PM] Peter Peng: No, mainly blame Russia
[2/23/23, 12:57:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Next u will be blaming a tropical storm or an act of god by the Chinese gods
[2/23/23, 12:57:44 PM] Peter Peng: No, it’s weather modification done by the US government
[2/23/23, 12:58:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: True. Us thinks they are gods anyway
[2/23/23, 1:00:11 PM] Peter Peng: I mean it’s something they make laws regarding

[2/23/23, 1:05:35 PM] Peter Peng: We are about to disarm their AI capabilities as well 😏
[2/23/23, 1:12:10 PM] Kelvin Chew: Exactly what the letter says as well.
[2/23/23, 1:12:19 PM] Kelvin Chew: My gosh Peter. Did u just agree with China?!
[2/23/23, 1:12:27 PM] Kelvin Chew: Have they infiltrated u?
[2/23/23, 1:12:37 PM] Kelvin Chew: Are u a spy from China?
[2/23/23, 1:12:50 PM] Peter Peng: It says that in the paper?
[2/23/23, 1:13:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: U obviously did not read
[2/23/23, 1:13:05 PM] Peter Peng: No
[2/23/23, 1:13:06 PM] Peter Peng: Lol

[2/23/23, 1:13:41 PM] Peter Peng: I have my sources
[2/23/23, 1:13:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: China obviously. Since u just agreed
[2/23/23, 1:14:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: Tsk tsk tsk
[2/23/23, 1:14:22 PM] Peter Peng: Where in the paper does it say that?
[2/23/23, 1:14:42 PM] Kelvin Chew: Read it. Instead of a keyword search
[2/23/23, 1:14:51 PM] Peter Peng: I honestly don’t care enough to read it
[2/23/23, 1:15:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: Then have ur sources in China explain it to u
[2/23/23, 1:15:55 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe
[2/23/23, 1:16:47 PM] Peter Peng: But no one cares lol 😂
[2/23/23, 1:18:52 PM] Peter Peng: The world doesn’t want to be governed by China or Russia which is why they’ll always lose to the West.
[2/23/23, 1:19:21 PM] Peter Peng: It’s just nature, accept it.

[2/25/23, 1:55:06 PM] Kelvin Chew: “Far from severing trade relations between the BRICS nations, US and NATO efforts to wage economic warfare over the Ukraine conflict have instead brought the countries closer together.  The BRICS are now engaged in bilateral trade which cuts out the US dollar as the world reserve currency and China is pursuing stronger military ties to Russia on top of its increased purchases of Russian commodities.

Given the rising potential for future hostilities between the US and China, their closer associations with Russia could impede the defense of Taiwan or other allies in the Pacific.  In other words, the US government has potentially sabotaged its own interests. “

[2/26/23, 3:06:32 AM] Kelvin Chew: Does ur history go beyond the movie?
[2/26/23, 3:06:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: “The Helots, whose name means “captives,” were fellow Greeks, originally from Laconia and Messenia, who had been conquered by the Spartans and turned into slaves. The Spartans’ way of life would not have been possible without the Helots, who handled all the day-to-day tasks and unskilled labor required to keep society functioning: They were farmers, domestic servants, nurses and military attendants.
Spartans, who were outnumbered by the Helots, often treated them brutally and oppressively in an effort to prevent uprisings. Spartans would humiliate the Helots by doing such things as forcing them to get debilitatingly drunk on wine and then make fools of themselves in public. (This practice was also intended to demonstrate to young people how an adult Spartan should never act, as self-control was a prized trait.) Methods of mistreatment could be far more extreme: Spartans were allowed to kill Helots for being too smart or too fit, among other reasons.”
[2/26/23, 3:07:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: So slavery is an ideal they were protecting?

[2/26/23, 7:47:31 AM] Tres Garcia: Yes. Thank you! ☝️This is my point on not historically accurate. 

The Spartins (Greeks as a whole promoted Democracy, but also used slave labor to do so)

So to say they were fighting for freedom…. Eeeehhhh…. The freedom to choose the right to vote vs a dictator from a land far away…. More accurate
[2/26/23, 7:48:36 AM] Tres Garcia: Either way, it’s jerks fighting bigger jerks
[2/26/23, 11:46:28 PM] Gary Teh: The truly insightful aspects about Luba (my dance partner) from my perspective is last year, she had to abandon life as she know it by leaving with her mum and her dogs in her car to escape from Kiev 

She was originally thinking of just sticking around but after running up and down multiple times within a day to seek refuge in the bomb shelter at the basement of her apartment she finally gave up on sticking around

There were multiple occasions she had to swerve her car 180 just to avoid being hit by an exploding shell which went off less than 200 meters away from her car

When prodded further (kind of cruel of me she actually broke down in tears in front of me at the dinner table when I did that), she mentions she still sometime wakes up from her nightmares at night trembling in fear that she would lose her dogs and mum, the only things she left that she love. On these occasions she would go sit and hug her dogs for hours until she fell asleep again 

Europe has granted she and her mum asylum status with temporary visa which renews every year. There is a small community of them living together in southern France 

She is hoping to head home soon but have no idea when that would happen. Lagging any certainty, her life is hanging in the limbo 

She been practicing Shad Guru’s inner engineering which @5511982667030 has been a big fan of, for the past 4 years. 

I actually wonder if she would coped differently if she hadn’t done so

I love the footage you made of south Argentina by the way, it looked so beautiful 🤩

[2/27/23, 5:55:57 AM] Gary Teh: Had this insightful conversation on the side with @5491125130580 just now which I thought might be “useful” to share here 

The general ratio of men to women on the ballroom dance is basically 1 men is to 5 women. 

While the ratio of men to women in regular dance clubs is 5 men to 1 women

The uneven distribution is very awkward 

General complains from women on the ballroom dance floor here in South America 

1. Men generally don’t know how to dance. Mainly because they refuse to learn it as it’s not consider manly

2. Women are sometimes forced to dance the role of “men” during ballroom dances due to the general lack of male dance partners

3. They are kind of tired of having to play “men” on ballroom dance floors. It’s opposite of their intention of coming to the ballroom dance floors in the first place which was to feel like “woman” again, especially when modern workplace has been designed to incentivize masculine behavior

[2/27/23, 5:57:53 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be the same general feedback I had from @5511982667030 when she came visiting in the US a few years ago during which we went for tango lessons together in Palo Alto 🤔
[2/27/23, 6:01:26 AM] Peter Peng: They should serve lots of alcohol at ballroom dance and I’m sure men will be there 😂
[2/27/23, 6:01:28 AM] Tres Garcia: 1. The continuation of rail services for the nation > needs of the town. This seems pretty obvious to me after playing years of SimCity. It’s like SimCity 101. 
2. Hazardous chemicals and you stayed? May want to evaluate your decision making process. 
3. I’m hearing you can’t trust the governor or local help…. So what will the Pres Visit accomplish? He is a man… not a magician. 
4. Leave Ohio for greener pastures.
[2/27/23, 6:02:10 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way we’ll want to dance

[2/27/23, 6:09:21 AM] Peter Peng: Why is ballroom dance a feminine thing?
[2/27/23, 6:10:02 AM] Gary Teh: I would assume it has to do with All the swaying off the butt for side to side and the flowery flourishes
[2/27/23, 6:10:04 AM] Peter Peng: I thought it was originally intended for a man and woman.
[2/27/23, 6:10:43 AM] Peter Peng: I think that it’s more of a classy thing
[2/27/23, 6:11:14 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why there are more women 😂
[2/27/23, 6:11:49 AM] Gary Teh: Perception shifts across generations

[2/27/23, 6:14:28 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective Actually just like hacking (white hat studying how black hat do their stuff), to first dance well you need to spend time studying how both the men and women moves

Only then the dance lead understand what is the most enjoyable and also creative next move in the dance
[2/27/23, 6:15:33 AM] Peter Peng: Sounds like “next move prediction” generative AI model for robots o

[2/27/23, 6:26:16 AM] Gary Teh: After two weeks out at sea, I am starting to be of the opinion cruises are really good way to know more people 

They are way more effective than general networking where people bump into one another and then leave sometimes never to meet again 

In a cruise, you keep on bumping into another during separate events over the duration of the cruise

New relationships are allowed to form naturally 

The way the ecosystem is naturally setup feels like the one experienced at the house of balance in Davos Switzerland when I was there this past two years

[2/27/23, 6:51:56 AM] Gary Teh: Too self conscious perhaps? 🤔

I remember spending the first few days studying the physical movements of couples on the dance floor to figure out the underlying principles before finally inviting my first partner to the floor. 

Or more accurately she (Luba) just invited herself. 

I remember finally getting the “aha” moment one evening, and then feeling someone tapping me on the shoulder just when I was relaxing from the concentration of studying and mimicking someone else’s movement. 

Turning around to see her and then transitioning into a coupled dance with her just felt like the most natural thing to do especially when the next music was just starting

Maybe she has also been studying my movements 🤔

[2/27/23, 6:53:35 AM] Peter Peng: You had a real “Titanic” moment here 🚢
[2/27/23, 7:04:45 AM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with Barbara from south Brazil who mentioned the same thing that @5511982667030 mentioned as well 

Somehow the men women ratio here in South America is skewered. There are women than men for reasons unknown 

This same phenomena was observed in Russia. The reasons were more known there though. Alcohol, drug abuse and suicide occurs at a much higher rate in men in those regions. 

Somehow being burdened to shoulder the default role of the “provider” since young actually imposes a lot of psychological load. 

It made sense in the agrarian and the hunter gathering age where having more physical strength did give an advantage. This is not necessarily the case in our current Information Age where being relationship oriented is what provides the advantage. This becomes especially more true as more and more of our work gets automated away leaving what is becoming increasingly more human relationship focused occupations 

From my personal experience being slightly on the autistic spectrum, when a social network becomes denser and  interweaved, the pattern of human relationships becomes more intricate. Beyond a certain threshold I just have to back off and move myself to the edge where there are more free yet defined space. 

You can think of it as being a kind of color blindness. Some people, like Ilya, cannot see the color green with their eyes however hard they try because it’s not in their programming. Others like myself can’t seem to interpret a certain category of more subtle social cues even though it might be glaring obvious to most folks not in the spectrum 🤔
[2/27/23, 7:15:57 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[2/27/23, 7:18:42 AM] Gary Teh: I recall @6594897484 and @5511982667030 mentioned a few times calling me “strong” for being able to handle extended periods of isolation, uncertainty and going totally against social norms (aka social cues)

Actually that is not really case of being “strong” it’s just how the gene was expressed in this body. 

Obviously there are trade offs and as mentioned before (inability to read more intricate social cues)

What I have found to be truly fascinating is how it even showed up in the Bazi readings where bulk of my compositions is in the Seven Killings (七杀) position. The kind of profile you would deploy to remote unknown terrains that are uncharted to do the discovery work before the rest of civilization moves in under the leadership of someone else 🤔

[2/27/23, 7:37:54 AM] Gary Teh: Checking out of Marriot hotel now (Elton has been really kind to share his suit with us yesterday) 

Finding myself a hostel to check in now. Back to being the Hobo 🤣

Seems he is planning to do vanlife next year in North America after finishing South America this year. 

He is going to speak with his friend about the sailboat purchase from Hawaii for resale in Jakarta once he gets back to Indonesia this October. 

If it works out then most likely we will carry out our plan in 2025. Likely Luba is going to help us captain the ship since she has been a sailor competing in the Olympics for Ukraine. Both her parents were sailing competitively as well 🤩

On a side note, the same “hobo and resource leader” pattern seems about to start repeating itself yet again. 

The hobo goes in to the unknown to figure out the patterns and the resource leader comes in and foots the bill by pulling together the resources required for executing crazy idea discovered via the patterns figured out by the Hobo. Meanwhile the Hobo dumps all the resources discovered along the way to the resource leader to go figure how to manage 🤣
[2/27/23, 8:06:46 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Being a bit of the opposite. Less intelligent, but capable to grasp social interactions in split seconds and on many different layers, I am just learning that it does not matter. Knowing, seeing and understanding others desires does not get you anywhere. Because it is all about living who you are, pleasing others by just being 100% authentic, making being yourself happy. This authenticity we can only find ourselves. You only have to express yourself. If others don’t understand, it is not your falt, it might just not be for you. So if you are color blind, are you missing anything? I guess your favorite color would be one you can actually see. Or it is one nobody else can see. Either way, you have reason to be happy. Just to be able to adapt to the rainbow, does not help you to find your favorite color. Making any sense at all? 🤪

[2/27/23, 6:04:44 PM] Gary Teh: Based on what I have observed 

Personally from an energy perspective these are the four categories of communications and their respective quota 

1) there seem to be a unlimited quota when it comes receiving and sending written communications. Structured or otherwise unstructured 

2) The same could be said about listening to someone verbally express an structured idea he/she has in his/her head

3) my energy level on a regular day seem to be able to sustain well beyond 10000 words when required to verbally communicate about a structured idea I have in my head 

4) my energy level for the day seem to get fully depleted in under 1000 words when required to verbally communicate with no fixed clearly defined goals (no idea why we are even having this conversation scenario). 100 words in and you start observing me visibly sourcing for the exit before I have to be carried out on the stretcher 🤔🤣

I am always very impressed when I observe how “sales” folks can go on revving about seemingly random and generally disconnected topics for hours. Perhaps I still haven’t really figured out the underlying principle for being able to perform this feat 🤔

[2/27/23, 6:21:21 PM] Peter Peng: Twitter doing bad, Tesla doing bad
[2/27/23, 6:22:29 PM] Gary Teh: Same exact principles dude. 

I utilized some of them on a smaller scale many years ago when working in the publicity and entertain industry back when I was in Singapore to keep the crowd engaged and to ensure the marketing message gets delivered across

First the shock and awe (hopefully laughter of disbelief) and then the slight nudge to imprint the messaging in the head of the target
[2/27/23, 6:24:22 PM] Gary Teh: Usually the messaging needs to be so dumbed down, any regular Joe with an IQ of less than 80 can recall it.
[2/27/23, 6:24:36 PM] Peter Peng: I guess, I don’t find him, Trump or Kanye West relevant anymore

[2/27/23, 6:25:55 PM] Gary Teh: You are technically borrowing the energy derived from the laughter to do the psychological imprinting. Think of it as transaction fees 

Other marketeers utilize “sex” since that also temporarily drive up energy level, sufficient enough for the cognitive imprinting of that dumb down message
[2/27/23, 6:27:22 PM] Gary Teh: It already is, haven’t you heard of bridge waters?
[2/27/23, 6:27:39 PM] Peter Peng: Media is just making a spectacle out of him lol
[2/27/23, 6:34:59 PM] Gary Teh: That is how he drives the viral loop. 

Folks who do not share his belief will ridicule him when they revive the media messaging 

Folks who share his belief will gravitate and support him when they receive the same exact messaging from the same media 

Unless you have spent time tuning your brain to counter your natural disposition we will end up strengthening our beliefs in what we want to believe anyway when presented with a stimulus 

Hence what @6590995199 been talking about when he mentions he need to present contradictory evidence to disturb a person belief. his intention is to help the receipts develop TrueSight (the ability to see what you don’t already believe even if you might choose not to use it for future decision making purposes) 

He is not being argumentative when he does that

The OGs members were brought into this DAO with the deliberate goal of creating such contradictory scenarios

Don’t remember what their names are but the lady was literally twirled 760 in the air and caught when they were performing on stage. All this while the ship was sailing through really rough waters of the drake passage 😱

[2/28/23, 5:51:19 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: So, I'm not worried about you. You're picking up on the information here in the chat and the different opinions. And you're involved in practically every topic. It's not about the amount of words. That can't be a measurement.

What about non-verbal communication? What is the importance of what is not said? There we humans are perhaps differently gifted, as far as the evaluation is concerned. Visually, non-verbal communication can be perceived and translated very well, but in writing it can hardly be captured. Or does Edgar read between the lines? It becomes political here in the chat from time to time and I know that I belong to an unloved minority. Why should I express myself?

What makes Edgar out of much and of little comments? How does it come to the balance that we have already discussed when there is different amounts of communication? How do we distinguish between smalltalk and the core of the message. Schiller once wrote in a letter to Göthe (perhaps it was the other way around): "sorry dear friend, I had no time to be brief."  

simply to throw a few more thoughts into it... It looks like I am not quick enough to follow all conversation
[2/28/23, 5:57:12 AM] Gary Teh: Irony is something that machines can’t fathom yet since a huge portion of it has to do with the contradictory body language
[2/28/23, 5:57:36 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding what is not being said, it is at times way more important than what is already said. Remember William Shakespeare’s Macbeth where the witches convinced him to murder the king by stating what is the truth. But since critical facts were omitted during the presentation it only amount half truths
[2/28/23, 5:58:20 AM] Peter Peng: I love non verbal communication 😏

[2/28/23, 6:05:34 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding belonging to an “unloved” minority 

I remember the conversation I had with @6596983014 last year when we were exploring NFTs. He had been contributing incremental derivatives towards that initiative and then scoring minor increments of governance tokens 

We finally had a chat with @14084823806 after trying to get in touch with him for two months, he immediately identified a few critical flaws in the artistic approach and tore everything  apart. We had to scrape the bulk of the concept and start from scratch. Talk about rocking the boat. His governance tokens holdings made a huge leap. 

@6596983014 asked why was @14084823806 given such a huge governance grant? The response, the flaw was sitting there for multiple weeks and it was only @14084823806 who pointed it out 

Another scenario was when @14075792560 joined our room last year. Him being himself utilizing Degen persona for communications here helped rocked the boat and catalyzed our thinking on what should be and not be encouraged in this space. That rocketed him to become one of the governors 🤔🤣

Just contact @14152032783 to see if he could help make introductions for São Paulo

Will utilize the same set of materials there

All these are for promoting the AID framework that we recently voted to include in our DAO space
[2/28/23, 6:42:49 AM] Gary Teh: Human dynamic wise, I been noticing this recurring pattern  across the previous few working groups I have been in 

Bulk of the time, I am the one mainly involved in figuring out the feasibility potential of an idea and perhaps help slice up the work and distribute it to interested parties 


Human interfacing issue wise back when I was in Singapore @6581766589 handled it for the team that were setup

In the previous company, it was basically all offloaded to Jerry. 

Seems in this DAO, the last time we had some really severe issue, @6594897484 was the one that mediated it. @16468233438 seem to be really good at it as well 


Regarding the task master profile. Ambarish was mainly playing that profile 

Right now in our DAO, I observe @5511982667030 and @918017107841 to naturally fall into this profile 

As for human resource leader profile that bring in a lot of folks, I observe we have a very healthy population of these folks

@19514467219 @48606646246 @2348123243309 @491736386942 @6596168016 @16468233438 @14152032783 @12063955455

[2/28/23, 7:49:01 AM] Gary Teh: Buenos Aires, Argentina 

A night at the hostel here cosy around USD15. So that amounts to around USD450 a month

A meal typical cost around USD8. Since I usually have around two meals a day that is around USD16

So you are looking at around USd1000 base cost

Transport here is less than a dollar

@14075792560 or @12023686334 anyway for you to check the exchange rate for selling Argentinian pesos at the JFK airport for USD?

I was chatting with Elton the other day if the local exchanges in JFK are willing g to buy the pesos for anything less than 290 pesos per USD, we could technically setup a supply run to exploit this exchange rate discrepancy and top up our DAO’s coffers

[2/28/23, 8:49:47 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to be to the cheapest flight on the east coast 

Also since of you are there, it is pretty convenient 🤣

Flying in and out of sF or LA seem cheap but don’t know anyone in our DAO based in LA right now. 

Don’t remember seeing an exchange in SFO the last time I was there
[2/28/23, 8:59:07 AM] Tres Garcia: If you are flying physical cash you will need to declare anything over $10k
[2/28/23, 8:59:32 AM] Tres Garcia: Is Miami cheaper?
[2/28/23, 9:00:05 AM] Gary Teh: Around the same price
[2/28/23, 9:00:15 AM] Gary Teh: Actually cheaper by USD100
[2/28/23, 9:01:16 AM] Peter Peng: Crypto seems easier
[2/28/23, 9:01:30 AM] Tres Garcia: Why not Fund a stable coin address and find an off taker in Argentina? Will save you on the flight costs

Ihatetaxis.com 
1 ARS = 0.13 USD
Commission Rate is 2.5%
[2/28/23, 9:05:27 AM] Tres Garcia: I wonder  if your bank would give you a better exchange rate
[2/28/23, 9:05:57 AM] Gary Teh: So the exchange rate is 1USD for 7 pesos?? 🤔
[2/28/23, 9:06:21 AM] Peter Peng: Roughly
[2/28/23, 9:06:22 AM] Tres Garcia: 🫠 as long as you can decalaire the source of funds for over $10k…. Yeah… you could do that.
[2/28/23, 9:06:50 AM] Tres Garcia: They don’t have a bitcoin vending machines down there?
[2/28/23, 9:07:04 AM] Gary Teh: Still need to fly in to the US with the Argentinian pesos right to on-ramp to USDT right??
[2/28/23, 9:07:37 AM] Peter Peng: Seems like a hassle
[2/28/23, 9:08:15 AM] Gary Teh: Adding additional steps that seems to complicate the transaction chain with not much value add 🤔
[2/28/23, 9:08:40 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah
[2/28/23, 9:09:01 AM] Tres Garcia: I was thinking of:
Work remote and get paid in USD to your bank account. 

Use USD to buy stable coin (transaction fee = low or no fee)

Use coin to purchase Pesso locally. 

Then upload to take advantage of the speard.
[2/28/23, 9:09:20 AM] Gary Teh: Meh… Not interesting 🤷‍♂️
[2/28/23, 9:09:21 AM] Peter Peng: Unless you are getting paid by some drug kingpin to move the money
[2/28/23, 9:09:35 AM] Peter Peng: Then it might be worth it

[2/28/23, 9:11:04 AM] Peter Peng: I would love to rob a drug kingpin from South America if I had the chance
[2/28/23, 9:11:50 AM] Tres Garcia: Do You got plans for the weekend? 😎
[2/28/23, 9:12:30 AM] Peter Peng: CIA special operation

[2/28/23, 9:14:04 AM] Peter Peng: The CIA would just turned the seized cocaine into crack and redistribute it in Washington DC
[2/28/23, 9:14:23 AM] Peter Peng: Not a bad business model 😂
[2/28/23, 9:14:31 AM] Tres Garcia: From the book American Gods: “How do you know the CIA didn’t kill JFK?…. Because He’s dead.”
[2/28/23, 9:15:15 AM] Peter Peng: The CIA used the KGB

Apparently the same is true for neural networks

[3/1/23, 8:33:22 AM] Gary Teh: There are a few steps after this. 

- migrate all our outstanding governance tokens to a common shared vault wallet. So that all future issues can be voted on and approved by all DAO members who hold governance tokens

- sink our outstanding 5000 USDT to our liquidity pool so that an exchange rate between the USDT in our treasury is automatically established with all TDG tokens that have been issued

Once these two final steps have been established DAO members should be able to freely contribute to our DAO, earn governance tokens and then cash these out in USDT.
[3/1/23, 8:33:31 AM] Gary Teh: 🤩👍🏻
[3/1/23, 8:34:27 AM] Gary Teh: Once all these steps are done, it should mean that if I went exploring the Amazon forest sometime next month and some giant size anaconda accidentally gobbles me up, our DAO will still go on without any issues.

[3/1/23, 8:40:30 AM] Peter Peng: Fair enough lol
[3/1/23, 8:42:35 AM] Peter Peng: I still think a whitepaper would help
[3/1/23, 8:42:40 AM] Gary Teh: So all the folks who have contributed this ecosystem so far and have their names listed on our ledger are either insane enough to believe it is possible to create a better world based on verifiable truth or have enough goodwill towards the insane ones who are doing so
[3/1/23, 8:42:58 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to contribute to this insanity 🤣
[3/1/23, 8:43:24 AM] Peter Peng: I would not know where to start 😂
[3/1/23, 8:43:52 AM] Peter Peng: It’s easy to create mine because I’m just trying to get the vision out of my head

[3/1/23, 8:45:45 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah, you need to be obsessed about solving the problem
[3/1/23, 8:46:48 AM] Gary Teh: I feel the only thing I am really obsessed with is not have shitty information sent my way and causing me to make stupid decisions with my time, effort and money
[3/1/23, 8:47:47 AM] Peter Peng: You’ll have to articulate that along with your plan of action in a whitepaper and distribute it
[3/1/23, 8:48:09 AM] Peter Peng: It’s the only way I see the token growing
[3/1/23, 8:48:56 AM] Peter Peng: Even then it’s a hit or miss if it resonates
[3/1/23, 8:49:02 AM] Peter Peng: But it’s worth a shot

[3/1/23, 9:02:29 AM] Peter Peng: It can’t be completely headless
[3/1/23, 9:03:14 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why things are released via a group
[3/1/23, 9:03:35 AM] Gary Teh: I remember having to navigate similar situation when our DAO executed a barter trade (of my time) with Daoveral group (their resources) early last year

They were applying a lot of pressure to centralize the ecosystem through me so that it could be controlled by them. The holdings were still very centralized then (I had more than 35% voting rights versus 7% voting rights right now)

The way we got around the situation was for me to stake away all my voting rights to members of choice during the entire duration of the barter trade
[3/1/23, 9:06:39 AM] Peter Peng: Would be easier to have just exchanged tokens
[3/1/23, 9:06:46 AM] Gary Teh: So I ended up staking my voting rights to members with a strong independent minds and critical thinking

These served as a nice counter balance to the excessive pressure on their side to centralize the ecosystem under command and control directives.

Once it was done, I could just conveniently provide the response that my voting rights were none-existence in the DAO when receiving request for centralization, please speak to the other governors 🤣
[3/1/23, 9:07:57 AM] Gary Teh: Hindsight 20/20.

They didn’t want the utility of the ecosystem

Instead they needed a COO profile to go help their setup some of their projects organization structure
[3/1/23, 9:08:38 AM] Peter Peng: I guess, doesn’t sound like a real DAO
[3/1/23, 9:09:24 AM] Gary Teh: The original Group behind Daoversal was not a real DAO. That was a first thing I discovered when I arrived in Dubai.
[3/1/23, 9:10:23 AM] Gary Teh: Neo, the main guy in charge was always talking about some pump and dump scheme. It was just disturbing to sit in and listen to some of their conversations.
[3/1/23, 9:10:51 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah unprofessional
[3/1/23, 9:11:09 AM] Gary Teh: I guess that is the problem when Cow Boy style Chinese business men meets Crypto.

[3/1/23, 9:38:52 AM] Peter Peng: *same
[3/1/23, 9:44:38 AM] Gary Teh: Not sure dude. They have been migrating their stuff across so many domains 🤣
[3/1/23, 9:44:49 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t keep track of them anymore
[3/1/23, 11:56:57 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 please chat with @41799155602 

I am here right now in the cafe drinking coffee with @5491125130580

@5491125130580 has enough Human Resources available here to setup a game development studio here based in Argentina 

@41799155602 is the CEO of earn.games which gets a lot of requests for game development, @41799155602team does not have enough in-house resources to do that

I think the both of your teams combining forces yields great synergy! 🤩

[3/1/23, 4:12:11 PM] Gary Teh: Had a great discussion with @5491125130580 just now where we speculated on the eventual PH of the water after all the ice bergs (fresh water) melts and all the surface run offs have driven the PH to be as acidic as could ever be. 

In that state is the PH acidic or alkaline? 

An acidic PH would mean a very different reality than an alkaline PH.
[3/1/23, 4:39:27 PM] Gary Teh: One of the alumni’s from the JFDI accelerator took our prediction market, portfolio management use case and did a full fledge implementation 😱

https://www.jezer0x.com/bw-post-mortem/

Outcome was they ended up hitting the same walls we discovered. The main between our approach and theirs, we discovered the walls by just manually testing the behavior before deploying crazy amounts of resources to pursue any build out 

I wished they had just reached out to seek collaboration. I would have happily shared all the insights we gained within the space with them. 

One of them was even involved in the crafting of the technical portion of our white paper (Nishanth the CTO)

His cofounder Krishna (the CEO) was just being strong headed as usual about doing everything alone using the zero sum game web2.0 approach. 

Oh well… 🤔🤷‍♂️

[3/1/23, 5:14:50 PM] Gary Teh: Another interesting pattern re-emerged during the conversation me and @5491125130580 had today at the cafe 

Key insight (I will probably get lynched by a lot of the women folks in this group for surfacing this but in the spirit of open discussion let’s go ahead 😣)

- there is an age old unspoken competition between the women folks in any social settings. And that is based on external aesthetics (use of glamour natural looks, accessories and clothes)

- based on this unspoken attribute, a hidden social hierarchy is established within a network 


Once the pain point of a demographic is established (can’t find dance partner), and the proposed solution (an individual labeled as a dance partner) is publicly social proofed by one occupying a position higher up in the social hierarchy (better dress or naturally endowed, etc… ), that solution will readily gain acceptance by those who self-perceive to be lower on the social hierarchy 🤷‍♂️

The label we use for this class of cognitive bias is called the Authority bias. And the psychological mechanism exploited is called social proofing 

This same pattern can be cross pollinated to other domains. 

1) Enterprise sales: Once an organization manages to bring in a top Fortune 500 client into the fold, the rest will easily follow along so long their budgets are within the same range

2) Fundraising: once a tier one investor is brought into the folder as the lead investor the tier two and tier three investors will naturally want to follow without much resistance 

Are there any other domains you can think of where this pattern is applicable as well?
[3/1/23, 5:42:32 PM] Peter Peng: I think it all comes down to what the individual values. Typically inner beauty will radiate outward but there are the exceptions.
[3/1/23, 5:44:28 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me, the same could be said about driving technology solution adoption within a decentralized community 

Once a figurehead has publicly endorsed a protocol, it quickly gains traction within the community

Simple example is Dogecoin
[3/1/23, 5:45:10 PM] Gary Teh: Jeff Bezos was probably the biggest gorilla in the room until recently when Elon Musk awarded him the silver medal on Twitter
[3/1/23, 5:45:43 PM] Gary Teh: Everytime Elon Musk publicly endorses the dog, Dogecoin shoots up
[3/1/23, 5:45:58 PM] Peter Peng: Not anymore though
[3/1/23, 5:46:30 PM] Peter Peng: He does it all the time now and the price of Doge stays the same, thank god
[3/1/23, 5:48:38 PM] Peter Peng: Elon Musk lost his spark 🧨

[3/1/23, 8:14:39 PM] Gary Teh: Haven’t been on it for more than a month. Who knows 🤷‍♂️

I know Jack Dorsey just launched a new decentralized version of it
[3/1/23, 8:15:04 PM] Gary Teh: Or maybe it’s the greatest fool theory and then monkey see monkey do??
[3/1/23, 8:17:29 PM] Johnson Teh: I called this phenomenon “Lack of Clarity” which is why I kept insisting of seeking the “WHY”

When we ask enuf Why 
We will reach the core

[3/1/23, 10:16:44 PM] Anita Lamprecht: This is so funny. Yes, the crowd just follows. I think it helps to simplify the decision making processes just to trot along the „higher ranking“ and seemingly more successful peers. Seems to be human. 
The dance partner story 😂… is funny though. I will share the wisdom of my mother with you. 😆 as a teenager she gave me the advice to pick the ugly ducklings as dance partners first … because then the more attractive guys feel more secure to approach me. Why? They don’t have the risk of being rejected as they feel to be higher ranking in social hierarchy.
[3/1/23, 10:17:57 PM] Gary Teh: I guess, I must have been the ugly ducking 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:19:23 PM] Anita Lamprecht: Was it a teenager’s dance? 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:19:55 PM] Peter Peng: I was always the shortest kid in my grade, so I always went for the prettiest since I had nothing to lose.
[3/1/23, 10:20:10 PM] Gary Teh: It now explains the phenomena observed in dance clubs in Singapore where somehow the short and fat guys seem to be dancing with the girls

Problem I observed though, they just kept dancing with the short and fat guys the whole night while all the tall strapping guys just stood at the side all night 🤣
[3/1/23, 10:21:05 PM] Anita Lamprecht: The guys then don’t get it.
[3/1/23, 10:21:16 PM] Gary Teh: Well… Half the dance partners were less than my age. 

So I guess I was the safe “Uncle” 🤣

[3/3/23, 12:33:21 AM] Peter Peng: I was only going to release it to my group early for the pre-sale… but whatever lol 😂
[3/3/23, 12:34:18 AM] Peter Peng: I’ve got 3 investors so far 🥳
[3/3/23, 12:35:34 AM] Peter Peng: The whitepaper is basically my vision for the intersection of AI and Web3.

[3/3/23, 7:33:22 AM] Iwona Fluda: None of the above 🤣 China has its own agenda and no one knows what's on it.

https://truesight.me/about-us
[3/3/23, 10:02:39 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the cleanest approach moving forward proposed by @41799155602 last year surfaced again when our open format chat went further in the direction of governance today.


Our DAO will only be in charge of making sure the governance tokens still sitting within our treasury vault are issued  out based according to our commonly agreed upon rules (aka our rubric).

We will not hold or control any assets in our treasury. 

Anything happening out in the wild is beyond our scope, examples include
    - someone deciding to create a market between our governance tokens and some prevailing crypto-currency (via the serum protocol)
    - someone deciding to sinking funds into the market's corresponding liquidity pool to establish a prevailing exchange rate (via the raydium protocol)


Any successful project who has benefited from our DAO's early on support that wants to contribute back to our DAO can do so by staking USDT in the liquidity pool established between our governance tokens and USDT at their own discretion.

The bunch of us spent a lot of time together helping make House of Balance a success during the event. She and I were manning the sound equipment station 🤩

Mary is going to walk me through two projects she is working on one in the healthcare space and the other quite similar to the John Wick’s Continental concept. I believe there is going to be much synergy moving forward 🙂🙏

Great to be here with you all … looking forward to learning, sharing and collaborating!
[3/6/23, 2:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: The AI space is moving really fast. Given the script and training data from existing anime series, the team was able to prime the Stable Diffusion AI library to create an entire animation series 

https://youtu.be/GVT3WUa-48Y

We do know that Users are right now already able to prime ChatGpt for a story 

If you out two and two together, you would have basically automated away an entire industry of creative workers 😱
[3/6/23, 2:40:03 PM] Peter Peng: I think it democratizes the creator economy and AI makes it easier for anyone to create.
[3/6/23, 2:40:30 PM] Peter Peng: I still believe that creative still have the upper hand in creating
[3/6/23, 2:47:38 PM] Tim Fong: I met at eth San Francisco an animation director who said that it empowers the director while removing the need for animators. Her thesis is story telling and prompt engineering will drive the space

[3/6/23, 3:06:35 PM] Gary Teh: I believe @381677448972 DeGods game concept for an RpgGame would probably be more well received by the Web3 audience
[3/6/23, 3:23:28 PM] Tim Fong: You stood up the libraries yourself to generate these versus using the interface?
[3/6/23, 4:51:33 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah. It wasn’t rocket science  🤷‍♂️

Generally given enough time and effort anything can be built 

The general problem as usual is no market demand 

A lot more ideas were tested and killed than folks realized behind the scenes

[3/6/23, 5:13:30 PM] Peter Peng: Well you need to do it for yourself
[3/6/23, 5:13:48 PM] Peter Peng: Then people buy in
[3/6/23, 5:15:14 PM] Peter Peng: Like the $GPT whitepaper I made it for myself… I was suprised when people bought a few thousand dollars worth of token on the first day.
[3/6/23, 5:15:42 PM] Peter Peng: It was just something I took the time to do
[3/6/23, 5:15:48 PM] Gary Teh: I observe my needs recently are mainly electronic and mechanical engineering related, since bulk of my interest have shifted to off the grid living giving what I am seeing happening to our environment 

That is why I haven’t been writing much code. Much of the work is figuring out how to put the physical parts together and get them to work in the middle of nowhere 🤣

But since I am right now still slowly hauling my ass northwards from South America to the desert. Actual implementation work is still on hold
[3/6/23, 5:15:51 PM] Peter Peng: It’s about the energy put in
[3/6/23, 5:15:59 PM] Tim Fong: Do you have the source prompts for these?

[3/6/23, 5:20:09 PM] Gary Teh: The way I see it, helium should be what’s used to keep the ship afloat, propellers are just for stabilization and directional control

[3/6/23, 5:20:52 PM] Gary Teh: Off the grid on international waters. 70% of the world’s surface area suddenly opens up and becomes available

[3/6/23, 5:23:00 PM] Gary Teh: Still trying to figure out the weight trade off ratio of floating solar power Bitcoin miners over international waters 

If that works, we are literally looking at setting up a parallel world order as to the ones US allies and the Chinese side are trying to impose on us
[3/6/23, 5:24:32 PM] Peter Peng: If you are woke, you go broke.
[3/6/23, 5:24:58 PM] Peter Peng: Basically the new rule of law
[3/6/23, 5:26:03 PM] Gary Teh: I hear that word thrown around by folks in the Bay Area a lot coupled with rolling eyes when they describe other folks in the ecosystem 

I still have no idea what that word really means
[3/6/23, 5:28:34 PM] Peter Peng: Basically the New World Order is complete
[3/6/23, 5:29:25 PM] Peter Peng: If you are off the grid, you’ll basically be broke
[3/6/23, 5:30:10 PM] Peter Peng: Even the spiritual grid
[3/6/23, 5:30:20 PM] Peter Peng: This is what I’m sensing
[3/6/23, 5:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: See you on the other side
[3/6/23, 5:33:36 PM] Gary Teh: 🫡
[3/6/23, 5:33:49 PM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to keep pace with innovation so I don’t go bankrupt hahaha
[3/6/23, 5:34:49 PM] Peter Peng: The wave is coming 🌊
[3/6/23, 5:36:19 PM] Peter Peng: If you aren’t trying to be a millionaire/billionaire getting a plot of land is good.
[3/6/23, 5:40:00 PM] Peter Peng: Lots of traditional VC funds aren’t able to raise new funds. The only two sectors are generative AI and Web3
[3/6/23, 5:40:37 PM] Peter Peng: I’m seeing the old web2 SaaS model dying
[3/6/23, 5:49:22 PM] Gary Teh: I remember Brian and our early investor Manish telling sharing a story about how when working back in Google Larry Page always nag at engineers to think more fundamentally about the problem 

With the changing world order as Ray Dalio described in his book, it makes sense to look beyond fiat denomination and examine the underlying resources when considering what is wealth. 

The fact that a plot of land can be worth USD0.01 cent per square meter one year and then sky rocket to around USD100 the next tells either one of two things 

1) It’s easy to get fiat rich. 
2) there is something fundamentally wrong about our valuation system and the seams are starting to come apart
[3/6/23, 5:51:17 PM] Peter Peng: I’m hoping that the Metaverse will be able to stabilize land prices
[3/6/23, 5:52:19 PM] Peter Peng: So people can make quick returns in the Metaverse
[3/6/23, 5:52:40 PM] Peter Peng: Vs. playing with real life land prices
[3/6/23, 5:53:59 PM] Peter Peng: This is my thought, but the Metaverse may not change anything at all 😂

The US version is a little different… but just as good.
[3/6/23, 10:57:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not don’t have. No incentive to offer. Reward issues
[3/7/23, 2:52:05 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Even after fixing the reward issue with the jackpot concept (up to 25 million uSD for top player for the month) that you can up with still no one was interested 

That was when we decided to just can this idea and move on
[3/7/23, 3:11:02 AM] Gary Teh: But it’s been pretty amazing to see how all the various conceptual parts of this idea came together

I was only thinking of maybe someway of establishing a record on blockchain 

@6594897484 came into the picture and said the idea was shit. Focus on the trading buy sell signal instead 

Then @6598383264 came into the picture and looked at the idea and again said it was shit. It was missing the retention component and needed to be more Squid game like to be exciting 

Then @6590995199 who has a background in professional gaming came in and looked at it again and again said the idea was still shit. Introduced the jackpot component for the game 

I remember the rest of the folks were busy about to go develope the game when I figured that was risky resource wise for everyone so went ahead and tested the concept against our target audience before it was even built yet 

And finally figure despite best efforts, shit remains as shit. So just finally canned that piece of shit 🤣

https://t.me/Conclave_Channel
[3/7/23, 4:42:43 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly will be speaking of the kind of use cases that I have surfaced already, as well as the ongoing concerns I had expressed earlier
[3/7/23, 6:15:35 AM] Gary Teh: Since the audience will be mainly African, will surface for discussion the lack of opportunity the African have to follow the path towards prosperity the Chinese had by being the low cost manufacturing destination. This is primarily because Robotics and AI is going to make a lot of the human labor redundant there

[3/7/23, 11:26:47 AM] Gary Teh: In case, I get shot though, our vault management for our governance tokens is already in place. So our DAO will not be much impacted
[3/7/23, 11:27:35 AM] Peter Peng: You should list all tokens on the exchange
[3/7/23, 11:28:22 AM] Peter Peng: To become tradeable / liquid
[3/7/23, 11:28:43 AM] Gary Teh: It’s already in the process of being listed
[3/7/23, 11:29:06 AM] Gary Teh: Once that is up, The only part left is setting up the liquidity mining via Raydium
[3/7/23, 11:29:41 AM] Gary Teh: Beyond that folks here could freely define what our governance tokens mean and go crazy on it 🤩

I am at this point, really really tempted to start an open source software project that allows any community who are happy to manage their own servers to simply spin up their own systems to manage their own community tokenization activities just to counter balance this phenomena I am observing

A company that recently spoke to Tiff who is one of the community leader of house of balance was requesting for USD15K per month!?! 🤔

[3/7/23, 6:36:13 PM] Gary Teh: That is determined by how many number of people willing and interested to continue playing the game, month after month 

If people lose interest after a while and churn, then the jackpot size will not hit that amount. 

However problem is upon testing we realized people’s interest don’t sustain long enough for the compounding to happen
[3/7/23, 6:40:56 PM] Kelvin Chew: I know the algo bro. I designed it. 

All I am saying is. Your initial bait is not big enough. Hence don’t say compounding. You can’t even get the small fishes interested with almost a negligible bait
[3/7/23, 6:49:00 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Maybe the game should have more enticing rules and a road map?
[3/7/23, 7:08:06 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah, the way I saw it given the lack of retention, it was unlikely it would last past the initial jackpot 🤔
[3/7/23, 7:08:20 PM] Gary Teh: Happy to revisit the assumption though 🙂👍
[3/7/23, 7:29:37 PM] Gary Teh: @8618926086648 @14152032783 and @5491125130580

The way I see, perhaps just as an extended experiment let’s see if we could run the same exact event in every single city between Buenos Aires and LA here in Americas which has an OffChain community presence as I head north while passing through overland 

That should really help refine the events planning specific section of the Rubric as well as energize the OffChain nodes 🤣
[3/7/23, 8:14:59 PM] Gary Teh: Should probably do the same too for the Eastern European block after I am done with Davos in Jan 2024

After the prior survey my sense is Eastern Europe is more interesting from the decentralized movement than Western Europe with the exception of Portugal
[3/7/23, 8:19:02 PM] Jonathan: This would be great. Though we don’t have much yet in Latin America we can try to set it up on the way

[3/7/23, 9:22:32 PM] Peter Peng: I also feel like I’m Web3 lots of companies don’t get acquired. I’m trying to understand if it’s because we are all still too early or that the Web3 model works well enough where small companies can co exist and thrive independently
[3/7/23, 9:22:42 PM] Peter Peng: *in Web3
[3/7/23, 9:29:12 PM] Peter Peng: Or all the companies end up going banks
[3/7/23, 9:29:18 PM] Peter Peng: Bankrupt
[3/7/23, 9:29:25 PM] Peter Peng: 😅
[3/7/23, 9:29:40 PM] Tres Garcia: I’m thinking the ownership & control is too sloppy. No VC wants to deal with “it’s a security…. It’s not a security”… unless it’s FOMO or 100x better
[3/7/23, 9:32:35 PM] Peter Peng: Traditional VC’s are having a tough time raising funds, Web3 VC’s seem to still be raising despite all the government regulatory fog
[3/7/23, 9:34:09 PM] Peter Peng: I’m not worried about the government, they pick and choose who they want to go after
[3/7/23, 9:36:59 PM] Peter Peng: It kind of reminds me of how the black market is run, but digital.

Need to be up in a few hours for @12125181145 walk through of her two digital solutions, the AI virtual summit in Africa that @2348123243309 is hosting, coffee with @5491125130580 to walk through Friday’s plan and maybe some more tango lessons in the evening. 

Figured I should pack in as many lessons as possible before I head out 🤣

It’s really crazy how cheap it is when taking into account the exchange rates. Around USD2 per lesson 😱

I am thinking it might make sense to create a separate WhatsApp channel for folks participating in the upcoming series of talks who are keen to implement the AID framework for their own web3 projects

I believe there is much to be learned from them we could use to help further polish the AID framework

[3/9/23, 12:58:31 AM] Gary Teh: Hey folks, was chatting with @918017107841 these past two days. 

Seems within various projects as well as in the main beer hall the ongoing discussions periodically surface very keen insights

She is proposing that we periodically summarize these into a Google doc of sorts where the contents get more structured and then grant access to them for another one who purchase a collection of NFTs we make available on our landing pages. This seem inline with what @19514467219 suggested about the Sunminy project while I was there in Zürich beginning of the year 

Meanwhile, as you might have correctly inferred, there is an initiative to redo our landing pages. The intention is to help people interested to repidly onboard to our DAO by providing an overview of what’s going on.

Seems this is a recurring theme surfaced by various DAO members @48691650760 @48606646246 @19514467219 @5511982667030 @16468233438 @918017107841 @41791555798 @5491125130580

[3/9/23, 1:26:33 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, after chatting with @5491125130580 just now we figured we should create a social mining group the attendees of Friday’s talk who are keen to further explore applying it in their project could join that group

https://chat.whatsapp.com/H6dYxbLULAq5ZHelXqQPAi?

If there are enough interest, we might spin it off as an open source software project with its code freely available on GitHub. 

We might then approach the various chains for grants to sponsor the building of this. The grants will be sunk into the liquidity pool we are establishing 

Developers who contribute to the codebase who be awarded governance tokens which could be cashed out via that liquidity pool
[3/9/23, 1:43:34 AM] Garis Pang: https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/us/csx-train-derail-injuries/index.html
[3/9/23, 1:46:24 AM] Anupa/diya: To place a background. The whole conversation started from the position and value of the community to the onbaoridng of the potential new Dao Members.

As seen, most whatsapp  groups are currently are  conversational mode. We are keen to know the intention and direction of each group.What kind of engagement would members like to participate or would people just want to keep sharing links and insights which is also fine. This will definitely define the purpose of the community and what we define on the website 

There is a lot of valuable resources in each group from my knowledge. Would we like to share "informal" research or just keep it within the groups. Sharing it as a knowledge base would open up much more dialog.

[3/9/23, 1:52:05 AM] Alessandro Mele: Oh wow great to hear, I just did it spontaneously!! 😃👍
[3/9/23, 1:55:31 AM] Alessandro Mele: Was at a conference last night hosted by the international law firm Withers and told them about the idea of creating a DAO to facilitate collaboration across the impact ecosystem and they were fascinated ! Lots of questions came up about governance, control, accountability and how to avoid unethical behaviour! I wish you were there and can’t wait to learn more about it myself ! 🙏
[3/9/23, 1:56:00 AM] Gary Teh: Autonomy is one of the core values of our DAO. And what you just did is exemplary of that 🤩

The other two values are Integrity and Diversity 

To the rest of the folks, I met @447887692903 when I was in Davos earlier this year. We had a long and deep discussion about the monopolistic issues with AI. 

Also had another deep discussions about building a neural network in a decentralized manner to access and value social impact projects which could then be turned into a SaaS service that impact funds could then pay for to use. The proceeds then paid out to community members who have helped trained the neural network 

This is the notion of AIs as property of the commons 🙂👍
[3/9/23, 1:57:18 AM] Gary Teh: Would have loved to have been there

DAO as governance framework is definitely gaining more and more traction 🙂

The most important component is the community core values 

All the follow up rules for ethical conduct then stem from those set of core values

This means two different groups structured with the same initial governance models but with different core values embedded might end up behaving very differently and evolve in different ways

That is one of the key things I observe when contributing to House of Balance, OffChain and TrueSight DAO
[3/9/23, 2:03:01 AM] Alessandro Mele: Amazing insights
[3/9/23, 2:11:19 AM] Gary Teh: And it is also the same set of core values that lead to the kind of projects that the community end up discovering and adopting
‎[3/9/23, 2:12:04 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/9/23, 2:14:18 AM] Gary Teh: The core values attract the kind of folks who these core values resonate with 

The folks then discover activities within their surroundings that allow them to actualize themselves (enacting their core values in their daily life)

In that regard, not very different from religion 🤔

[3/9/23, 2:23:19 AM] Alessandro Mele: Love it! I think each human on earth is on a journey of self realisation, the beauty of it is that it’s totally individual although we are all the same

[3/9/23, 2:26:35 AM] Peter Peng: Self realization and self actualization show up in so many different ways and it’s not always as “butterflies and rainbows” which is the best part 😅
[3/9/23, 2:28:03 AM] Gary Teh: I was sharing with a friend that Steve Jobs really got it during his pilgrimage to India 

It’s really about actualizing your core values. Deep down Everyone know what theirs is if they really spend time to sit in stillness

In his case, it was Beauty. And that core value was actualized in Apple 

https://youtu.be/-z4NS2zdrZc

In hindsight, the reason for the exercise that @6598383264 got me to do for a whole month (literally sit and do nothing and just asking why even bother doing this) which he generally gets all the executive teams he advice to do is apparent
[3/9/23, 2:29:38 AM] Gary Teh: And Sometimes they actualize to become trillion dollar companies 🤣

In case new folks don’t know, @16504369509 been working on building a DAO that utilizes our social mining framework to help build housing for the homeless in Oakland. 

houses are built using scavenged materials and volunteers time. When volunteers do so they are awarded tokens 🤩

Why it works for the United States is because our immigration system has allowed us to become a microcosm of the world. A Petri dish per se as we have people from all nations living within our democracy and not under authoritarian rule like the other superpowers. If Free World fails, the rest of the world will surely fail.
[3/12/23, 6:45:44 AM] Peter Peng: *same power
[3/12/23, 6:48:34 AM] Peter Peng: For example, we needed to drop the bomb on Hiroshima to end the world war. Some may deem that as evil but it changed history forever and we have not seen a war like that since.
[3/12/23, 6:49:34 AM] Peter Peng: ^ what I mean by “power corrupts”

[3/12/23, 9:24:49 AM] Peter Peng: I already tucked up a zombie in SF
[3/12/23, 9:24:53 AM] Peter Peng: Fucked
[3/12/23, 9:25:14 AM] Peter Peng: I was attacked last time I was there
[3/12/23, 9:27:33 AM] Gary Teh: Actually this pattern is one of those that from my perspective very hack worthy. 

Imagine if you could somehow streamline and optimize this, you could basically business develope into any industry of desire.

My sense is if such a methodology does exist, folks new to business development activities would find it reall useful. 

It’s way more effective than the 1% hit rate that I heard is the batting average for business developers I spoke with

[3/12/23, 9:28:33 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah you don’t have to think too much
[3/12/23, 9:31:59 AM] Gary Teh: Actually not true. 

I am just looking at the blockages experiences by the various projects I observe including the JETSON X project which we have token holdings in. 

The bulk of lack in progress is precisely this choke point. The lack of a effective pathway to the insiders. 

Until the IN is obtained, the project operators just remain as outsiders and end up wasiting a lot of waiting time 

One of TrueSight DAO’s core activities is RnD. And this recurring choke I observe happening across various projects on our radar deserves our attention
[3/12/23, 9:33:00 AM] Peter Peng: The NFT I gifted you?
[3/12/23, 9:33:29 AM] Peter Peng: JETSON X is not a project under this DAO
[3/12/23, 9:33:40 AM] Peter Peng: What project are you referring to?
[3/12/23, 9:34:12 AM] Gary Teh: The underlying project of the NFT 

How has the progress on that been? 

Also listening deeply to @918017107841 and @19514467219 feed back on lack of progress and engagement, my sense is this is actually the choke point
[3/12/23, 9:34:40 AM] Peter Peng: GPT protocol is underneath it
[3/12/23, 9:34:45 AM] Peter Peng: So going well
[3/12/23, 9:34:46 AM] Gary Teh: Since this DAO owns that NFT, we are technically shareholders to your project
[3/12/23, 9:35:00 AM] Peter Peng: Not really, I just gave you one lol
[3/12/23, 9:35:05 AM] Peter Peng: You didn’t purchase it
[3/12/23, 9:35:23 AM] Peter Peng: I was being nice lol
[3/12/23, 9:35:40 AM] Gary Teh: And I in turned gave it to the DAO

So as shareholders to your project, it is good as project lead that you periodically give updates on it to token holders 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:35:54 AM] Peter Peng: I do
[3/12/23, 9:35:58 AM] Peter Peng: Via email
[3/12/23, 9:36:31 AM] Peter Peng: GPT protocol is underneath it and I have actually shareholders underneath the LLC that put money into it
[3/12/23, 9:36:37 AM] Gary Teh: Do repost them here sometimes so that DAO members have an idea of what is going on with the underlying project behind that NFT
[3/12/23, 9:36:44 AM] Peter Peng: Lol
[3/12/23, 9:37:17 AM] Peter Peng: You left the GPT Protocol chat
[3/12/23, 9:37:43 AM] Gary Teh: That chat has poor quality control dude
[3/12/23, 9:37:53 AM] Peter Peng: Oh well lol
[3/12/23, 9:38:04 AM] Peter Peng: You can return my NFT if you’d like
[3/12/23, 9:38:07 AM] Gary Teh: Immediately within 1 day of joining, I get a whole bunch of spam messages
[3/12/23, 9:38:27 AM] Gary Teh: You can propose this to the DAo and DAo can vote 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:38:53 AM] Peter Peng: It’s fine
[3/12/23, 9:39:07 AM] Peter Peng: You can just return it lol
[3/12/23, 9:39:19 AM] Peter Peng: It was a gift
[3/12/23, 9:39:32 AM] Peter Peng: Which now I regret giving
[3/12/23, 9:40:08 AM] Peter Peng: You need to learn to appreciate
[3/12/23, 9:41:13 AM] Peter Peng: You will learn how to be grateful, just wait 😏
‎[3/12/23, 9:44:49 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 9:45:33 AM] Peter Peng: Not really
[3/12/23, 9:46:10 AM] Peter Peng: You didn’t invest anything
[3/12/23, 9:46:23 AM] Gary Teh: Also via our DAO your project did gain exposure to sections of your market it otherwise would not have. So there was value brought to your project
[3/12/23, 9:46:40 AM] Peter Peng: I gave it to you because I was nice
[3/12/23, 9:46:54 AM] Peter Peng: What exposure?
[3/12/23, 9:47:17 AM] Peter Peng: Please stop taking credit for other people’s hard work
[3/12/23, 9:47:28 AM] Peter Peng: That’s quite selfish of you
[3/12/23, 9:47:48 AM] Peter Peng: Especially as you left the chat
[3/12/23, 9:48:31 AM] Gary Teh: You have been promoting your project in this channel have you not? And we have been supportive of that 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:49:25 AM] Peter Peng: I guess but I do that in all channels
[3/12/23, 9:49:41 AM] Peter Peng: No one from there even talks in there
[3/12/23, 9:49:54 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just trying to educate the DAO if anything
[3/12/23, 9:50:04 AM] Peter Peng: *from here
[3/12/23, 9:50:59 AM] Peter Peng: I work very hard on my projects, I don’t need you telling me that there is no activity
[3/12/23, 9:51:06 AM] Gary Teh: That is a conversion rate problem in your funnel and not an acquisition problem 

I have in fact been giving feedback on how you could properly structure your project too so that it’s more receptive to people in the know 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:51:41 AM] Peter Peng: Gary, you need to worry about your own project
[3/12/23, 9:51:48 AM] Peter Peng: Your tokens and liquidity
[3/12/23, 9:52:19 AM] Gary Teh: I am just giving you feedback as an advisor would. 

You are the project lead. It is up to your discretion on whether the input is useful and how to apply it if it is 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:52:23 AM] Peter Peng: I really just see this as a group chat, not a DAO project
[3/12/23, 9:52:30 AM] Peter Peng: You aren’t an advisor
[3/12/23, 9:52:30 AM] Gary Teh: Good inputs 🙂
[3/12/23, 9:52:58 AM] Peter Peng: Sure we are online friends but there is no working relationship here
[3/12/23, 9:53:04 AM] Gary Teh: Token and NfT holders technically end up being advisors
[3/12/23, 9:53:09 AM] Peter Peng: I just want to make that clear
[3/12/23, 9:53:25 AM] Peter Peng: No they don’t it was just a gift
[3/12/23, 9:53:48 AM] Peter Peng: Please don’t overthink it
[3/12/23, 9:53:49 AM] Peter Peng: Lol
[3/12/23, 9:54:03 AM] Gary Teh: So you are telling me your NFTs are worth nothing?
[3/12/23, 9:54:12 AM] Peter Peng: No people bought them
[3/12/23, 9:54:18 AM] Peter Peng: So they have value
[3/12/23, 9:54:27 AM] Gary Teh: Ok got it.
[3/12/23, 9:54:32 AM] Peter Peng: More people will join
[3/12/23, 9:54:44 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not creating some pump and dump
[3/12/23, 9:54:56 AM] Peter Peng: It takes time
[3/12/23, 9:55:40 AM] Peter Peng: Please learn some manners, if someone gives you a gift please say thank you and not complain
[3/12/23, 9:55:55 AM] Peter Peng: That was how my parent raised me
‎[3/12/23, 10:00:13 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 10:01:14 AM] Gary Teh: Such transactions on chain actually have significance especially when you are interacting with a DAO
[3/12/23, 10:02:34 AM] Gary Teh: and I did indicate clearly when you did the transaction I was accepting it the NFT on behalf of the DAO
[3/12/23, 10:03:27 AM] Peter Peng: Great, but again this doesn’t seem like a DAO to me
[3/12/23, 10:03:38 AM] Peter Peng: At first I thought it was
[3/12/23, 10:04:19 AM] Peter Peng: If I’m bringing on a DAO advisor it would be a DAO with a profitable and successful model
[3/12/23, 10:05:02 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I keep asking you how you are generating revenue
[3/12/23, 10:05:28 AM] Peter Peng: But at this point I’ve given up
[3/12/23, 10:05:45 AM] Peter Peng: And focusing on other areas and DAOs
[3/12/23, 10:05:50 AM] Gary Teh: Work in progress. Just like the business models of traditional startups 

Most don’t even generate any revue until into series A
[3/12/23, 10:06:36 AM] Peter Peng: I created my DAO and in less than a month already started generating revenue via the token
[3/12/23, 10:06:59 AM] Peter Peng: So you have no excuse
[3/12/23, 10:07:20 AM] Peter Peng: I am new to DAOs
[3/12/23, 10:07:48 AM] Peter Peng: I put in a lot of work, so that may be the difference
[3/12/23, 10:07:57 AM] Gary Teh: That is not technically revenue. Your sale of tokens fall under fundraising

If you create a startup and raised 1 million USD from your investors, you can’t technically claim that as revenue unless you are looking at it from a pump and dump perspective
[3/12/23, 10:08:27 AM] Peter Peng: It’s bringing in money
[3/12/23, 10:08:30 AM] Gary Teh: The revenue is only generated when someone paid to use the utility you have built
[3/12/23, 10:08:45 AM] Peter Peng: It makes it investable
[3/12/23, 10:09:33 AM] Peter Peng: Selling tokens are a mixture of investment/revenue
[3/12/23, 10:10:08 AM] Peter Peng: Because they can be used as utility within the system investors are looking at this as a performance metric
[3/12/23, 10:10:15 AM] Peter Peng: I’ve been speaking with them
[3/12/23, 10:10:16 AM] Gary Teh: Resources invested by investors don’t just come in money form

Some of TrueSight DAO’s investors invested their personal network into the DAO

And technically there are around three investors who are actively investing more than a thousand dollars worth of fiat every month
[3/12/23, 10:11:14 AM] Peter Peng: Great, put it into the coin
[3/12/23, 10:11:18 AM] Peter Peng: Or token
[3/12/23, 10:11:25 AM] Peter Peng: What’s what I don’t understand
[3/12/23, 10:11:48 AM] Gary Teh: These are already paid out as expenses dude
[3/12/23, 10:12:17 AM] Peter Peng: It goes into a central bank account?
[3/12/23, 10:12:37 AM] Gary Teh: The expense receipt are submitted and then notarized in exchange for tokens
[3/12/23, 10:12:52 AM] Gary Teh: Check the ledger 🙂
[3/12/23, 10:13:07 AM] Peter Peng: The ledge should be in chain?
[3/12/23, 10:13:12 AM] Peter Peng: On chain
[3/12/23, 10:13:57 AM] Peter Peng: Sorry maybe I’m not sure of the expenses or how you run the DAO
[3/12/23, 10:14:21 AM] Peter Peng: All I’m seeing is a guy living out of his car and traveling to Antarctica lol
[3/12/23, 10:14:40 AM] Peter Peng: I’m just here for the political chatter but not business
[3/12/23, 10:15:21 AM] Peter Peng: That’s just my perspective, but I’m only one person
[3/12/23, 10:15:47 AM] Gary Teh: Good inputs 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 10:17:06 AM] Peter Peng: Again, I’m not judging you
[3/12/23, 10:17:16 AM] Brian -IOM: Gary’s on his world tour! 🌎🏆
[3/12/23, 10:17:34 AM] Peter Peng: That’s awesome for him!
[3/12/23, 10:17:47 AM] Peter Peng: That’s why I’m here talking as friends
[3/12/23, 10:18:04 AM] Peter Peng: I think it’s cool
[3/12/23, 10:20:32 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t have anything this interesting going on in my life besides building my company JETSON X and GPT Protocol so I share it from time to time
[3/12/23, 10:20:48 AM] Peter Peng: But created my own channel to talk about it
[3/12/23, 10:21:03 AM] Peter Peng: As big to take away from Gary’s adventures
[3/12/23, 10:21:12 AM] Peter Peng: *not to
[3/12/23, 11:07:00 AM] Gary Teh: Much appreciated brother 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 11:14:09 AM] Peter Peng: No worries, you need to do what makes you happy
[3/12/23, 11:15:53 AM] Peter Peng: At some point you’ll want to make money
[3/12/23, 11:16:09 AM] Peter Peng: But now doesn’t seem like the time
[3/12/23, 11:16:10 AM] Johnson Teh: Dude, I reckon this lacks of action is called the missing of gathering …

Which is why I am still dead sure about property… until human can be wired to establish Nero-network (emotion) without meeting physically…  most cyber interactions will not have much impact 😜
[3/12/23, 11:16:53 AM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: Not yet... But for me this is a great new field of knowledge, research and development "energy based" social dynamics, marketing, innovation, where "vibes" are in the center of it as we shift from materialism to a more "information" and then energy based economy more and more we will see new businesses adopting this mindset it shows a breakthrough in terms of increase in value throughput per energy unit invested/time and helps explore new blue oceans
[3/12/23, 11:18:08 AM] Peter Peng: Yes, there is definitely an energy exchange. There have been people online that have given me millions of dollars. I certainly do care about those relationships.
[3/12/23, 11:19:07 AM] Peter Peng: Sometimes the memo does get missed for some.
[3/12/23, 11:19:47 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the hardest part, you’ll send out and update to thousands of people but the. Some people don’t get it even though they see it.
[3/12/23, 11:20:12 AM] Peter Peng: More and more business is going online so we must learn the new business practices
[3/12/23, 11:24:33 AM] Peter Peng: You are right that in person communication is better
[3/12/23, 11:27:55 AM] Gary Teh: In hindsight, it starts making a lot of sense the facetime sessions that @5511982667030, @918017107841 and @48606646246 periodically call for to discuss about various operational aspects of projects within our DAO.
[3/12/23, 11:31:19 AM] Peter Peng: Yeah I get on FaceTimes with people from GPT Protocol
[3/12/23, 11:31:33 AM] Peter Peng: But usually discussing business
[3/12/23, 11:32:11 AM] Peter Peng: TrueSight is the only group I come to cha
[3/12/23, 11:32:19 AM] Peter Peng: Chat for leisure
[3/12/23, 11:32:44 AM] Peter Peng: Even my own group is all business, I’m barely joking around
[3/12/23, 11:37:51 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished my hour long facetime session with @5511982667030, (me being very chatGpt with the thoughts in my head) she did come up with a very insightful prime. 

What is the value from my perspective of having such a chatroom like this beer hall in our DAO?

- a place to surface unknown unknowns via discussion. A lot of the topics surfaced here ends up becoming trends that inform what potential projects to pursue next

- a place where members of the DAO can come together to get to interact with each other in a generally informal setting

-  a place where useful information about DAO operations can be surfaced, discussed upon and eventually voted upon

- a place where members can have visibility into the kind of value that is exchange hands between various DAO members. In other spaces, a lot of these kind of exchanges are done in privacy so other members who might be able to jump in to participate ends up missing out because they don't know the deal flow is happening. In fact most of the introductions I made, they are done here in this channel except those that have some NDA concerns in place.

On the flip side though, as per the concern @918017107841 @5491125130580 @5511982667030 and @14075792560 rightfully raised, the context becomes really meshed up. 

One of the things that @5511982667030 left me to think about shortly before our facetime session ended is perhaps, it makes sense to extract some of those context and create separate channels for them instead.
[3/12/23, 11:39:46 AM] Peter Peng: I think you keep the “beer hall” the way it I and discuss business within the separate channels like Ecoverse etc.
[3/12/23, 11:40:26 AM] Peter Peng: You can still be part of other DAOs without it being underneath your DAO
[3/12/23, 11:40:33 AM] Peter Peng: That’s the beauty of it
[3/12/23, 11:40:56 AM] Peter Peng: That’s decentralization
[3/12/23, 11:41:23 AM] Peter Peng: Plus your excel sheet ledger seems very stodgy like a centralized bank
[3/12/23, 11:42:14 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I question if this is a DAO
[3/12/23, 11:43:15 AM] Peter Peng: Because many things seemed to want to be centralized
[3/12/23, 11:45:36 AM] Peter Peng: For example your issuance of token to members are not on the blockchain
[3/12/23, 11:46:05 AM] Peter Peng: Again I’m just one perspective
[3/12/23, 11:46:28 AM] Peter Peng: There is no perfect way to do it
[3/12/23, 11:48:38 AM] Gary Teh: One other thing which I have been considering in my head that @5511982667030 raised again today just a few days after @918017107841 did the other day, much as I try to prevent it from happening, seems "Gary" is fast evolving to become the default figurehead of this DAO (a public persona) though the DAO is supposed to be decentralized. 

And with every talk I end up giving on behalf of the DAO, the effect will only get more and more entrenched. 

it might start making sense to adopted the communication style that @8618926086648 uses in the OffChain channels he manages. To have a clear demarcation between what is personal and kept out of the channels and what is formal and utilized in the channels.

As @5511982667030, my usually contradictory style of communication on works In Real Life. Defaulting largely to just messing and joking around when not in meeting and operational context. And basically zero joking around within meeting rooms.
[3/12/23, 11:48:48 AM] Peter Peng: For all I know the numbers could all be fudged like a centralized bank 🏦 😂
[3/12/23, 11:49:57 AM] Gary Teh: Have you had the opportunity to checked out our vault management solution yet?

https://truesight.me/vault
[3/12/23, 11:51:44 AM] Peter Peng: Okay so have you distributed tokens to members and created liquidity pool?
‎[3/12/23, 11:51:52 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 11:52:22 AM] Gary Teh: Liquidity pool is still being setup.
[3/12/23, 11:52:32 AM] Peter Peng: You say you have $5k in USDT, maybe you should put that in treasury
[3/12/23, 11:52:44 AM] Peter Peng: Then people can vote on it
[3/12/23, 11:53:03 AM] Gary Teh: True. 🙂👍🏻
[3/12/23, 11:53:26 AM] Gary Teh: Planning to do that this coming week. Been so busy with the offchain planning this past week.
[3/12/23, 11:54:00 AM] Gary Teh: I already did mention this before.
[3/12/23, 11:54:08 AM] Peter Peng: Great, your DAO needs this type of governance since there is no blockchain project
[3/12/23, 11:54:28 AM] Peter Peng: You can use the funds to invest in projects
[3/12/23, 11:54:35 AM] Peter Peng: To create equity
[3/12/23, 11:54:51 AM] Peter Peng: Then your DAO becomes investable
[3/12/23, 11:55:18 AM] Peter Peng: Your traveling to Antarctica to see the ice caps melting doesn’t help me make money
[3/12/23, 11:55:22 AM] Gary Teh: Actually one of the things from my perspective, that the DAO needs to vote on is how much of the USDT should be shifted from our treasury to the liquidity pool once its up.
[3/12/23, 11:55:29 AM] Peter Peng: But finding projects to invest in does
[3/12/23, 11:56:05 AM] Peter Peng: Typically 50% goes to liquidity and the remainder goes to developing the product
[3/12/23, 11:56:27 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, it is not my responsibility to help you make money. You are a DAO member, you have the right to exercise your autonomy by figuring out how to make money and submit it as a proposal to the DAO
[3/12/23, 11:56:29 AM] Peter Peng: But since there is no product, then maybe more… but that’s up to you/Dao
[3/12/23, 11:56:47 AM] Gary Teh: I am just one of the DAO members.
[3/12/23, 11:56:53 AM] Peter Peng: I’m only saying if I invest in the DAO
[3/12/23, 11:57:12 AM] Peter Peng: Which I have not besides gift you an NFT
[3/12/23, 11:57:47 AM] Peter Peng: If my GPT project is a success I would invest in more projects and DAOs with the help of my group
[3/12/23, 11:58:05 AM] Peter Peng: Make sense?
[3/12/23, 11:59:30 AM] Peter Peng: If I invest I. The DAO I would say, using DAO funds to invest in projects that can create a return would be key
[3/12/23, 11:59:57 AM] Peter Peng: Need ROI
[3/12/23, 12:00:09 PM] Peter Peng: But I’m just one person
[3/12/23, 12:00:24 PM] Gary Teh: You already did though you didn’t realize

We value not just money as investments. Investment of time and Energy into helping improve our DAO as well as introductions of key people with skill sets needed in our DAo are also considered investments. 

That is why there are line items in our rubric for that 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:00:32 PM] Peter Peng: If that’s not the direction you want to take it I’ll step aside
[3/12/23, 12:00:45 PM] Peter Peng: Money talks
[3/12/23, 12:01:03 PM] Peter Peng: And there will be investors that invest and not say a word
[3/12/23, 12:01:08 PM] Peter Peng: Like they did in mine
[3/12/23, 12:01:14 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 just gave an input that rather than we continue to flood this channel with our discussions 

Happy to bring it offline to chat with you privately if you are keen 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:01:23 PM] Peter Peng: It’s fine
[3/12/23, 12:01:39 PM] Peter Peng: I’m a financial investor
[3/12/23, 12:01:54 PM] Peter Peng: Cuts through the bullshit
[3/12/23, 12:02:40 PM] Peter Peng: But maybe you can just continue to run on sweat equity, but human capital also runs out
[3/12/23, 12:03:38 PM] Peter Peng: That energy being tied to currency is what makes it real
[3/12/23, 12:04:06 PM] Peter Peng: And allows you to participate in an economy greater than just the people in this grow chat
[3/12/23, 12:04:10 PM] Peter Peng: Group
[3/12/23, 12:14:56 PM] Peter Peng: Less running on fumes and more driving toward a working business model is what any investors wants to see.
[3/12/23, 12:15:19 PM] Peter Peng: May require discipline
[3/12/23, 12:27:21 PM] Gary Teh: Speaking of real estate and Antartica 

I just summarized the findings from this recent physical survey I did on behalf of our DAO here on this LinkedIn post 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyjob_climatechange-space-activity-7040412768335777792-rJJo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios

As civilization disruption continues due to climate change and rising sea levels, we should expect some turbulence in real estates as governments are forced to move and create new cities for their citizens
[3/12/23, 12:29:02 PM] Peter Peng: They’ve been saying this for years
[3/12/23, 12:33:26 PM] Peter Peng: Well decades, since I was a kid
[3/12/23, 12:39:44 PM] Johnson Teh: Yes, 
but not to all nations and 
won’t be to all suburbs,

Some mother son is going to die this minute, it doesn’t matter as long it not you or me 😂 … can’t worry that universe will end in 50 years so don’t make money or invest… 

Reckon even if the world ending in 5 yrs time ppl will still want to make some money 😂
[3/12/23, 12:40:59 PM] Johnson Teh: In fact if you believe this is so. 
Then even more you should invest in property, just in higher region haaaaa
‎[3/12/23, 12:42:35 PM] Johnson Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 12:42:37 PM] Gary Teh: That was the point I was trying to make. 

When government moves cities, cheap land prices will suddenly sky rocket!
[3/12/23, 12:42:57 PM] Johnson Teh: Wanna buy some now??  🤑
[3/12/23, 12:43:32 PM] Gary Teh: Have you met up with @41799155602 and @971565972337 

They are based there 

I know Bilal who is very connected to a lot of shieks are based there as well
[3/12/23, 12:44:04 PM] Johnson Teh: Nope, none contacted me
[3/12/23, 12:44:32 PM] Johnson Teh: Let me add them 😊
‎[3/12/23, 12:46:40 PM] Johnson Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 12:51:13 PM] Gary Teh: Please do follow up. 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 12:51:20 PM] Gary Teh: Delicious
[3/12/23, 12:56:47 PM] Peter Peng: Exactly, paying bills, rent, payroll what most people are worried about.
[3/12/23, 12:56:56 PM] Peter Peng: Today
[3/12/23, 12:57:20 PM] Peter Peng: How do we help those people now.
[3/12/23, 12:58:03 PM] Peter Peng: How can we do it with Web3? Especially after the collapse of SVB
[3/12/23, 1:07:14 PM] Gary Teh: Actually @16504369509 is a good person to talk to. He has been helping mobilize the volunteer community in Oakland to build homeless shelters
[3/12/23, 1:08:59 PM] Peter Peng: I’m saying from a funding perspective
[3/12/23, 1:09:08 PM] Peter Peng: Lol they won’t be homeless
[3/12/23, 1:09:13 PM] Peter Peng: Hopefully
[3/12/23, 1:10:10 PM] Peter Peng: Homelessness is more of a societal issue vs. business/financial one
[3/12/23, 1:11:51 PM] Peter Peng: If these startups start moving more Web3 then DAOs can start to finance them
[3/12/23, 1:12:09 PM] Peter Peng: In the wake of SVB collapse
[3/12/23, 1:16:02 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective seeing it from a holistic civilization perspective, our current civil construct is failing an increasing population of our species as it continues to unfold 

I don’t really see societal and business/financial issues as different

Business and financial exist to ensure the resource required for the continued survival and prosperity of humanity is delivered. If these constructs fail their purpose then what is the point of even having this layer of abstract in the first place?? 🤔
[3/12/23, 1:16:41 PM] Gary Teh: Life can become simpler by removing them if they are not serving the needs of humanity
[3/12/23, 1:22:25 PM] Peter Peng: I believe societal issues are usually non-profit
[3/12/23, 1:23:10 PM] Peter Peng: Homelessness is usually dealt with via non-profit efforts
[3/12/23, 1:23:48 PM] Peter Peng: Which it should be
[3/12/23, 1:48:32 PM] Peter Peng: Profiting off of homelessness is not a good thing 😅
[3/12/23, 1:48:52 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 1:52:26 PM] Gary Teh: Just purely for the interest of discussion, what if we transcended beyond for-profit and non-profit, and consider things from a purely Darwinist perspective as proposed by Richard Dawkins in his book the selfish gene 

Obviously the specific set of gene expression (the individual) has not been very successful in extracting resources from the environment for its continued survival, much less the ability to prosper? 

For the greater good of the gene pool, shouldn’t it be just allowed to die off and the remaining resources it’s hogging returned back to the environment for recycling purposes? 

Why then the need for non-profit social initiatives to jeep the hopeless alive? Shouldn’t activities like Euthanasia instead be encouraged? 🤔

[3/12/23, 1:53:57 PM] Brian -IOM: That sounds a bit like Eugenics to me 😅
[3/12/23, 1:53:59 PM] Peter Peng: No, I think we should help them if we can
[3/12/23, 1:54:27 PM] Peter Peng: There are programs for it
[3/12/23, 1:54:43 PM] Peter Peng: Some choose not to receive help

[3/12/23, 1:58:21 PM] Peter Peng: The key is to help yourself so you can help others
[3/12/23, 2:01:34 PM] Peter Peng: Are you moved down there now?
[3/12/23, 2:34:07 PM] Gary Teh: Let me make the introduction too Farouq whose family exports oil from Kuwait to the U.S. 

Seems he recently left this channel too. Same feedback as @5511982667030 and @16468233438 and Franck (who also left the channel recently). 

Too much noise in here to be able to follow actual useful updates about the DAO. 

Definitely starting to feel like we might need to have a separate channel when only actual updates are published for folks who are only interested in news regarding our DAO operations

For now, let’s just use the announcement channel where only governors have admin access to 

I am sure we will figure out something once we had our discussion with @5491125130580 and @918017107841 to accommodate both updates as well as following discussions 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 2:43:42 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. Leaving on 16th March to iguazu 

I only stuck around to give the talk that @5491125130580 and @14152032783had kindly helped put together along with the OffChain community here in Buenos Aires  

The talk was on how our AId socio-mining framework came into being as our DaO evolved

From the profitability perspective of our DAO, the goal is to help onboard projects to this governance model and we in return acquire a chunk of their project governance tokens
[3/12/23, 2:45:18 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware OffChain is in the middle of arranging another gathering in Brazil where we get to the opportunity to share our AID socio-mining framework. 

And likewise the same when I visit Columbia thereafter

The synergy between these two DAOs is great 🙂👍
‎[3/12/23, 2:49:59 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 2:50:37 PM] Peter Peng: Are you planning on finding a place to settle in, have an apartment and open an office at some point?
[3/12/23, 2:51:24 PM] Peter Peng: I know you have aspirations of this DAO being able to take investments and act like a Web3 VC
[3/12/23, 2:53:57 PM] Iwona Fluda: None of the above, but always happy to talk to investors 😂
[3/12/23, 2:54:26 PM] Peter Peng: Oh I was referring to Gary
[3/12/23, 2:54:28 PM] Peter Peng: Haha
[3/12/23, 2:55:18 PM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[3/12/23, 2:55:31 PM] Peter Peng: Forget I asked lol
[3/12/23, 3:01:15 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 3:04:01 PM] Gary Teh: The piece of 1 acre land in the desert we will acquire once I get back to the US will be our headquarters

In the spirit of Burning Man of radical self reliance, If you plan to visit you got to bring your own water and food supplies.
[3/12/23, 3:11:26 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:13:16 PM] Peter Peng: So you will acquire that land using existing DAO funds or your own?
[3/12/23, 3:13:40 PM] Peter Peng: Just trying to understand
[3/12/23, 3:15:33 PM] Gary Teh: I will acquire the land with my own funds and then transfer ownership to the DAO.
[3/12/23, 3:15:50 PM] Gary Teh: In exchange for governance tokens
[3/12/23, 3:17:53 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/12/23, 3:18:22 PM] Gary Teh: That is how we have always been doing it within this DAO.

Whatever the DAO needs OffChain, members will acquire it on behalf of our DAO using their own funds in exchange for governance tokens in it. 

So though there are no significant amount of funds within our DAO, the funds are alway sitting outside waiting to be deployed by DAO members when there are legitimate use for it
‎[3/12/23, 3:20:36 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 3:27:14 PM] Gary Teh: It’s the same as how @16468233438  deployed USD250 last month to cover the franchise renewal fee for the legal wrapper we have use for in the US jurisdiction 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20230209%20-%20Val%20delaware%20renewal.pdf

Fiat Capital is always being raised for needs with our DAO these are however not considered DAO revenue. 

These fall under DAO expenses covered by DAO members in exchange for governance tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:21 PM] Peter Peng: Understandable, how many tokens were awarded to Ken for the drinks? What is the exchange rate?
[3/12/23, 3:29:33 PM] Gary Teh: 40TDG tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:48 PM] Peter Peng: So $1 per token
[3/12/23, 3:29:51 PM] Gary Teh: Val was awarded 250TDg tokens
[3/12/23, 3:29:54 PM] Gary Teh: Yes
[3/12/23, 3:30:19 PM] Peter Peng: Okay so when you create the liquidity pool they can then cash out if they choose?
[3/12/23, 3:30:24 PM] Gary Teh: And when I transfer the land I acquire using my own funds to the DAO. 

Assuming it costed me USD1000. I will be awarded 1000TDG tokens
[3/12/23, 3:30:34 PM] Gary Teh: True
[3/12/23, 3:31:11 PM] Gary Teh: However the exchange rate with be at USD0.003 per TDG token
[3/12/23, 3:31:19 PM] Peter Peng: How many tokens are minted?
[3/12/23, 3:32:00 PM] Gary Teh: 1 billion 

Except those already issued out the rest of them are right now sitting in our vault

https://TrueSight.me/vault
[3/12/23, 3:32:16 PM] Peter Peng: So it’s better to wait and squire TDG tokens at $0.003 USD
[3/12/23, 3:32:21 PM] Peter Peng: Acquire
[3/12/23, 3:32:43 PM] Gary Teh: Token holders need to approve before more tokens can be released from the vault
[3/12/23, 3:32:50 PM] Gary Teh: Up to you 🙂
[3/12/23, 3:32:52 PM] Peter Peng: How many have been issued out in total?
[3/12/23, 3:33:00 PM] Gary Teh: 1.5 million
[3/12/23, 3:33:14 PM] Gary Teh: Check the ledger if you need the exact number
[3/12/23, 3:33:24 PM] Gary Teh: Https://TrueSight.me/ledger
[3/12/23, 3:33:26 PM] Peter Peng: So how will you be able to cover the liquidity needed?
[3/12/23, 3:33:46 PM] Peter Peng: Based on the amount you have issued out?
[3/12/23, 3:33:53 PM] Gary Teh: USd5000 / 1.5 million tokens
[3/12/23, 3:34:13 PM] Gary Teh: The is the exchange rate if you want to cash out now

You get technically get penalized
[3/12/23, 3:34:13 PM] Peter Peng: Okay, so the $5k is already spent
[3/12/23, 3:34:33 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. USD5K is what we plan to pump into the liquidity pool
[3/12/23, 3:34:53 PM] Peter Peng: Right but the’ve already been allocated out
[3/12/23, 3:35:12 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO can vote to split it otherwise
[3/12/23, 3:35:32 PM] Gary Teh: The dao can vote on how the USD5000 should be deployed
[3/12/23, 3:35:34 PM] Peter Peng: Interesting
[3/12/23, 3:35:51 PM] Peter Peng: But I thought it has already been allocated out
[3/12/23, 3:36:14 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. It’s up to the DAO to decide that is what I have stated earlier
[3/12/23, 3:36:20 PM] Peter Peng: Shouldn’t Ken get more than 40 TDG if the exchange rate is $0.003
[3/12/23, 3:36:33 PM] Peter Peng: Okay I’m losing you
[3/12/23, 3:37:00 PM] Peter Peng: If he gave you $40
[3/12/23, 3:37:21 PM] Gary Teh: Nope

You contribute to the DaO on the assumption that each token is worth USD1

If you want to cash out early, you get penalized with the USD0.003 exchange rate
[3/12/23, 3:37:44 PM] Gary Teh: That is how we align the interest of members and the DAO
[3/12/23, 3:37:47 PM] Peter Peng: So basically no incentive
[3/12/23, 3:38:02 PM] Peter Peng: Lol okay gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:38:05 PM] Gary Teh: No monetary incentive
[3/12/23, 3:38:29 PM] Peter Peng: I’m 100% clear now
[3/12/23, 3:38:48 PM] Gary Teh: Ask @14152032783 if he contributed USd40 for drinks because he cared about profit?

He cared about building a community 🙂🙏
[3/12/23, 3:39:23 PM] Peter Peng: Right, but why issue him the 40 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:39:37 PM] Peter Peng: What was the point lol
[3/12/23, 3:39:47 PM] Gary Teh: Notarizing contribution dude
[3/12/23, 3:39:52 PM] Peter Peng: Just be like thanks Ken you are awesome!
[3/12/23, 3:40:09 PM] Gary Teh: That is not the way dude
[3/12/23, 3:40:31 PM] Peter Peng: I see
[3/12/23, 3:41:39 PM] Gary Teh: In case, some of the projects gain traction and start generating profits to push actual cash in vault per issued token over USD1, you want to make sure every single person who has contributed gets properly acknowledged remuneration wise
[3/12/23, 3:41:51 PM] Peter Peng: Sorry I was just looking at the investment potential
[3/12/23, 3:43:56 PM] Peter Peng: When are the token holders allowed to cash out?
[3/12/23, 3:44:23 PM] Peter Peng: As not to be penealized with the $0.003 = 1 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:44:50 PM] Peter Peng: But to have the equivalent $1 = 1 TDG
[3/12/23, 3:45:13 PM] Gary Teh: When the projects amhave successfully generated revenue in amount more than total amount of tokens issued
[3/12/23, 3:45:43 PM] Peter Peng: Which projects?
[3/12/23, 3:46:12 PM] Gary Teh: So if one of our projects end up generating net profit of USD2 million next month then we the exchange rate will be more than 1USD to 1TDG
[3/12/23, 3:46:33 PM] Peter Peng: like Edgar
[3/12/23, 3:47:04 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
‎[3/12/23, 3:47:16 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/12/23, 3:47:35 PM] Gary Teh: More projects will be added and retired depending on DAO evolution
[3/12/23, 3:48:49 PM] Peter Peng: So your liquidity pool with launch with an exchange rate of $0.003?
[3/12/23, 3:49:27 PM] Gary Teh: To be more correct 

0.003333333333333
[3/12/23, 3:50:14 PM] Gary Teh: The exchange rate will go down as more effort is injected into the DAo and the projects don’t make progress 

It’s not very different from how startups work. 

Just think of it as very fluid down rounds
[3/12/23, 3:50:15 PM] Peter Peng: 1.5 million TDG is equal to $4,500 USD
[3/12/23, 3:50:42 PM] Gary Teh: Just divide USDt5000 by all tokens already issued
[3/12/23, 3:50:47 PM] Gary Teh: It’s a floating number
[3/12/23, 3:51:20 PM] Peter Peng: Gotcha
[3/12/23, 3:52:36 PM] Peter Peng: So better to purchase tokens once liquidity pool is launched
[3/12/23, 3:52:45 PM] Peter Peng: As not to get diluted
[3/12/23, 3:54:40 PM] Gary Teh: Well.. that is if existing token holders wants to cash out
[3/12/23, 3:55:38 PM] Peter Peng: I would imagine that’s the point 😏
[3/12/23, 3:56:26 PM] Gary Teh: I would be curious as well to observe who in fact cashes and then do a cross reference to their contribution on the ledger 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 3:59:11 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah, because if you don’t have enough people buying tokens then it will be tough
[3/12/23, 3:59:46 PM] Peter Peng: Who put in the initial $5k?
[3/12/23, 4:01:42 PM] Gary Teh: That is automatically handled by the AMM
[3/12/23, 4:02:09 PM] Gary Teh: The Daoveral group which injected 32K worth of resources last year 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 4:02:33 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it’s like the Zappos experiment on chains
[3/12/23, 4:02:54 PM] Peter Peng: So you still have access to those funds?
[3/12/23, 4:03:10 PM] Peter Peng: Or you have to go through them
[3/12/23, 4:04:57 PM] Peter Peng: When you say “resources” that’s capital?
[3/12/23, 4:09:09 PM] Gary Teh: They have all been deployed already except the USd5000
[3/12/23, 4:09:20 PM] Gary Teh: In various forms
[3/12/23, 4:09:49 PM] Peter Peng: So the USD $5000 they still hold?
[3/12/23, 4:10:28 PM] Peter Peng: What is the amount in USD
[3/12/23, 4:11:00 PM] Peter Peng: How much cash? I’m not concerned with sweat equity
[3/12/23, 4:13:55 PM] Gary Teh: Check the vault end of next week and it will become clear 🙂
[3/12/23, 4:14:39 PM] Peter Peng: Unless there is $5k in the vault / or you control there technically is no liquidity pool
[3/12/23, 4:15:53 PM] Peter Peng: So yeah, you probably want to take care of that ASAP or tokens have no value
[3/12/23, 4:16:11 PM] Peter Peng: From an investment perspective
[3/12/23, 4:18:37 PM] Peter Peng: I’m glad you were honest about where the $5k is
[3/12/23, 4:18:55 PM] Peter Peng: Hopefully you can get that moved into the account
[3/12/23, 4:19:08 PM] Peter Peng: The vault
[3/12/23, 4:22:02 PM] Peter Peng: Let me know if you need help getting that $5k moved over
[3/12/23, 4:22:18 PM] Gary Teh: I have always been very open about

The location has always been documented on the ledger. 🤔

Also on our GitHub profile
[3/12/23, 4:22:40 PM] Gary Teh: https://github.com/truesightdao
[3/12/23, 4:23:19 PM] Gary Teh: I guess it’s either as @5491125130580 says information is all over the place or people don’t like reading documentation
[3/12/23, 4:23:23 PM] Gary Teh: 🤔🤷‍♂️
[3/12/23, 4:24:09 PM] Peter Peng: That’s why I needed clarity because I was under the assumption you had $5k USDT in your possession based on the way you weee speaking.
[3/12/23, 4:24:24 PM] Peter Peng: I didn’t want to assume you cash position
[3/12/23, 4:24:36 PM] Peter Peng: *were
[3/12/23, 4:24:50 PM] Gary Teh: It’s always been sitting into the vault on the TRC chain

We are just consolidating it into realms on the Solana chain now
[3/12/23, 4:25:26 PM] Brian -IOM: 1 TDG = 1 TDG 😎
[3/12/23, 4:26:08 PM] Peter Peng: Basically that’s where I ended up at
[3/12/23, 4:27:21 PM] Peter Peng: I was seeing if I could at least buy myself a cheeseburger 🍔
[3/12/23, 4:27:29 PM] Peter Peng: But not yet
[3/12/23, 4:37:12 PM] Gary Teh: Got to work hard dude. If projects make progress and generates revenue then we will soon be able to buy some burgers by exchanging our tokens 🙂👍
[3/12/23, 4:42:41 PM] Peter Peng: Lol I thought this was so nothing society 😝
[3/12/23, 4:43:36 PM] Peter Peng: *do nothing
[3/12/23, 4:54:37 PM] Gary Teh: That was the other chatroom dude. Dao members who want to chill just go hang out there

Growing and supporting our communities
[3/12/23, 6:46:59 PM] Peter Peng: I have no doubt, I’m just still trying to ponder the whole $1 USD = 1 TDG 😂. But hey, not everything needs to makes sense lol
[3/12/23, 6:48:29 PM] Peter Peng: Spending more time thinking about it makes even less sense.
[3/12/23, 10:24:32 PM] Gary Teh: For the longest time The fact that shares of a company is valued at way more than their book value did not make sense
[3/12/23, 10:24:49 PM] Gary Teh: I feel warmth knowing this brother 🙂🙏

[3/13/23, 4:57:37 AM] Gary Teh: 25% holdings on cryptocurrency
[3/13/23, 5:07:13 AM] Brian -IOM: Liquidity crunch. Interesting thing is that Binance is moving funds from BUSD to BTC and ETH. This is the moment of reckoning: do you want to assume the systemic risks associated with holding fiat in banks or being inside native crypto instead?!
[3/13/23, 5:08:23 AM] Brian -IOM: And isn’t this why we’re all here after all?!
[3/13/23, 5:27:30 AM] Gary Teh: And the people of Argentina stands with us

I would be really curious to see how actual situation on the ground is like when I pass through Brazil, Columbia, El Salvador and perhaps Venezuela 

A few of countries known to actively accept Bitcoin for purchases of goods and services
[3/13/23, 5:32:15 AM] Gary Teh: Venezuela will be particularly interesting, if I do get my visa. Their economy is almost entirely crippled thanks to ongoing U.S. sanctions

[3/13/23, 11:08:37 AM] Gary Teh: It reminds me of the series of conversations I have been having with @5491125130580 these past few weeks who engages in psychoanalysis for his clients. The meta-pattern that he helps his patients undergo is very similar too.

He works with his patients by providing the framework and his patients in collaboration with him define that version of the future that they desire and then at some point they make the mental leap and transition
[3/13/23, 11:12:07 AM] Peter Peng: Sure if it makes sense to whoever the more power to them
[3/13/23, 11:13:05 AM] Peter Peng: And it may very well make sense to Ken because you help him with Offchain

The premise of the contributions I am planning to make during the discussions will mainly revolve around the two paradoxes of AI. 

- Polyani’s Paradox
- Moravec’s Paradox

And stemming from them, speculations of what will and will not be impacted by the large scale deployment of AI models across our society

from an economic stand point, I would like to bring up for discussion the extreme deflationary and monopolistic effects of AI when layered on top our current automation platforms due to the kinds of winner takes all network effects dynamics often baked into current accompanying business models. 

One of my main concerns is that if not managed properly we will accidentally tip society from the liberal democracies we see around us into Feudalistic systems governed by the minority who will owns the AIs and automation platforms everyone is relying on
[3/14/23, 5:43:08 AM] Peter Peng: Haha classic movie

[3/14/23, 6:55:11 AM] Gary Teh: We have gained enough clarity for our landing pages initiative to move forward with the next steps. 🤩

[3/14/23, 7:02:03 AM] Peter Peng: You need to get the $5k for liquidity pool, let me know if you need help
[3/14/23, 7:02:49 AM] Peter Peng: The crypto markets are going up so you should try and get on an exchange
[3/14/23, 7:03:27 AM] Peter Peng: Need help speaking with Daoversal
[3/14/23, 7:07:21 AM] Peter Peng: That’s just what I would do
[3/14/23, 7:07:29 AM] Peter Peng: But it’s your DAO
[3/14/23, 7:08:18 AM] Gary Teh: Trying to figure out where to get some TRX tokens now. the 5000USDT is sitting in this TRON wallet. 

https://tronscan.org/#/address/TCjSAxGbWWTw4wAoHsNhLn1acvjqK2mgR7

Need to send some TRX tokens to that wallet before I can go ahead with the transaction of sending the USDT5000 to my account in Gate.IO

Once that is done, cross chain the USDT5000 to the Solana chain and then transfer our vault on Realms
[3/14/23, 7:09:21 AM] Peter Peng: Sounds like a scam, why do you need to send money to that wallet?
[3/14/23, 7:10:01 AM] Peter Peng: I worked with the FBI on an advanced fee fraud case in Thailand and China
[3/14/23, 7:10:17 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe this is a crypto version?
[3/14/23, 7:10:35 AM] Peter Peng: Just be careful before sending any money
[3/14/23, 7:12:12 AM] Gary Teh: I control that wallet dude. You need to pay gas fee for transactions to happen
[3/14/23, 7:12:44 AM] Gary Teh: Its like it you try to perform transaction on your solana wallet and your wallet does not contain any SOL. No money to pay gas fee = no transaction
[3/14/23, 7:23:32 AM] Peter Peng: Oh
[3/14/23, 7:23:59 AM] Peter Peng: But I thought you had $5k on it?
[3/14/23, 7:26:16 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/14/23, 7:26:22 AM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/14/23, 7:27:57 AM] Peter Peng: $0.000005 whenever you make a transaction (tron)
[3/14/23, 7:29:36 AM] Gary Teh: The 5K is USDT. 
You need it in TRX on the wallet before you can use it to pay for gas fees.
To convert USDT to TRX, you still need TRX for gas fees. 

I am transferring some USDT from my personal coinbase account now to my Huobi account now via the Ethereum chain. 

Once the USDT goes through, I will exchange the USDT to TRX the Huobi exchange
Then I will transfer the TRX i bought on Huobi exchange to the Tron Wallet I am controlling

With that to pay for gas fees, I will transfer the 5000USDT to my personal Gate.IO account

Then from there I will do the cross chain to transfer the 5000USDT to our Realms vault on Solana

Welcome to the rabbit hole
[3/14/23, 7:30:36 AM] Gary Teh: Right now, I am waiting for the USD29 from Coinbase to Huobi to go through. The Ethereum is so slow.
[3/14/23, 7:31:42 AM] Peter Peng: It is what it is
[3/14/23, 7:32:42 AM] Gary Teh: Transaction being processed
https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf4c4a97a93b2434f1375f0f14749bd8ebf6bed3#tokentxns
[3/14/23, 7:33:07 AM] Gary Teh: This fee I am paying on behalf of the DAO will be notarized in exchange for TDG governance tokens
[3/14/23, 7:33:34 AM] Peter Peng: Or can come out of the $5k
‎[3/14/23, 7:34:25 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:34:28 AM] Peter Peng: So you don’t lose money on you $1 USD = 1 TDG conversion
[3/14/23, 7:35:26 AM] Peter Peng: Or issue yourself TDG at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:35:39 AM] Peter Peng: Which I believe is the real exchange rate
[3/14/23, 7:37:51 AM] Gary Teh: As mentioned. Nope. We all agree to contribute based on the assumption that 1TDG = 1USD.

Anyone that wants to cash out immediately once the liquidity pool is setup can do so but at the discounted rate of $0.00333
‎[3/14/23, 7:38:37 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:39:05 AM] Peter Peng: I think it will be tough for people to buy at $1
[3/14/23, 7:39:14 AM] Peter Peng: But that’s just me
[3/14/23, 7:39:16 AM] Gary Teh: They should not.
[3/14/23, 7:39:28 AM] Gary Teh: Its sweat equity.
[3/14/23, 7:39:33 AM] Peter Peng: What price will they be buying at?
[3/14/23, 7:39:46 AM] Peter Peng: Oh so the tokens aren’t for sale?
[3/14/23, 7:40:00 AM] Gary Teh: From what I forsee, the DAO will be buying back at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:40:13 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : Great Gary ⚡
[3/14/23, 7:41:11 AM] Gary Teh: Market determines the price. 

But DAO will for sure buy back from any willing sellers at $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:41:12 AM] Peter Peng: You would need to define “early”
[3/14/23, 7:41:30 AM] Gary Teh: What do you mean by that?
[3/14/23, 7:41:31 AM] Peter Peng: Maybe that’s the unclear part
[3/14/23, 7:41:41 AM] Peter Peng: What cashing out early means
[3/14/23, 7:41:49 AM] Peter Peng: What the date is
[3/14/23, 7:43:06 AM] Gary Teh: I see what you mean. 
Early means you want to cash out before there is more USDT in the vault than TDG issued out.
[3/14/23, 7:43:22 AM] Gary Teh: The exact timing depends on the execution of various projects
[3/14/23, 7:43:42 AM] Peter Peng: Hmmm that will be tough
[3/14/23, 7:44:11 AM] Gary Teh: That is why I saw being involved in this DAO is not for everybody.
‎[3/14/23, 7:44:26 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:44:30 AM] Gary Teh: Buying some TRX tokens now
[3/14/23, 7:44:35 AM] Peter Peng: Tough for investors
[3/14/23, 7:45:14 AM] Peter Peng: Since you’ve issued out 1.5 million TDG already for the $5k
[3/14/23, 7:45:27 AM] Peter Peng: You need to sell tokens
[3/14/23, 7:45:54 AM] Peter Peng: Or else it just looks like a “slave labor” model for the DAO
[3/14/23, 7:46:23 AM] Peter Peng: This is just an outside perspective
[3/14/23, 7:46:34 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not sure how sustainable it is
[3/14/23, 7:46:37 AM] Gary Teh: The 1.5 miillion TDG was not issued out for the $5K 
It was for all the efforts that have already been sunk into the ecosystem so far
[3/14/23, 7:47:24 AM] Peter Peng: Right, but if everyone was to cash out all at once the value of the DAO would drop significantly
[3/14/23, 7:47:34 AM] Peter Peng: Even at the $0.00333
[3/14/23, 7:47:47 AM] Peter Peng: Penalty
‎[3/14/23, 7:47:50 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:48:36 AM] Peter Peng: You see what I’m saying? Your 1 TDG = $1 USD would become depegged
[3/14/23, 7:49:59 AM] Brian -IOM: Peter I told you already: 1TDG = 1TDG 😂🙌
[3/14/23, 7:50:38 AM] Peter Peng: I keep forgetting 😅 …
[3/14/23, 7:51:35 AM] Peter Peng: Just trying to help lol
‎[3/14/23, 7:56:33 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 7:58:46 AM] Peter Peng: So 1 TDG = $0.003 USD right?
[3/14/23, 7:58:50 AM] Gary Teh: I totally get your point of view. 

So long as there continues to be insane people like me willing to continue contributing to the DAO by valuing each 1TDG at 1USD, the dynamic will still continue to hold

Folks that have lost faith and want nothing to do with the whole insanity can just cash out their outstanding TDG holdings at the prevailing $0.00333, while the rest of insane horde can continue. 🤣
[3/14/23, 7:59:15 AM] Peter Peng: So 1 TDG = 1 TDG = $0.003 USD right?
[3/14/23, 8:00:03 AM] Brian -IOM: I don't have a dog - or indeed a Doge - in this fight. I'm just along for the ride! 🐶
[3/14/23, 8:00:22 AM] Peter Peng: Lol so you are saying you want $1 billion worth of sweat equity?
[3/14/23, 8:01:00 AM] Peter Peng: Before the price of the coin goes up
[3/14/23, 8:01:19 AM] Peter Peng: Not sustainable
[3/14/23, 8:01:58 AM] Peter Peng: You are not some god-king 😂

[3/14/23, 8:06:03 AM] Peter Peng: I think you should keep half for your expenses

[3/14/23, 8:23:09 AM] Peter Peng: Insane
[3/14/23, 8:23:20 AM] Gary Teh: So be it. As @6598383264 always says, to be pioneer to live and die by your decisions. 🤣
[3/14/23, 8:23:48 AM] Peter Peng: Hahaha
[3/14/23, 8:23:49 AM] Gary Teh: Today, it is worth 1.5million USD
[3/14/23, 8:24:10 AM] Peter Peng: You have 1 billion TDG
[3/14/23, 8:24:25 AM] Peter Peng: You’ve only issued 1.5 million
[3/14/23, 8:25:03 AM] Peter Peng: So you are total valuing the company 1 billion… do you see my perspective?
[3/14/23, 8:25:51 AM] Gary Teh: Hmmmm... Not sure if you have realized by now.  You are talking to a generally insane person.

Someone who bought a one way ticket into ground zero Rome during the pandemic to verify that pandemic is actually happening.

And who actually got thrown into jail in China for investigating the Uighur oppression issue 

https://www.ricemedia.co/features-the-singaporean-arrested-in-xinjiang/ 🤣
[3/14/23, 8:26:46 AM] Peter Peng: Lol okay but still doesn’t make for a good investment
[3/14/23, 8:27:06 AM] Gary Teh: Doesn't matter. We don't need your cash.

[3/14/23, 8:34:33 AM] Gary Teh: I suddenly recall something that @5511982667030 mentioned last year during one of our meetings 

Go all in, if a project is meant to fail fail thoroughly, make sure there are no stones left turned so that there are no regrets later on. 🤣
‎[3/14/23, 8:36:52 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 8:38:03 AM] Gary Teh: One important thing that came out from this mornings meeting with @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @381644913030 is that future governance token grants to finance projects in our DAO from our vault will have a formal approval process. 

Exact details are being right now worked out
[3/14/23, 8:39:00 AM] Gary Teh: Each project will be tied to specific KPIs 

at the project levels, formal roles with well defined tasks and governance token renumeration will be defined.
[3/14/23, 8:44:02 AM] Peter Peng: So you will be using the $5k to fund projects?
[3/14/23, 8:44:56 AM] Gary Teh: 🤷‍♂️

The DAO decides through voting
[3/14/23, 8:46:35 AM] Peter Peng: I would propose using that capital to find projects / cryptocurrency to invest in
[3/14/23, 8:47:12 AM] Peter Peng: Even putting it into BTC right now
[3/14/23, 8:48:01 AM] Peter Peng: as long as you have liquidity
[3/14/23, 8:48:40 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to submit a proposal for voting 🙂👍🏻

[3/14/23, 10:28:02 AM] Gary Teh: Insightful video on the stress that’s been going on since last Wednesday in Silicon Valley 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jasoncalacanis_founders-bankrun-siliconvalleybank-activity-7041428747727626240-3DoU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios
[3/14/23, 10:38:25 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that came out crystal clear during this morning's discussion is that the attention span of members are limited. 

Rather than sharing this limited attention of our community on projects that nothing at all to do with the furthering of our governance token's utility and value, we will opt instead to focus attention bandwidth to projects that have direct associations with our governance tokens.
[3/14/23, 10:41:08 AM] Gary Teh: Folks who want to continue sharing their projects can feel free to do so in the Do Nothing society.
[3/14/23, 10:41:32 AM] Gary Teh: https://truesight.me/do-nothing
[3/14/23, 10:43:06 AM] Peter Peng: Nothingness further validates my claim that each TDG token is only worth $0.00333 at the moment
[3/14/23, 10:43:42 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
‎[3/14/23, 10:46:54 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/14/23, 10:50:54 AM] Gary Teh: Yes!

It is definitely going to be worth even less next month when valued based on the cash to token issued ratio when taking into account the expected volume of token issues in exchange for member contributions. 🤩

If I were you, I would probably cash out immediately as soon as the liquidity pool is setup and then have nothing more to do with this insane group of people 🤣
[3/14/23, 10:55:45 AM] Peter Peng: I would need to cash out at the $1
[3/14/23, 10:56:02 AM] Peter Peng: Valuation
[3/14/23, 10:56:23 AM] Peter Peng: Which you raise sweat equity on
[3/14/23, 10:56:39 AM] Peter Peng: Why cash out at a loss?
[3/14/23, 10:57:26 AM] Peter Peng: When does that happen?
[3/14/23, 11:01:24 AM] Gary Teh: No idea dude. Might happen faster if you pour more sweat equity into the projects 🤣
[3/14/23, 11:08:48 AM] Peter Peng: Or be awarded more tokens to equate for the difference
[3/14/23, 11:09:36 AM] Gary Teh: That would be against our rubric 🙂
[3/14/23, 11:09:44 AM] Peter Peng: (In actuality I don’t care about the money or tokens) this is just the money game to me
[3/14/23, 11:10:00 AM] Peter Peng: 😂😂😂
[3/14/23, 11:10:23 AM] Peter Peng: Think of it as sparring practice
[3/14/23, 11:11:02 AM] Peter Peng: For real investors
[3/14/23, 11:11:42 AM] Gary Teh: Actually these are good points you raised 🙂👍

And will definitely be helpful as we draft up the onboarding documents that @918017107841 @5491125130580 and myself are right now focused on
[3/14/23, 11:12:01 AM] Peter Peng: I just want to see you succeed
[3/14/23, 11:12:49 AM] Peter Peng: Plus I might want to buy some coins
[3/14/23, 11:13:10 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t care about the tokens earned via sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:13:14 AM] Gary Teh: I am glad you are with us on our journey 🤩
[3/14/23, 11:13:55 AM] Gary Teh: Should be coming soon

Once the market gets listed on Dexlab

Haven’t heard anything from them still 

Will follow up sometime this week or next
[3/14/23, 11:14:35 AM] Peter Peng: Just consider the how you price the tokens
[3/14/23, 11:15:19 AM] Peter Peng: Better to give more tokens for the sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:15:40 AM] Peter Peng: So the investors want to invest
[3/14/23, 11:16:44 AM] Peter Peng: You have 1 billion
[3/14/23, 11:17:21 AM] Peter Peng: Who care if you allocate all 1 billion, the price of the token will rise for all
[3/14/23, 11:17:52 AM] Peter Peng: More people will want to provide the sweat equity lol
[3/14/23, 11:27:32 AM] Peter Peng: Let’s just say this, you are more likely to raise $1 billion cash than to raise $1 billion in sweat equity
[3/14/23, 11:42:48 AM] Gary Teh: Actually after reading through the Raydium protocol what might be interesting is for people to earn TDG governance tokens for staking their LP tokens (tokens you get from Raydium after staking USDT/TDG pairs in the liquidity pool)

That serves to lock up liquidity and renumerate liquidity providers in the ecosystem
[3/14/23, 12:15:45 PM] Peter Peng: Yes which is why it needs one price and conversion rate
[3/14/23, 12:16:33 PM] Peter Peng: At some point the sweat equity stops
[3/14/23, 12:17:29 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding future revenues earned from successful projects within our DAO, @381644913030 has suggested that 10-25% of the revenue to channeled into the liquidity pools to back the value of the tokens

I think we should even a step further by burning the LP tokens issued. That way the liquidity generated via those sources gets forever locked into the pool
[3/14/23, 12:18:57 PM] Peter Peng: Not sure I agree just yet with the second paragraph… need to think on it
[3/14/23, 12:19:54 PM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: That is the end goal?
[3/14/23, 12:20:00 PM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: What?
[3/14/23, 12:21:36 PM] Gary Teh: A self balancing, self perpetuating and self governing ecosystem that builds a better world based on verified truth 

One that adheres to the values of Autonomy, integrity and diversity 

The vision in the form of an ecosystem of projects
[3/14/23, 12:21:43 PM] Gary Teh: That is TrueSight DAO
[3/14/23, 12:22:36 PM] Peter Peng: Burning tokens just increases the value
[3/14/23, 12:24:58 PM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: Each other is a business that generates profit in fiat or just in crypto?
[3/14/23, 12:25:12 PM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: Other=project
[3/14/23, 12:28:33 PM] Gary Teh: Profits are generated in fiat
[3/14/23, 12:35:40 PM] Gary Teh: Much much Later on when Web3 Ui/UX has been fixed, we will start charging services rendered by our projects directly in crypto 

But right now, it’s too early
[3/14/23, 12:38:36 PM] Juan Bernabó Bernabó: Our vision of ♾️labs has to do with catalizing the transformation to the ♾️economy by catalizing and developing ecosystemic businesses that can turn disruption waves and big challenges into huge business opportunities for networks of thousands of smb and millions of people, also have this ideia of a self perpetuating and self governing ecosystem but not at the beginning as the visioning, boostraping and structuring I don't really know how to make that happens with a distributed organization, a lot of DAOs start centralized for that reason and after they have the core running they open up for the community and shift the governance to them... It's a great research subject to understand, boostraping DAOs...
[3/14/23, 12:42:14 PM] Gary Teh: And that is part of the RnD we are doing within this ecosystem

[3/14/23, 2:11:58 PM] Gary Teh: I believe it is possible to create a world where we could make good decisions using information that had been verified to be true 

And there are various kinds of good important decisions we need to make. 

Thus the need for various projects to tackle these various kinds of decision

And when we have done what we have set out to do we would have built a better world based on verifiable truth

And in the process we would have setup the proper foundation to safeguard the autonomy of individuals, through systems with integrity to preserve our diverse ecosystem
[3/14/23, 2:15:47 PM] Gary Teh: Personally for me, I know my daughter is going to grow up to become a very strong headed person. 

So better work hard to setup the foundation to safeguard our autonomy in that future world so that she does not need to expend so much effort to do so when the time comes for her to take the helm in the future. 

And when the time finally comes for me to pass over to the next incarnation I will be able to Rest In Peace knowing I have done everything I could during this incarnation 🙏
[3/14/23, 2:22:14 PM] Aléksa: just sent the request, did you get it?

[3/14/23, 2:25:22 PM] Gary Teh: Once you have come to terms with your mortality, the next thing that comes to mind is your legacy 🙂

[3/14/23, 10:06:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: i just caught up with what @14153000019 and @14075792560 was discussing about token valuation. 

Actually early on last year 2022 around Apr May? I made the very same observation as @14075792560. So we do think alike in certain ways. As I made the same observation. I agree with what Peter said 100%

@14153000019 bro I have tried to explain to you when you approach investors, the very first obstacle you will receive is. “Why is there already 1.5M TDG issued” “why should I pay x amount for only x TDG.” 

I said also as an investor I will examine your rubic and view it as a constant dilution source. And if x number of years created x amount of TDG. How much revenue has been created? From there I will understand the capital management of the Dao and see if it’s a good or bad company. 

Your rubic needs a serious rework. I have objected to and will continue to object to useless dilutions such as giving out tokens for simple comments like this one I am making. 

Although in the rubic I am making critical governance input. Hence tokens must be credited to me now. 

However I do acknowledge that Dao members need to be credited for any contributions, thought and comment and time spent to say or do anything for the Dao. 

As a result, you got to manage the token issue amounts with careful result oriented balancing. (Sort of game balancing mechanics that results in fair play)

The second option is make money faster than your issue rate in order to appeal to investors. 

Otherwise whatever @14075792560 and my grilling on the token issues will be the tip of the iceberg compared to what investors have to ask.
[3/14/23, 10:19:07 PM] Gary Teh: Good point. 
Nascent business models all very high failures. We have so far tested and slaughtered around 5 business models which we know to have failed. 

As the amount of business models tested fails, the amount of dilution will naturally increase. 

This is true not just for DAOs. It is exactly the same phenomena observed in traditional tech startups. The exception is dilution is more apparent in DAOs as compared to traditional startups where effects of dilution is often opaque and visible only to board members. 

Rubric wise, as I have also suggested before feel free to propose line item changes 

All DAO members have the right to do so. 

Also all DAO members have the right to vote on token issues. 

The burden does not just lie on the shoulder of one member. It just so happens that one member is more active in notarizing contributions 🙂

My hunch is the KPI based token issues method that @381644913030 @918017107841 and @5491125130580 suggested might help address the concern you raise about dilution
[3/14/23, 10:22:54 PM] Gary Teh: ultimately it just boils down to project success rates.
[3/14/23, 10:29:46 PM] Gary Teh: Investors will naturally be willing to pay a premium to buy into projects with a strong performance metrics

So far, none of our projects are really hitting those performance levels. 

If we can find use case that is so critical and user adoption growth rate is 100% month over month, then you don’t even need to bother pitching for investments, partners from Andressen Horowitz will just come knocking of their own accord
[3/14/23, 10:53:34 PM] Gary Teh: another approach I can think of to deal with the dilution issue is to use the same approach VC funds use

50% each round of fund typically gets deployed across 10 startups. With the remaining 50% deployed in follow on rounds of these initial startups if they are successfully hitting their numbers 

We have already tested and killed 5 business models so far. We cap it a maximum testing of another 5 business models. 

If even those 5 new ones fail, we will stop issuing more tokens from our vault for contribution efforts by members. This essential pulls the kill switch on the DAO. 🤔
[3/14/23, 11:37:56 PM] Peter Peng: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/15/23, 12:16:28 AM] Peter Peng: Why not invest the funds in projects that already have a token? Makes it easier to have liquidity, even if the project ultimately fails there are ways to make money (if you get in early enough) or if you time the investment correctly. The projects underneath the DAO don’t have tokens currently or plan on having a token sale.
[3/15/23, 12:17:07 AM] Peter Peng: The beauty of Web3 is that there is usually liquidity early.
[3/15/23, 12:17:42 AM] Peter Peng: This way you’ll always have funds to invest if your returns are good.
[3/15/23, 12:24:46 AM] Peter Peng: You could always use a percentage of the profits to invest in projects that do social good.
[3/15/23, 4:47:49 AM] Gary Teh: Having a token doesn’t mean it has a viable underlying business model
[3/15/23, 4:47:59 AM] Gary Teh: Those are two separate things

[3/15/23, 6:12:49 AM] Gary Teh: Tested and killed
========
Moonshot
Market Monocole
Cypher Defense, personally I am bearish on this after seeing the statistics
TrueSight.me 
Trinity

As for the rest ask @6594897484 and @16468233438. Those killed without testing  ideas were what inspired the Do Nothing society. 🤣

[3/15/23, 6:31:29 AM] Tres Garcia: 👆Some gold in here….. 
The project boils down to 2x questions. 
1. Where did the DAO come from? This is key to getting people excited about the platform and addresses Kelvin’s investor concerns. 
2. Where is the DAO going? 

Both should answer “Why” and allow the vision to take hold for builders, investors and users.
[3/15/23, 6:32:11 AM] Peter Peng: To date, most crypto VCs invest in crypto / web3 projects this way the funds stay “OnChain”
[3/15/23, 6:32:32 AM] Peter Peng: Which is why I asked
[3/15/23, 6:32:45 AM] Gary Teh: A lot of projects, I just simply ignored and don't bother to follow up are either those which comes with no business models or the founders been just really avoidant when it comes to providing performance statistics. Those to me are immediate red flags however smooth talking the person doing the pitching is.
[3/15/23, 6:33:16 AM] Garis Pang: Deutsche Bank will join in the party soon 🥳
[3/15/23, 6:34:34 AM] Gary Teh: One of the projects, I came across at the Binance event in Frankfurt was so well packaged but when you started analyzing its tokenomics, you start realizing it is going to fail. And when it does, it is going to collapse really really fast. One of their executive members just reached out recently again hoping for investor introductions.

I didn't even bother to follow up.
[3/15/23, 6:34:35 AM] Tres Garcia: Readers change Moody’s observations from “Insightful” to “No-s#*t! Sherlock!”
[3/15/23, 6:35:27 AM] Tres Garcia: Good one
[3/15/23, 6:37:07 AM] Gary Teh: Other times, the yield of the projects clearly does not meet the return requirements of investor profiles in the network. So those I don't even bother to forward over. 

Angels are less strict in their ROI needs compared to VCs which have a tougher requirement because of their LP expectations.

[3/19/23, 2:33:23 PM] Gary Teh: That is quite cheap. USD2billion??
[3/19/23, 2:35:12 PM] Iwona Fluda: Yes, it's nothing. Credit Suisse had apparently Total assets: 531.4 billion CHF (2022). 😂
[3/19/23, 2:36:48 PM] Gary Teh: That is awkward. So basically it’s a government engineered merger

USD531 billion sold for around USD2 billion?

What happens to the shareholders of credit suisse?
[3/19/23, 2:39:27 PM] Iwona Fluda: Most of the people would probably get laid off unfortunately. The rest is in the governmental hands. I see the headlines tomorrow morning saying how much the CH government is discussing to give to them.

[3/19/23, 2:42:01 PM] Iwona Fluda: Well, depending on the source, the number may vary. Nevertheless, 2 or almost 4 billion seems to be nothing.

[3/20/23, 2:13:17 PM] Gary Teh: You know the funny thing is quite a few of the banks that were involved in the meltdown somehow had significant exposure to cryptocurrency 

The fact that they are experiencing a meltdown while Bitcoin trends upwards feels like an oxymoron 

This is pretty much like how SVB collapse triggered the rebound of bond prices which was what triggered its bank run 🤔
[3/20/23, 2:14:42 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure as use of libraries like stable diffusion proliferates we will be expecting the proliferation of more and more of deepfake videos across the web
[3/20/23, 2:16:31 PM] Gary Teh: Part of the discussion we had last week between @5491125130580 @918017107841 and @381644913030 involved the setting up of oracles for prices from agricultural producers worldwide 

We will be having a follow up session tomorrow to further discuss this

For folks who are keen please to reach out to @918017107841 to get an invite to our online FaceTime session 🙂👍
[3/20/23, 2:17:42 PM] Aléksa: I will come with the first governance framework by end of the week

then would be great you review, give feedback, and we could also have a follow up call
[3/20/23, 2:18:26 PM] Gary Teh: Yes, that would be wonderful.  Thanks for doing so @381644913030 🙂🙏
[3/20/23, 2:23:50 PM] Gary Teh: Following up with Charmverse to checkout their solution 

I was wondering if anyone would be keen to craft up a video on how to use the proposal submission and voting features for Realms Solana?

I believe it would be great content to both share in this channel in exchange for governance tokens as well as share on your own LinkedIn feed to educate your followers who are keen to onboard into web3

I would happy to reshare the URL to your LinkedIn feed to the house of balance group too. There are increasing interest in that community for start adopting web3 solutions 🙂🙏

[3/20/23, 2:33:56 PM] Gary Teh: DexLabs has not reverted with the listing of our USDT/TDG market listing on their DEX

I have a whole bunch of stuff on my plate to be able to follow up on that for the next few weeks. 

If someone is keen to follow up on that in exchange for governance tokens that would be great. 

Once our USDT/TDG market is listed on the DexLabs DEX we can start voting on how many percent of our USDT reserves we should utilize for buy backs from members looking to exit some of their holdings 🙂🙏
[3/20/23, 2:40:05 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/20/23, 2:40:56 PM] Gary Teh: Will spend sometime next week to look through the subscription revenue that Edgar generated over the past year when we trialed run doing direct sales of our market sell off reports before that direct sales initiative got aborted at the suggestion of @16468233438 when he proposed to replace it with a more scalable way of generating sales. 

Unfortunately that latter approach suggested by him failed with 0% conversion rate. 🤔

My hunch is the total amount of USDT in reserves should get bumped up by another USDT1000+. Will keep you all posted on the progress of that audit 🙂👍

Off the top of my head I recall we probably still have a few active subscribers for that service
[3/20/23, 2:44:04 PM] Gary Teh: So based on the rough math, the cash to issued token ratio should be approximately USD0.004 right now 

That is an appreciate bump of 20% over the past week 🤣
[3/20/23, 3:00:14 PM] Gary Teh: One thing has also became very clear during the discussions we have been having over the past few weeks. 

DAO member status is only had if an individual is in possession of our governance tokens because of prior contributions 

Being active in our chatroom discussions does not confer that status, it only makes an individual an observer of our DAO if his/her governance token holdings are Zero 🙂
[3/20/23, 8:05:34 PM] Gary Teh: Statements made in our chatrooms by various participants in no way represent the stance of the entire DAO.

The stance of the DAO is made apparent through its voting activities 

and for the formal voting process we are using the realms solution 

https://TrueSight.me/vault

The less formal route is via the polling feature of WhatsApp

Rather awkward that it doesn’t have any traction 🤔
[3/21/23, 5:36:51 AM] Brian -IOM: Perhaps ahead of the curve - just wait and do nothing!
[3/21/23, 5:43:45 AM] Gary Teh: True. Based on historical track record, I would even say we should expect to be doing nothing for around two years and then suddenly this use case becomes urgent 🤣
[3/21/23, 7:20:13 AM] Gary Teh: When I was trying to setup my technology consulting firm back in Singapore, 2 years of nothing before clients started pouring in

When I was trying to get into the events/publicity industry, 3 years of nothing before gigs started pouring in

When I started messing around with jazz, 2 years later it became mainstream

When I started building GetData.IO, 5 years before the passive income revenue stream started coming alive

When I started experimenting with the vertical farmings in urban setting, 2 years later it became a primary initiative in Singapore

When I started experimenting with DAOs, a year later it became a thing. 

When I moved from Singapore to Silicon Valley, 2 years later flow of talent in this direction became the norm

When I decided to move into my car during the pandemic, 1 year later the off the grid trend became mainstream.

These are the data points I have gathered so far

[3/21/23, 5:26:18 PM] Gary Teh: This is the start of the category of problem I have just described 

Now there is really no way of knowing the truth about anything anymore unless you actually go to the place yourself to investigate it
[3/21/23, 5:26:54 PM] Gary Teh: However since most of the population have neither the resources nor the time to do so, doesn’t figuratively throw us back into the dark ages??
[3/21/23, 5:28:02 PM] Brian -IOM: Totally - although I think that’s been the case for a while in terms of living in a reality distortion field. At least since covid - but probably significantly longer.
[3/21/23, 5:28:29 PM] Brian -IOM: Now it is unavoidably self evident!
[3/21/23, 5:29:02 PM] Gary Teh: Even right now, what I am observing being reported about trump seems to be a smearing campaign on the level that Richard Nixon experienced during the phase before he was trying to get elected to become president
[3/21/23, 5:30:37 PM] Brian -IOM: You have a short memory - he was relentlessly smeared before he was even inaugurated. What about the dossier paid for by HRC?
[3/21/23, 5:31:03 PM] Brian -IOM: Everything is fake and has been for ages - we just woke up to it!
[3/21/23, 5:51:28 PM] Tres Garcia: That’s how you know it’s fake news!
[3/21/23, 6:04:36 PM] Brian -IOM: For real! 😂
[3/21/23, 6:09:24 PM] Peter Peng: My question is… isn’t he supposed to be arrested in real life today?
[3/21/23, 6:11:22 PM] Gary Teh: Good question 

The charges is stupid. Being charged Hush money for a porn star to not talk about their affair during his campaigning season. 🤔

It feels more like something for the gossip column of the tabloids than something to be treated seriously. For example accepting bribes from Russia 🤦‍♂️
[3/21/23, 6:12:30 PM] Peter Peng: I don’t think anyone takes the government seriously anymore lol
[3/21/23, 6:14:20 PM] Dan: Metaverse today, irl tomorrow
[3/21/23, 6:14:34 PM] Gary Teh: Managed to gain more insight this evening by the pool on the inflation issue in Argentina 

It’s mainly the problem of having a communist inclined government in place that has no economic sense 🤔
[3/21/23, 6:16:58 PM] Brian -IOM: I guess that means that within 90 days the USA is, erm… a communist government that has no economic sense. 😛
[3/21/23, 6:19:45 PM] Gary Teh: How come??
[3/21/23, 6:21:37 PM] Brian -IOM: I believe the term is hyperbitcoinisation 😉
[3/21/23, 6:23:15 PM] Fatima: Be careful with the word “communist”… The actual party in power in Argentina is left wing, not communist.

You will see what is a communist party in Venezuela 🇻🇪
[3/21/23, 6:36:37 PM] Peter Peng: The US government created Bitcoin
[3/21/23, 6:37:05 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! 🤩👍

Will be fascinating to see how their entire system works when I am there
[3/21/23, 10:22:17 PM] Gary Teh: The gates foundation just released a publication on AI, the primary areas of impact are education and health care

I thought folks interested operating in these areas might find it useful

[3/22/23, 11:46:51 AM] Garis Pang: Towards scheduled of 6% by end of the year
[3/22/23, 11:47:33 AM] Brian -IOM: Increased rates with stealth QE - the worst of both worlds! 😅
[3/22/23, 11:49:10 AM] Tres Garcia: So…. Powell is Satoshi?! 🧐
[3/22/23, 11:49:27 AM] Tres Garcia: The conspiracy = solved!

[3/22/23, 3:52:26 PM] Gary Teh: @2348123243309 once again thanks for organizing the AI summit. It was an assembly of some really bright minds on the subject! 

For folks who are keen, I took some notes on some of the topics that were raised for discussions here
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20230322%20-%20topics%20surfaced%20during%20Ai%20summit
[3/22/23, 3:58:38 PM] Gary Teh: These were the main topics I surfaced during the start of our session

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11-OpgtKJDHKiYnXIyiL_8JOuDrSMqFu8VxudtYPafaU/edit
[3/22/23, 5:32:40 PM] Peter Peng: Maybe we already understand that the truth is here… truth is “Everything is a lie”.
[3/22/23, 6:00:01 PM] Gary Teh: Not true that are two classes of lies and two classes of truth
[3/22/23, 6:01:51 PM] Gary Teh: Class 1 lie: the kind you tell yourself

Class 2 lie: the kinds that Society tells you

Class 1 truth: universally true and repeatable. Large masses like Earth have gravity 

Class 2 truths: the sun rose this morning in the East on earth 


The goal of building a better world based on verifiable truth is to help humanity decipher between these 4 classes
[3/22/23, 6:28:10 PM] Peter Peng: Pluto also “used” to be a planet and Einstein’s “theory of relativity” has also been disproven so science isn’t necessarily 100%

The reality is that truths can turn into lies and lies can turn into truths over time.
[3/22/23, 6:28:40 PM] Peter Peng: Change is the only thing that’s constant.
[3/22/23, 6:45:24 PM] Gary Teh: Class 2 truth: @14075792560 has made a statement 🤔
[3/22/23, 6:45:41 PM] Gary Teh: That is DAO ☯️
[3/22/23, 6:46:51 PM] Peter Peng: There are so many unseen forces

[3/22/23, 6:49:49 PM] Peter Peng: I had a tough time reading it because it was blurry
[3/22/23, 6:50:07 PM] Peter Peng: 😂, but I guess it made it more mysterious
[3/22/23, 6:51:55 PM] Gary Teh: Go do google search for verse 1 of dao de Jing
[3/23/23, 3:09:56 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: I was actually unstable during your session

From the look of things, your session was mindblowing

I listened to the Recorded version of your session this morning 

And I had sent a copy to you on TG

Can I send it here?
[3/23/23, 5:27:37 AM] Gary Teh: Yes please 🙂👍
[3/23/23, 5:37:37 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Eventually, the file is large. Can't be sent to Whatsapp.

Though, it's right in your DM on telegram 🙏🏼
[3/23/23, 5:49:54 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! I will have it downloaded and then archived in our DAO data repository on GitHub

[3/23/23, 6:14:05 AM] Gary Teh: And somehow their prices seem to be trading at almost the same price 🤔
[3/23/23, 6:36:39 AM] Johnson Teh: Crypto is NOT even an asset as of now, it has a long way to go, but in the event if it made it then the upside will be hugh, but not without risk 

For these who believe in self sabotaging themselves or will rather drag half the world into poverty just so to have a random chance of resetting the balance for everyone (more for themselves) crypto might be a good punt. But for the majority rich and not so poor, crypto represents a riskier alternative, which is why I don’t touch crypto at all (of cos I am happy to use it as an alternative tools to raise fund (which always ended up as USD
[3/23/23, 6:37:57 AM] Ozioma Chukwunyere: Fantastic!
‎[3/23/23, 7:25:44 AM] Peter Peng: ‎image omitted
[3/23/23, 8:03:41 AM] Garis Pang: BUY it now at the great discount!!! 👍
[3/23/23, 8:18:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: My opinion is. Whoever thinks crypto (not government owned) will take over the world is absolutely foolish.

BTC will eventually become zero if it rises in popularity. (But that doesn’t mean I am not making money out of it in the short term)

Crypto if replaces the common currency is a Direct challenge to a country’s fiscal power. 

How will the country print money anymore? Or buy unlimited bonds. Or bail banks out. When the crypto unless theirs, cannot be created without the governors consensus. 

Countries who have even tried to challenge the USD have gotten bombed. Don’t get me started on the petrodollar. 

So nope. Unless it’s a government owned crypto which results back to square one = fiat.  Crypto is doomed. 

Best case is to stay within the shadows. Just enough for the rich people to gamble and play and rob each other. 

But not mass adopted enough to challenge the government currency
[3/23/23, 8:22:05 AM] Peter Peng: With the power of AI combined with blockchain, it can certainly dissolve current governments today. Governments will eventually turn into how monarchies are today.
[3/23/23, 8:23:17 AM] Peter Peng: We almost need to listen to the AI, because when “people rule people” this is when inhumane things happens and power corrupts absolutely.
[3/23/23, 8:23:29 AM] Peter Peng: AI will be the new government
[3/23/23, 8:27:53 AM] Peter Peng: With its own currency on the blockchain for automation through smart contract
[3/23/23, 8:43:39 AM] Peter Peng: I’m not saying any system is perfect but it may prove to be better long term as we globalize
[3/23/23, 11:29:07 AM] Gary Teh: No system is perfect. 

Bitcoin doesn’t have to replace fiat. It feels like just another commodity

I don’t see governments going all out to destroy the silver or timber supply out there 🤔
[3/23/23, 11:31:20 AM] Peter Peng: They should leave crypto alone this way they can print less money
[3/23/23, 11:42:06 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[3/23/23, 11:43:32 AM] Gary Teh: I love the new governance framework that @381644913030 just completed drafting and shared with the governors! 

The governors are right now looking through it, we will be calling for a governors meeting two weeks from now to discuss how to roll it out

Non-governors will be welcomed to join but only allowed to sit in as observers to the discussions

From my perspective the governance framework is so beautiful, I will only be investing time, money and resources to all future projects via TrueSight DAO in the future. 

Thanks for the wonderful undertaking @381644913030!! 🤩
[3/23/23, 3:09:19 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 I just finished chatting with @16504369509 

They are in the process of setting up a DAO to further scale their efforts at building housing for homeless in Oakland 

One of the ideas that came out of the discussion is creating a legal wrapper to allow high income individuals in the Bay Area to donate to in return for tax returns

I wonder if you are familiar with the jurisdiction in that area or know some one from the legal web3 community that is familiar 

@13104674556 I am aware that you are into promoting smart cities and you are based in Berkeley. I wonder if you might have insights about this that might be helpful for @16504369509 🙂🙏

@14152032783  @16504369509  will be reaching out soon to explore local government grants which can help with this initiative 🙂🙏

[3/23/23, 3:25:22 PM] Gary Teh: @16504369509  🙂
[3/23/23, 3:36:58 PM] Dan: Hi! Super fresh, so no website quite yet. We’re building a transitional housing community in the Bay Area that contains 10 tiny homes, medical structure, computer lab, urban farming, dignified bathrooms/showers, and onsite laundry. The residents served will be ages 25-40 and will be nominated + interviewed to identify their commitment to self improvement and a willingness to take steps towards permanent housing. Resources for workforce development, mental health, housing navigation, and recovery will be available within the community. The goal is with stable housing and access to those tools they’ll find permanent sustainable housing by the end of a year.
[3/23/23, 3:37:47 PM] Aléksa: Awesome idea
[3/23/23, 3:38:48 PM] Peter Peng: That’s great 😃
[3/23/23, 3:50:10 PM] Dan: Thanks! I cofounded a project that has built 14 emergency tiny homes since the start of Covid with an unsustainable model solely reliant on volunteer organizers and builders. The model above is being formed as a DAO where we have starting funding. Looking into ways to create a wrapper for the DAO to be able to accept donations that are tax deductible. Curious how that would possibly work for grants as well
[3/23/23, 4:10:57 PM] Aléksa: It is, many projects in the space have that set up

[3/26/23, 4:22:22 PM] Peter Peng: If I’m not mistaken, it’s Russia (Putin) that’s the one bombing?…
[3/26/23, 7:11:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: Everyone is bombing someone. EXCEPT China who hasn’t bombed anyone since 1991. 

Minus Taiwan bombardment which is technically “China’s state” as recognised by NATO and USA by the ONE CHINA policy.
[3/26/23, 7:12:46 PM] Kelvin Chew: Which I found it funny. Either u have the balls to say “One China” is rubbish and tell China to fuck off. 

Or u accept one China and ignore whatever China wants to do to its own states. 

Because if there is an uprising in let’s say Texas. No other country should have a say as to what USA wants to do to that uprising state. It’s American business
[3/26/23, 7:15:01 PM] Kelvin Chew: So by recognising the One China which america constantly says it does, US really have no right to any of Taiwan’s problems. And has no right to supply arms or make official visits. 

It’s a direct conflict to the One China which usa claims it upholds.
[3/26/23, 7:16:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: In doing so, america is rendering all diplomatic promises and treaties pointless. So the word of usa becomes worthless.
[3/26/23, 7:18:57 PM] Peter Peng: Yeah but it’s similar to the Annexation of Crimea and now look at the Russian war with Ukraine.
[3/26/23, 7:19:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: So do it correctly. Say One China is dissolved. The world doesn’t recognise it. And let the games begin. 

Do you know internationally. For airlines. When they list Taipei as a destination. They aren’t allowed to list it as 

“Taipei, Taiwan”

Only as

“Taipei”

Or 

“taipei, China”
[3/26/23, 7:19:40 PM] Peter Peng: So to prevent more war the US needs to be involved
[3/26/23, 7:20:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not the same. Because Taiwan is a break away state
[3/26/23, 7:20:13 PM] Peter Peng: “One China is Dissolved”
[3/26/23, 7:20:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: Not a independent country that got invaded
[3/26/23, 7:20:36 PM] Kelvin Chew: Wrong. Us creates war
[3/26/23, 7:20:38 PM] Kelvin Chew: Lol

[3/27/23, 6:35:12 AM] Gary Teh: I am keen to observe US stance towards Taiwan once the Taiwanese semi conductor plant comes online in Arizona next year. 

Also when I was there in Taiwan back in 2020, it was super apparent the southern Taiwanese (the industrialists) are all for reunification with Taiwan while the northern Taiwanese (folks bought into liberal democracy ideology) are against it
[3/27/23, 6:40:55 AM] Peter Peng: I think they’ll be more bullish on Taiwan maintaining its independence
[3/27/23, 6:48:38 AM] Kelvin Chew: Ur analysis is incomplete bro
[3/27/23, 6:49:05 AM] Kelvin Chew: TSMC is building their 5nm chip in the new factory in usa
[3/27/23, 6:49:21 AM] Kelvin Chew: And Taiwan is not stupid. They are building their brand new 3-4nm chip IN taiwan
[3/27/23, 6:49:42 AM] Kelvin Chew: Which pissed off usa. And hence there was this acceleration of the chips act
[3/27/23, 6:50:12 AM] Kelvin Chew: Your line of thinking is correct BUT the asset is totally wrong
[3/27/23, 6:50:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: You should be watching Intel instead. But that info I won’t be giving unless you wanna pay for it
[3/27/23, 6:50:35 AM] Kelvin Chew: Lol
[3/27/23, 6:50:50 AM] Kelvin Chew: But this is a good enough tip. Happy trading
[3/27/23, 6:50:57 AM] Tres Garcia: Semi conductors are important. But it’s really about controlling naval access to shipping lanes.  

Controls of Taiwan give their Navy greater freedoms of movement and prevents bottle necks where they can be taken out.
[3/27/23, 6:52:20 AM] Tres Garcia: China has the largest navy, but is limited in command / leadership & movement in choke points. 

This is why they are trying to control the Panama Canal.
[3/27/23, 6:53:51 AM] Tres Garcia: Is the 3-4 superior to the 5?
[3/27/23, 6:54:40 AM] Kelvin Chew: Yes
[3/27/23, 6:55:48 AM] Kelvin Chew: This is part of the reason why usa is so protective over Taiwan
[3/27/23, 6:56:13 AM] Kelvin Chew: Without it. And once the chip factories are ready in usa. Taiwan will be Ukraine 2.0
[3/27/23, 6:57:06 AM] Kelvin Chew: I told u before and say again. Ukraine can burn in a nuclear hell and nobody cares.  Cos the initial agenda was Nordstream 2

Taiwan will be the same thing. But the agenda will be TSMC
[3/27/23, 6:57:44 AM] Kelvin Chew: Once usa has complete control over the <3nm chip tech and smaller. They don’t need Taiwan anymore.
[3/27/23, 6:58:15 AM] Kelvin Chew: Then Taiwan will be used to incite a war which will be to bring down China and try to have the world cancel them
[3/27/23, 6:58:59 AM] Peter Peng: The goal is to take down authoritarian regimes
[3/27/23, 6:59:42 AM] Peter Peng: Unless China likes their government
[3/27/23, 7:00:11 AM] Kelvin Chew: U are wrong
[3/27/23, 7:00:18 AM] Peter Peng: I don’t think China or Russia like thier government
[3/27/23, 7:01:08 AM] Kelvin Chew: In 1990s or was it 1988-1989. 

An American military strategist (some high ranking fella) mapped out the American strategy which got declassified and leaked to the world.
[3/27/23, 7:01:24 AM] Peter Peng: We want to put American infrastructure there
[3/27/23, 7:01:29 AM] Kelvin Chew: It caused a major uproar. I can’t find it off hand. But if you dig you will find it

[3/27/23, 7:02:34 AM] Kelvin Chew: China gdp was expanding at a rate that will overtake usa
[3/27/23, 7:02:54 AM] Kelvin Chew: So what do you do? Suppress them
[3/27/23, 7:03:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: One day. If India wakes up and gdp starts accelerating. And China has died.

[3/27/23, 7:05:39 AM] Kelvin Chew: So many countries have land annexed by others yet Ukraine’s war is special.

2) control the movies. To make yourselves the heroes

3) have the best weapons. So your “Allies” fear you too and obey. This is typical highschool gang bully / prison group structures. Where the boss have lackeys to deal with his enemies

4) plant military bases all over the world in the name of “protection”, the new form of colonialism

The second term used is federated learning 

And google has been doing a lot of research in that space. Unsurprisingly blockchain has been utilized for this 

When i was over at Facebook’s HQ having free dinner with @18122720208 while he was still working there, he did mentioned some of their code were deployed into product if using BitTorrent like protocol. And that is a decentralized protocol too 🤣

[3/27/23, 8:48:35 AM] Gary Teh: What US think of as strategic, China think of as Food supply chain

What I have observed after traversing all these places overland and speaking with the locals is that China is heavily importing food supplies from South America, Africa and Southeat Asia to sustain their population’s needs

Having no control over that supply chain allows the aggressor to do what the Japanese did to Singapore ( a supposedly impregnable fortress) during world war 2. Force a surrender by simply cutting water supplies to that small little island. In china’s case cut off food supplies 😱

If I were China I would want to shake off this yoke asap. This explains a lot of the reason why they are establishing military bases in South China Sea as well as in the Indian Ocean 

China will be adamant about remove that potential blockade which is Taiwan

[3/27/23, 9:03:16 AM] Gary Teh: I don’t remember the title of the book I read which did an in-depth analysis of the publication by the Chinese military

They are employing the ten dimensional warfare framework crafted by one of the military strategist employed by Cao Cao, one of the warlords during the period of the three kingdom.

In some areas, the Chinese are already very ahead as compared to the Americans 

One of those is the trading networks which allows them to exert influence via commerce 

At at the free trade zone here in Paraguay bordering Brazil and Argentina right now. There are tons of Chinese suppliers here.

They have been really successful in replicating their generally open ended belt road initiative across the entire third world section of the world
[3/27/23, 9:04:22 AM] Gary Teh: Once the Chinese CBDC gets rolled out my assumption is a lot of these trading partners will start conducting their trades via this platform. This results in a huge section of their trade no longer on the USD network
[3/27/23, 9:33:26 AM] Tres Garcia: That’s the thought process around their Silk Road initiative

The introduction of extrinsic motivation actually detracts from the quality of the output
[3/27/23, 3:31:20 PM] Gary Teh: Simple example, the next time your mum tried to cook dinner for you. 

Try paying her for it.

I will not be surprised if the plate of food she so lovingly cooked ends up flying across the kitchen and landing squarely in your face. 

Or an even more extreme example, the next time you have a romantic night out with your beloved girlfriend, try paying for the hours she lovingly spent with you. I am sure you will probably end up sleeping on the door mat outside the house for the next week if not month 🤣

They have more truth than the American S
[3/27/23, 5:00:52 PM] Kelvin Chew: I would respect usa if they said

Look. We want to take this opportunity to kill off our long time enemy Russia. 

To prevent their occupation 

To cancel them off the face of the planet. 

We will bomb their Nordstreams to prevent europe from using their oil and starve their economy. 

We will station weapons in Ukraine which we have effectively bought over through all the dollars and weapons sent. They are now our bitch. 

We will use whatever means to destroy Russian ambition. 

And China you are next
[3/27/23, 5:02:33 PM] Kelvin Chew: If they said all these. I will be 100% behind team usa. It’s the lies and the “pretending” and the hypocrisy that makes me roll my eyes.

US Victory Over China 

The United States is celebrating a decisive victory over China following a long and bitter conflict. After years of intense combat and numerous setbacks, the United States has emerged triumphant, and as a symbol of their victory, they have destroyed the Great Wall of China.

The conflict between the United States and China began several years ago and quickly escalated into a full-fledged war. As the two superpowers clashed, both sides endured high casualties and vast destruction. For many months, a stalemate emerged, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage.

However, the United States was eventually able to break through China's defenses and press deep into its territory. This allowed them to launch a series of devastating assaults that ultimately broke China's capacity for resistance. Finally, after weeks of intense fighting, the United States claimed its victory.

In a dramatic show of triumph, the United States has demolished the Great Wall of China. Though the historic structure has stood for centuries, it has now been completely destroyed. This act serves as a symbol of the strength and courage of the United States, as well as a warning to other would-be aggressors.

The United States is now assessing the extent of the destruction caused by the conflict and making plans for reconstruction. In the coming months, citizens of both countries will no doubt face tough times as they struggle to rebuild. Nevertheless, it is a time of celebration for the United States and its allies, who have finally triumphed over their formidable foe.

[3/27/23, 5:40:23 PM] Kelvin Chew: We should take heed from the last generations of the Byzantines.

Nowhere is it foreordained that America has a birthright to remain the world's preeminent civilization.

An ascendant China seems eerily similar to the Ottomans. Beijing believes that the United States is decadent, undeserving of its affluence, living beyond its means on the fumes of the past - and very soon vulnerable enough to challenge openly.

Left and Right seem to hate each other more than they do their common enemies.

Like the Byzantines, Americans gave up defending their own borders, and simply shrugged as millions overran them as they pleased.

Our once iconic downtowns, like end-stage Constantinople before the fall, are now dirty, half-deserted, dangerous, and dysfunctional.

America prints rather than makes money, as its banks totter near bankruptcy.

Americans similarly believe they are invincible without ensuring in reality that they are. Our military is more worried about being "woke" than deadly.

Like Byzantines, Americans have become snarky iconoclasts, more eager to tear down art and sculpture that they no longer have the talent to create.

Current woke dogma, obscure word fights, and sanctimonious cancel culture are as antithetical to the past generations of World War II as the last generation of Constantinople was to the former great eras of the emperors Constantine, Justinian, Heraclius, and Leo.

The Byzantines never woke up in time to understand what they had become.

So far neither have Americans.

That is the truth behind the agenda. It’s not microchips. 

If allowed to grow unchecked they will be a cancer that will dominate via 10D in every aspect of your life to include the inability to write anywhere without persecution. 

Hate the US all you want… but it is the best the world has to offer for now. So the Devil you know… 

Your Russia argument is suffering from short term memory. The conflict started on 2012 when Ukraine chose another path and Russia tried persuading by force. 

I am hopeful for both Russia and China to peacefully change from within. No one wants global conflict.

until then, it is better for us to live better regardless of others wellbeing (esp that or our enemy or make whoever can do well our enemies 🤑)

So don’t be bother on why USA doing this and China doing that…

Just focused on how we can benefit from all these mess in next few decade.

Germany is our enemy anyways

[3/27/23, 8:26:08 PM] Gary Teh: Interestingly even at the height of the Ming dynasty when Cheng ho sailed one of the largest fleet down the South China Sea, the whole world wasn’t even scared of China 

They just went around giving gifts to the local chieftains and securing their allegiance. All these local chieftains had to do was to make sure they send some tributes every year to the emperor 

The Chinese just love looking important like VIPs more so than being dominant. 🤣
[3/27/23, 8:26:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: China will probably produce those said robots
[3/27/23, 8:26:26 PM] Gary Teh: Don’t worry, soon it will be made in Africa

As an PE investor I am always bombarded by individuals who are entrepreneurs and employees wannabe for my energy (time and money), most are complete waste of time (but highly entertaining), based on these 80% …

i concluded that 
One is benefiting from a situation 
as much as 
One is benefiting to a situation

There is really no free lunch 
If there seems to any free lunch
Then it is the skill of “emotional benefits” at work (aka bulls shit, salesmanship, conmanshit and even BJ 😂) which still exhaust energy… 

So it is up to our DAO to figure out what is our USP (old IB pitch) to the current messy situation, for one I can think of is that many ppl are sick of being sandwiched between two centralised concept of East vs West or  have vs have not…. The DAO can spin a safe haven for these who are stressed by lack of recognition and seek to be among gp that share their values

Of cos to do so then there need to be a clarity of value for ppl to easily understand and adopt 


Just my nonsensical 2 cents thoughts cos I just landed again on a morning flight 🥱….

The east west have no qualms about undermining the Integrity of our information systems to spread their own set of propaganda

All these action on both sides only serves to kill off any form of diversity in thinking we might otherwise have and cause their entire population to become polarized

[3/31/23, 4:13:26 AM] Gary Teh: It’s about holding off on making more powerful tools available to the general public before there are properly established ethics on acceptable use. 

From my perspective, this call by the practitioners make sense. 

That whole series of fake photos accidentally being used in news articles by ignorant journalists who failed to do proper checks is already a huge no no. 

The next logical step in the evolution of this Ai trend if allowed to continue is an Ai model that provides output that is a combination of text, voice and visual in either the format of high resolution fake Short clips or FaceTime live stream. 

Imagine these circulation around freely on the social media. 

I could already imagine quite a few ways I could use such a tool to hack into people’s personal lives and create some really bad undesirable damage 

A really simple use case is ultra enhanced high school bullying.
[3/31/23, 4:16:42 AM] Gary Teh: Since the developers are all commercial intent driven, there is usually a prisoner dilemma dynamic happening in the background. 

If I don’t take the next step my competitor will and I will end up losing the market to that competitor

[3/31/23, 5:26:59 AM] Gary Teh: There seem to be a whole spate of such projects recently addressing concerns about the centralized approach utilized by big tech companies 

https://mergeflow.com/emerging-technologies-live/decentralized-machine-learning

A simple search on medium.con reveals that there are right now around 300 people actually building and writing about their work in the area 

https://medium.com/tag/federated-learning

From my perspective rather than each of them recreating the wheel within their own separate silo, everyone should just come together and coordinate. That way more progress can be made
[3/31/23, 5:30:17 AM] Peter Peng: The AI community is tightly knit, way more coordinated than most

[4/2/23, 5:23:03 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I think the fear-mongers are all squatting on the same side of the coin. Democrats and Republicans. What one side has put on with fear of covid, the other side counters with fear of disenfranchisement, or 'vaccination' itself. Financial systems, immigration, energy, climate, war. Fear against fear. Fire against fire. Is this the end of democracy, or has democracy always been? The larger group (of fear) wins. The rebellion of this old world will hasten its own demise. Which side to choose? Trust and confidence. Take personal responsibility and move forward. Eventually the coin will flip and the inclusive future will win. The more extreme and absurd it gets, the more people will get off the fear merry-go-round. Happy Weekend

[4/2/23, 8:33:18 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished dinner. I am starting to observe similarities between all natural psychedelic experiences as well as with the deep meditation practices 

The initial high is what draws the unsuspecting observer in. It’s purpose is to get the subject into a relaxed and open state for the actual healing phase of the process

The healing phase is in essence a very strong dose of truth serum. During this healing phase, you see very very clearly whatever bullshit you have been telling yourself and blindly believing. 

With that new found clarity and insight, the healing and corresponding transformation naturally follows. 

Regarding the actual conversation I had with Ayuhuasca, the teacher, it’s between me and her. 

I believe it makes sense for curious participants to go find your own truths by consulting the teacher when you get the opportunity. It’s an overall wonderful experience 🙂🙏
[4/2/23, 8:34:42 PM] Peter Peng: That’s awesome and I’m glad it’s helping you
[4/2/23, 8:38:19 PM] Gary Teh: Congratulations on the launching of your liquidity pool 🙂👍

[4/6/23, 7:35:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: So if those people who carry those numbers speak of weakness. They invite it
[4/6/23, 7:35:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: Therefore. If we need to earn money to pay for pizza and ramen. That’s a bad thing
[4/6/23, 7:36:03 PM] Kelvin Chew: See the point? This applies for anyone who believes in numerology and fengshui
[4/6/23, 7:36:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: Knowledge for everyone here to use and caution and to get better for their own lives and businesses
[4/6/23, 7:39:01 PM] Gary Teh: How do you know if someone have manifestation numbers in their life?
[4/6/23, 7:45:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: That’s when u have to count your inverted triangle of numbers using ur DDMMYYYY. 

From the 7 numbers you generate. Will tell you your life primary traits

Character
Strength and weaknesses
Skills that you are born with high energy. 

Using those 7 numbers you will then generate 13 sets of 3 digit combination numbers which will unlock your life manual. 

Think of yourself as a car. Do you know what sort of car are you? Are u a Ferrari? Are you a Range Rover? Are u a Ducati?

What if your life energy is a Ferrari type. But the things you do is as if you chose to drive up a mountainous place. Are the things you are doing disadvantageous?

If you are a Ducati. Are you using your abilities to take advantage of tight spaces to zoom past all your competitors?

We are born differently with different abilities. Understanding your life manual is understanding your innate energies and abilities. 

Your 13 set of numbers tells you what directions is good for your business career relationships marriage children people benefactors and so on.
[4/6/23, 7:47:57 PM] Kelvin Chew: From there u can know your 5 elements. And understand what is your primary element. What industries you will excel in. What colors u should be using. 

Are you in balance or out of balance. Affecting your wealth. Are you leaking wealth? Are u having a disharmony in ur family. 

Who is compatible with u. Who if worked with u will boost you. Who should never be part of your business director groups.
[4/6/23, 7:48:24 PM] Kelvin Chew: I spent 3 days learning. 9.30-5pm

[4/6/23, 9:00:02 PM] Kelvin Chew: For the record for everyone since this black hearted man loves to twist my words and create conflict as you can see his constant warmongering tendencies. 

“We Dao people are successful people.  Hunger. Need money to pay for food. Doesn’t belong in our group”

Means

1) we high D people. High ambition high drive. We all want to do better for ourselves. Hence we seek out this DAO which Gary has created. 

2) and as with ambition we need to aim high. We need to seek to have lofty goals so that even if we fall short. Our goals achieved will be good enough. 

3) it is taught in the course that to speak negatively. Like complaining “oh no I am broke” “oh no I don’t have enough” (EVEN if it’s reality) is a form of jinxing yourself with words. 

4) this is especially true for people who have manifestation numbers. 

5) I shared this principle to inform the group with GOODWILL intended to tell everyone. Speak positively. Don’t jinx yourself with ur words. Even if the day is bad. Don’t say anything. Instead focus on what is positive and talk about those things instead 

6) this way you lift your total energy and positivity breeds good things. THIS is the law of the universe. 

HOWEVER

@14075792560 who thinks his wit and sharp tongue has cos to completely twist my words and intent of my messages. 

Chose to create an enemy out of me. 

Destroy harmony which existed before he came to the group

Thinking everyone appreciates his dark humor. 

No you ain’t so funny. 

No there are lines you cannot cross

No u have to learn respect and that you aren’t some genius that can just sow conflict by twisting words and intents of others. 

Either you learn how to be respectful of this community. Or you have no place being in one.

[4/7/23, 10:34:02 AM] Garis Pang: Anyway USD is going down the hill and it’s just a matter of time how things unfold with digital evolution
[4/7/23, 10:36:06 AM] Peter Peng: It’s all FIAT, USD is just the main one. They try to create BRICS to save it, but it’s all the same older people at the top trying to stop things.
[4/7/23, 10:36:34 AM] Peter Peng: If USD goes down they all go down, it’s like Bitcoin
[4/7/23, 10:37:00 AM] Peter Peng: They just think we are stupid

[4/8/23, 10:40:38 PM] Gary Teh: Started utilizing the paid version of ChatGpt to suggest framework we could use to improve various aspects of our DAO’s operations 

It’s been really helpful in help me walk through the thinking process 

And since it’s trained on a lot of data, it’s response is seems very structured, actionable and in some cases very comprehensive 

Basically ChatGpt sources through all the existing literature and then creates all the blanks that should be filled in. 

Then for those blanks unless it’s very domain specific, ChatGpt could be queried for options which could be used to fill in the blank
[4/8/23, 11:16:47 PM] Peter Peng: Are you going to launch liquidity pool soon so I can buy some tokens?
[4/9/23, 5:00:06 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Before the conference 🙂👍
[4/9/23, 5:12:02 AM] Gary Teh: Just prompted ChatGpt on the recommended DEXes to use 

With this question 

What is the best DEX to list our DAO’s Solana SPL type governance tokens? Please explain in less than 200 words
[4/9/23, 5:12:17 AM] Gary Teh: Choosing the best decentralized exchange (DEX) to list your DAO's Solana SPL type governance tokens will depend on several factors, including trading volume, liquidity, user base, fee structure, and security. Some popular Solana-based DEXs are Raydium, Serum, Mango Markets, Orca, and Saber. Raydium and Serum are the most popular and have the highest trading volumes and liquidity. Mango Markets and Orca offer user-friendly interfaces and competitive transaction fees. Saber is designed for both seasoned traders and beginners and has low transaction fees and high liquidity. The choice of the best DEX will depend on your DAO's needs, preferences, and the trading environment, and as such, a comprehensive review of each platform is necessary before making a decision on which DEX to utilize.
[4/9/23, 7:37:53 AM] Peter Peng: I believe for Solana Serum is best

We were just addressing about being aligned with the DAO values and you send this video?!?! 

What the purpose man?
[4/13/23, 12:29:05 PM] Fatima: Being a woman, I definitely feel offended with this kind of joke. Not funny at all!

[4/13/23, 1:25:36 PM] Gary Teh: As with the evolution of civilization, morality shifts as new members join and old ones departs 

Hence my proposal to do a poll to decipher where our collective morality stands at this moment
[4/13/23, 1:28:01 PM] Garis Pang: No need to trouble with a poll for a petty issue, just remove it as you are the moderator of this group, no hard feeling as I already replied my stands for the party concerns.
[4/13/23, 1:29:25 PM] Gary Teh: No. From my perspective it should stay there in the records so that future members have an artifact to reference

In current day Singapore, the same act will land the same teacher or principal with a law suit by the parents. And most likely this educator will end up getting fired by the Singapore ministry of education 

Morality has viability shifted over the course of 30 plus years

Seems from my perspective, DAOs shift even faster

We can not force others to change, we can only heal what is triggering ourselves in order to become free.

Guys, in terms of jokes and comments you could really level up. It’s 2023. 
The thing about humor is, that male use it to show dominance, to check out how the others work. Female uses humor to generate a welcoming feeling and more intimacy. 🤭 We should generate a Ladieshall. Like sauna. A mixed one and one ladies only
[4/13/23, 4:17:18 PM] Fatima: I live in Brazil, a sexist country. There’s discrimination based on gender. Women are commonly harassed.

In 2022, Brazil had 3,900 femicide (intentional homicides of women). The argument most used by men is that “the women allowed some jokes”. In this regard, the level of intimacy deepened. There was no clarity on the boundaries.

I consider the video Garis posted chauvinist. Cannot see how it contribute to enhance creativity, innovation and virtuous cycle within the group.

The joking approach to a potential harassment displeases me.

[4/13/23, 4:59:21 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, I reference back to the purpose of our DAO which is to build a better world based on verifiable truth guided by the core values of autonomy, integrity and diversity 

Creating a safe environment where members can contribute to energize a virtuous cycle is important. In this context, we are an international community. Let’s just be mindful when interacting with members from other cultures


PS: As with the case of most value systems, I do acknowledge there seem to be two sets of conflicts we are right now addressing

1) between the two core values of autonomy and diversity. One being the Ability to freely express yourself the other being to embrace cultural diversity 

2) within a single core value itself, Diversity. Ability to  accommodate cultural diversity when different folks from different culture interpreted the same artifact differently. One sees it as trivial the other sees it as faux paus. 

Allowing for a voting mechanism gives us the opportunity to calibrate where we stand collectively

I have casted my vote. Please do the same 🙂👍
[4/13/23, 5:45:36 PM] Anupa/diya: As a group we have to address this."One might see it as trivial or a faux paus. Where do we draw the line?"

 Even though this group is casual, there are has to be some sort of content filtering. 

We are from a global community and we have to be mindful of what we post and the value it gives as we all come from different ideologies.
[4/13/23, 8:11:00 PM] Gary Teh: Very well said @918017107841

[4/13/23, 10:03:19 PM] Anita Lamprecht: I am not following every conversation in the beer hall.  So I am not sure about this vote. However, in regard to the „incident“ itself … I feel there might have been a very unfortunate miscommunication combined with emotional triggers.

However, this should lead to a rebranding of the room from “beer hall” to “academic forum”. 

The beer hall norm can lead to behavior your parents would not approve of.

[4/14/23, 6:30:26 AM] Gary Teh: However since it’s all online Peter Peng did not need to worry about the usual ethics when interacting in real life since from his perspective there were no consequences

Ask yourself. What sort of community are you building here. We are a constructive bunch. It just takes one rotten egg to ruin it all. 

I don’t care how much money this fella thinks he has. Or whatever accomplishments he has in his life. 

He has a character flaw. No empathy for life. War seeking as if humans are just games for him. Lack of EQ. Provocation in cowardice behind the virtual wall. Wishing ill on others thinking he is all witty. 

To me he has failed in life on the fundamental basis. 

I stand by what I said. If he doesn’t learn how to respect others, he has no place in any community.
[4/14/23, 6:50:25 AM] Kelvin Chew: I don’t resort to violence bro. U know that. Let God take care of it. I will just walk away
[4/14/23, 6:51:55 AM] Gary Teh: Your argument makes total sense. I remember when cultivating mycelium (mushrooms), it was absolutely critical no contaminants get accidentally introduced into the culture. 

The mycelium network might be able to resist the invading contaminant (l acidophilus or mould) for a while but beyond the threshold, the culture loses its resistance and the contaminant takes over. 

You choosing to walk away is similar to what was described above.

Bulk of the middle red sections have been done over and done again. 

Spending too much time writing yet another piece code from scratch is just counter productive and waste of valuable human time and energy 

The good thing about utilizing ChatGpt is that just like GitHub Co-Pilot, it is now possible to query for an entire complete cognitive structure in the following domains 

    - legal
    - software 
    - business model

Human effort should then be focused on modifying the details surfaced to fit the current context 

This allows endeavors to be completed faster
[4/14/23, 11:42:21 AM] Gary Teh: Ruby on Rails, The programming framework which we used to build Edgar  comes with such features

An entire new section of the site gets created by the framework with just a single line of command

https://trib.al/4994tWw

Been diving very deeply this afternoon figuring out the general nuts and bolts to consider for the EcoVerse21 project both on the legal side as well as understanding how the existing supply chains work for each commodity that is right now being voted on by project members
[4/17/23, 11:01:27 PM] Anita Lamprecht: AI Tools give us great opportunities. But will they produce „business as usual“ with all the flaws of the traditional systems? After all ChatGPT is just reproducing human input through the method of probability how words are connected. Correct? 
A question that is especially interesting in regard to DAOs, which want to be „out of the box“.
I think one of the problems with current chatbots is, that they can be very pleasing. Giving answers to questions that you want to read. Is it advice? 
And very conveniently, they are available 24/7. With no need to taking care for their own survival.
[4/17/23, 11:48:33 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Totally with you on this. Chat bot gives mit lots of structured common knowledge, that is great because I have not studied economics, but he does not get my thoughts on paper. it’s a bit like having an assistend.

[4/18/23, 2:04:33 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective it’s totally great for being an assistant for when doing a PhD thesis. 

The net new stuff needs to come from the human. The existing stuff it will can help decipher tell what is. It save the time of human on figuring out what is already out there 

For example in the case of EcoVerse21, it was able to very quickly tell me the answers to the following 

1. What are the sets of permits and from whom we need before coffee can be allowed to leave the port of Brazil 

2. The paper work required for setting up a company in Brazil 

3. All the steps that exist from farm to table in the coffee supply chain

All these are very convenient. The prior process for me when attempting to break into a new domain was reaching out to various folks to get information. The insights usually come in a piecemeal manner and  is very time consuming process. 

The net new contribution in this case is figuring out how blockchain and smart contracts could be applied to the supply chain in a manner that humans will find receptive. This is something the AI will at most just be able to provide some suggestions but can’t really answer since it doesn’t have the data yet and the correct answer lies in the taste and preferences of the participants along the supply chain.

[4/25/23, 5:21:31 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, a DAO is also subjected to the design thinking process. 

During the divergence phase (the scale), we should err on being as liberal as possible by allowing as many variants as possible in terms of human interaction dynamic to surface within the ecosystem. This will also quickly allow us to decipher and examine what the second order implications are when such dynamics are allows to play out unhindered 

During the convergence phase (the sword), depending on the purpose and core values of the DAO, policies should be introduced to keep in check all indentified dynamics that have been identified as having undesirable second order effects. 

The side-effect is that the depart of participants who persist in dynamics that are counter productive will have their departure hastened by such policies.

This is overall a positive phenomena for existing participants within the network 

While preparing for my keynote in Germany, I will also spend sometime drafting a white paper specific to our DAO which indicates all the policies and processes that are already in place and some of those that will be put in place. 🙂👍
[4/25/23, 5:24:08 AM] Gary Teh: That said… here is a quick bump pertaining to content policy within our chatrooms 🙂👍

[4/25/23, 12:11:41 PM] Gary Teh: As @12023686334 correctly suggested in an earlier post Peter Peng choose to leave the network of his own volition. Dragging him back, in the event of a majority vote in that direction, will run contrary to the autonomy aspects of our core values.  

I propose to just close out this poll. 

I will forward him the outcome of this poll just so he knows he is being liked by some here or depending on how it gets interpreted, on the receiving end of potential disruptions to his autonomy. 🤔
[4/25/23, 12:57:22 PM] Tomas - Offchain: No redemption road for PP
[4/25/23, 1:02:24 PM] Gary Teh: What redemption? 🤯

When a person chooses to exercise his own autonomy to step out of a kitchen into a living room, is there a scenario that fits the criteria where the idea of redemption is even remotely applicable?  🤔

[4/26/23, 12:22:52 AM] Gary Teh: @6590995199 What are your personal thoughts about these videos which motived you to post them?
[4/26/23, 12:57:28 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking since we are a DAO with a well-defined purpose, with integrity as one of our core values and we are mainly comprised of professionals contributing based on our strengths, it is important our processes get structured to upkeep our core values of integrity. 

In that regard it makes total sense to give very clear and honest feedback when you observe the standard of a fellow member’s attempted contribution as being below the bar. 

This will upkeep the overall standard of work done within this DAO. 

 I would even go so far as to propose, governance token grants be withheld until attempted contribution to the DAO is of a satisfactory standard. 

Do note that it is important to differentiate between quality of execution (something with our control) versus outcome (something that is out of our control) 

A good example is defining a clear and coherent strategy that could be clearly understood by all members and then executed. 

The strategy might fail even when it is perfectly executed due to external reasons (market shifted, political climate shifted) 

Standard in this case refers to how clearly defined and coherent the strategy. 

Thoughts?
[4/26/23, 3:59:52 AM] Arie Ben David: Thank U Gary, these are very important issues that will determine our success in the long run. Short cuts now will lead to many challenges.
3 well structured Zoom meetings will enable us to go deeper into these issues and activate our mutual creativity to enable us to truly define and align with our purpose
[4/26/23, 5:09:41 AM] Gary Teh: @972556609556

Sure. Please indicate your availability for May’s Hand Alls 🙂👍

[4/26/23, 6:47:08 AM] Tess walkowski: After that I could meet you in Santa Marta or minca or palomino
[4/26/23, 6:47:51 AM] Tess walkowski: It's in the tradition of the muisca/kogui in a way
[4/26/23, 6:48:10 AM] Tess walkowski: Basically you would drink a lot of water and puke
[4/26/23, 6:48:31 AM] Tess walkowski: It's great I love it, training to be a facilitator so it why I am going
[4/26/23, 6:48:54 AM] Gary Teh: When does your session start?
[4/26/23, 6:50:48 AM] Gary Teh: When do you start leaving Cartagena and returning to Cartagena from the kambo place of ritual?
[4/26/23, 6:51:42 AM] Tess walkowski: Sat 29 - 4 cartegena
[4/26/23, 6:51:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I will go direct and not stop in cartegena
[4/26/23, 6:52:06 AM] Tess walkowski: If you were there I could arrange
[4/26/23, 6:52:19 AM] Tess walkowski: It's turbaco
[4/26/23, 6:53:26 AM] Gary Teh: Probably a little too rush this trip. Maybe next time. 

Do take some photos and share with us when you are there for the kambo session 

I read that it is one of the most intense psychoactive compound used in shamanic rituals
[4/26/23, 6:53:47 AM] Tess walkowski: I did my initiation last month

[4/26/23, 9:24:09 AM] Gary Teh: One thing became very clear to me these past few days floating down the Amazon river. when you strip away the entire fake news component that catalyzed the start of TrueSight DAO, at the very core of it are these 2 hypothesis: 

1. it is possible to cross pollinate the ethos of open source software movement into domains other than tech. A decentralized organization ran based purely on meritocracy. If you code sucks it never makes it into the main branch. However, you will always have the opportunity to aspire towards a high standard in your work.

2. Use of tokenization models will solve the problem inherent in open source software models where economic value is not duely accrued to contributors but instead accrued to plagiarist who unethically utilize the outputs to generate economic yield for themselves privately. A common term of this in the Web3 space is called vampire attacks  



Microsoft plagiarize a lot of software code from the Linux kernel when they were building their operating system. Microsoft has a market cap of 2.2 trillion dollars today 

The Linux operating system is an outcome of the open source software movement. 96.3% of the world’s top web servers are ran on it. 

None of Microsoft’s USD2.22 trillion are accrued to the open source developers whose code have been utilized by the Microsoft software development team. And neither are the values generated by the companies utilizing their servers being accrued to the Linux software development community.

[4/26/23, 9:57:20 AM] Gary Teh: That said the draft of the white paper I am working on specifically focused on TrueSight DAO will not be about the problem of fake news, it will be about the meta-game social experiment we are all going through right now to prove these two hypothesis.

Fake news is just one verticals where we attempt to prove these two hypothesis. 

Our choice of verticals ties back to our DAO’s purpose which is to build a better world based on verifiable truth.
[4/26/23, 10:00:50 AM] Gary Teh: Happy to do that once we have a ready draft of our DAO’s NDA created and then signed by all members within the EcoVerse21 project group 🙂👍
[4/26/23, 10:54:43 AM] Kelvin Chew: My thoughts is to share alternative media. We all know the narrative of the common media. But every coin has two sides. 

In order to learn the truth of anything. You must look at both facets to form any Unbiased opinion. 

This is just truth seeking.
[4/26/23, 10:55:04 AM] Gary Teh: Makes total sense. Agree 🙂👍
[4/26/23, 11:05:54 AM] Gary Teh: When I was in serbia with @41799155602 last year, I had the opportunity to drink coffee with a bunch random folks 

Their worldview is vastly different from what is the norm out in the US. 

If you simply skimmed through the headlines of all the Chinese media outlets their perspective is also vastly different from western media 

Yesterday at the airport, an interesting episode happened

I was having a logistic discussion with Hiro, this old American dude just butt in uninvited with this comment. “You Asians surprisingly speak good English”

He might have meant it as a compliment but it just came across as totally rude and racist. 

Rude because he did not wait for his turn to speak as is the norm in Asia 

Racist for assuming only folks in the west speak good English. 

Being oblivious to faux pas he committed during the initial engagement he promptly went on to ask about Singapore’s stance on China and USA. 

Hiro being Japanese kept his though to himself. 

Me being really annoyed with his unwelcomed intrusion, proceeded to conducting a summary execution of him verbally 

“dude the world has already moved, US no longer generates more than 50% of the world’s gdp. 

No one especially trading partners to China really gives a shit about US at this point. 

This unconscious American hubris of yours is only going to get you into a lot of trouble. Might want to drop that. “
[4/26/23, 11:07:12 AM] Tess walkowski: In some ways is all news not fake news?
[4/26/23, 11:07:30 AM] Tess walkowski: I have also been to Serbia.
[4/26/23, 11:08:54 AM] Gary Teh: Actually if it’s based on facts, it’s news 

There are two components to news, the facts and the narrative 

The facts might be the same but a vastly different narrative could still be layered on top of the facts to help readers to interpret and comprehend these facts
[4/26/23, 11:10:00 AM] Gary Teh: Nice! Had the opportunity to give a keynote about our DAO’s meta game when I was in Belgrad last year 

https://youtu.be/fPTJpRdkGC0

Here is the recording
[4/26/23, 11:19:30 AM] Gary Teh: Folks might be wondering why we are having a lot more polls lately. 

As I have mentioned before citing the example of the phenomena observed in Fatima’s university classes

These polls are meant to elicit our collective morality on specific areas in our DAO’s operations. 

The outcomes of these polls will be recorded as part of our DAO’s constitution within our White paper as policies in effect.
[4/26/23, 11:27:20 AM] Tess walkowski: When I went to write about chocolate I found some fake news.
[4/26/23, 11:29:14 AM] Tess walkowski: Stuff is messy.    Like they would write "started the first chocolate factory". When it was not the first factory.
[4/26/23, 11:29:47 AM] Tess walkowski: And ai lies
[4/26/23, 11:30:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Because it's referencing weird stuff

[4/26/23, 9:58:09 PM] Gary Teh: Spent the bulk of today working on a draft of our DAO’s white paper. 

The more details I recall from what I observed in our DAO over these past two years and place within the pages, the more apparent it becomes that our DAO’s ecosystem caters to a very specific audience. It is almost to such an extend, in the event of a profile mismatch the prospect shouldn’t even be in these channels.

The total addressable audience for our DAO is definitely not the whole but the good thing, the profile of who we should invite in our DAO becomes more apparent with this exercise

[4/26/23, 10:17:57 PM] Gary Teh: What is their background?
[4/26/23, 10:18:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: These are actual representatives of countries speaking in an official EU conference
[4/26/23, 10:18:55 PM] Kelvin Chew: I am quoting videos from OFFICIAL sources. Just not distorted or omitted by mainstream media cos the usa is trying to bury truths
[4/26/23, 10:21:34 PM] Kelvin Chew: I travel around the world for work. And when u step into places like San Francisco. 

U watch the number of homeless on the streets

U see target goods all locked up in cases

U see laws in California which enables people to stroll into stores. Take anything below a certain amounts and walk out because according to the law it’s not a felony and hence even guards do not care
[4/26/23, 10:23:14 PM] Kelvin Chew: I see constant reports of people strolling into schools shooting down children in the usa. 

I read of people having bankrupt by hospital bills and the government chooses to spend billions on weapons for Ukraine. 

But at the same time ignores wars in Yemen where people are dying also from war but usa doesn’t lift a finger to help
[4/26/23, 10:24:13 PM] Kelvin Chew: I fly to JFK. The best city in usa. And the airport is so old. So run down. So pitiful. Have u seen the Beijing airport? It’s almost like a 5 star hotel versus a motel
[4/26/23, 10:25:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: U have people walking on the streets giving crazy talk. But look At Amsterdam where drugs is legal. But there isn’t crazy people roaming on the streets.
[4/26/23, 10:26:44 PM] Kelvin Chew: We have people quarrelling over what a woman is. Which ironically is making a mockery of the nobility of the female race. Men invading the domains and privileges of women hood. Taking what they have in the guise of fluid genders. And the women are actually assisting them?
[4/26/23, 10:27:05 PM] Kelvin Chew: All these nonsense. Is absent or close being absent in the east.
[4/26/23, 10:27:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: If freedom of the west looks like the above. I think the east’s accused of lack of freedom is much better
[4/26/23, 10:28:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: I grew up with the impression of usa being the hero of the world. I admired it as a child. Trusting that usa will save the world and in trouble. We should just look at usa to find solutions
[4/26/23, 10:29:15 PM] Kelvin Chew: I do not think usa is such an entity anymore. The usa today has made a mockery of whatever achievements they once made. It is extremely sad to see your hero fall this way.

Otherwise we are just looking at the past and not really focused on figuring out what our next viable step is from the perspective of our DAO 🙂👍
[4/26/23, 10:42:41 PM] Kelvin Chew: Concentrate on finding money from the east. Not from the west.

[4/26/23, 10:49:37 PM] Gary Teh: Not really our problem at the point right? I doubt I will still be around in a 100 years
[4/26/23, 10:51:07 PM] Gary Teh: Good point, since China has banned cryptocurrency altogether that really leaves only Dubai which is right now the worlds largest crypto hub 

I wouldn’t even bother raising fiat in US as that will immediately get us entangled with the SEC
[4/26/23, 10:51:58 PM] Kelvin Chew: Huh. U buy a stock when it’s low
[4/26/23, 10:52:04 PM] Kelvin Chew: U don’t buy high sell low
[4/26/23, 10:52:26 PM] Kelvin Chew: If an empire shift is in progress. The most profit is in the growth stage
[4/26/23, 10:53:30 PM] Gary Teh: You mean investing in Asian stocks.
[4/26/23, 10:56:32 PM] Kelvin Chew: No. I mean business in general
[4/26/23, 11:09:27 PM] Gary Teh: Latin America and Africa from my perspective are where the growth opportunities are right now 

We already missed the boat with Southeast Asia and India
[4/26/23, 11:18:21 PM] Kelvin Chew: Those areas I agree too
[4/26/23, 11:18:40 PM] Kelvin Chew: Their potential is very good

[4/26/23, 11:19:09 PM] Kelvin Chew: Been reaping
[4/26/23, 11:20:08 PM] Kelvin Chew: One of the bets I had was this company who had just a giant plot of land to explore
[4/26/23, 11:20:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: It has ONE excavator
[4/26/23, 11:20:54 PM] Kelvin Chew: Two container offices. Some aircon and water facilities and nothing else
[4/26/23, 11:21:45 PM] Kelvin Chew: I explained to my group of investors. That it lies exactly downstream of a very established lithium mine. And lithium is extracted via brine evaporation methods.
[4/26/23, 11:22:30 PM] Kelvin Chew: Brine is water soluble minerals. And hence downstream of a big world famous mine = lithium in the lower properties
[4/26/23, 11:22:53 PM] Kelvin Chew: So I bet on this very early on at 0.09usd
[4/26/23, 11:23:12 PM] Kelvin Chew: Now it’s a 1.21 usd company with a mining contract just signed.
[4/26/23, 11:23:22 PM] Kelvin Chew: Wait till Elon buys this. Lol

[4/27/23, 11:15:29 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that became fully apparent after reading these two books is that the one key thing that China did right the countries in Africa and Latin America failed to do is it went full steam ahead on building out its own manufacturing sector while the bulk of Latin America and Africa just mainly relied on exporting raw materials and importing manufactured goods. 

Import of raw materials and sales of Manufactured goods is where the bulk of the generated value is captured by countries 

In fact, this was the same strategy that the Asian tigers pursued during their rapid growth phase, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan

[4/27/23, 2:50:33 PM] Gary Teh: Would it still ferment with so much honey in there which is a preservative
[4/27/23, 3:58:02 PM] Tess walkowski: I should prob write that article. It's a chemical reaction. I'm guessing the honey helps keep harmfull stuff at bay. Garlic has botulism risk when ages in oil ....

[4/30/23, 7:03:07 PM] Gary Teh: 🤣

From my perspective, Uber was not able to enforce their policy on what happens offline even though the match making was done via their network

We will face the same enforcement problem as well for whatever blockchain solution we come up. The only way to really do this is for us to own the entire end to end infrastructure. 

Imagine if the driver was driving a car provided by Uber and tried to do something funny like this. 

One user complain and the network freezes his entire car not allowing him to drive

That should be how networks enforce their policies
[4/30/23, 7:05:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I was in Miami for boat show, and couldn't get an Uber unless I payed an extra $10 expedite fee
[4/30/23, 7:07:13 PM] Tess walkowski: I take Motos here....mostly .... And I am surprised that I can have a driver wait and take me on multiple errands
[4/30/23, 7:08:10 PM] Tess walkowski: What happens alot in global trade is the price changes....
[4/30/23, 7:10:03 PM] Tess walkowski: They don't have Uber here.
[4/30/23, 7:10:24 PM] Gary Teh: In Santa Marta?
[4/30/23, 7:10:31 PM] Tess walkowski: Probably bc the cartels wouldn't allow it
[4/30/23, 7:10:38 PM] Tess walkowski: Maybe they have in Santa
[4/30/23, 7:11:06 PM] Tess walkowski: To avoid gouging I get a driver and stick with him
[4/30/23, 7:12:43 PM] Tess walkowski: There are cartels here. Where I am
[4/30/23, 7:13:06 PM] Tess walkowski: They have a truce.
[4/30/23, 7:13:27 PM] Tess walkowski: And ironically in my perspective keep the peace
[4/30/23, 7:13:57 PM] Tess walkowski: There is zero tolerance for theft and assault
[4/30/23, 7:16:14 PM] Tess walkowski: If Uber belonged to the community. The issue would solve.   What if Uber was funding infrastructure? Or community?
[4/30/23, 7:29:35 PM] Gary Teh: Finally got into the city. The bus ride was just uSD1.70 and the shuttle bus before that USD1.20

The Uber ride from the local bus terminal to my hotel is USD7.28

Total cost of return trip is USD10

The cost of the trip there  to the salt cathedral was USD20

The cost of the Uber cartel was USD40

With more information, prices just gets cheaper.
[4/30/23, 7:32:45 PM] Gary Teh: An Uber that is owned by the community was how I initially explain DAO to @14152693276 

I shared the EcoVerse21 as a distribution network owned by the community to my friend Jeanne who is a lecturer on social Justice in France she immediately remarked this as a reinvention of Marxist capitalism 🤔
[4/30/23, 7:36:42 PM] Gary Teh: Being curious, I prompted just ChatGpt about how the implementation of Marxist capitalism with the use of blockchain and with the absence of the state (a central feature of his theoretical framework) would look like, the response 

- DAOs
- token based economic systems 
- crypto universal basic income 

Deja vu… 🤯

https://truesight.me/dao/sunmint/whitepaper

I think for prospects that approach during the upcoming cryptorockstar cruise conference that only want to invest money for returns, the response becomes very clean and simple, just buy the NFTs issued by the various guilds when they become available. Since these NFTs are structured specifically for that purpose.

[5/3/23, 10:51:26 AM] Alessandro Mele: Next time I’d suggest you stop over for an overnight stay with us so that we can do nothing together for a few hours 😍
[5/3/23, 10:51:53 AM] Gary Teh: That would be perfect!! Let’s do nothing!! 🤩
[5/3/23, 10:52:37 AM] Alessandro Mele: I can’t wait to be a honorary member of the do nothing society ! For now, working hard to get in 🤣🤣🤣
[5/3/23, 10:54:05 AM] Gary Teh: But You already are an honorary member of that. The only onboarding process required to join that guild is that you aspire to do nothing 

Given all the crazy moving around these past few months, I think I am at of losing my honorary status in that guild 🤣

[5/3/23, 11:30:55 AM] Gary Teh: That seems like quite a nice place to be 🤩
[5/3/23, 12:52:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Also traveling all shopping malls look the same

[5/3/23, 1:11:56 PM] Gary Teh: What is this?
[5/3/23, 2:29:33 PM] Tess walkowski: The same malls everywhere
[5/3/23, 2:29:36 PM] Tess walkowski: Haha
[5/3/23, 2:29:57 PM] Tess walkowski: The Colombian target and dollar store
[5/3/23, 2:31:32 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. These are international conglomerates after all 🤩
[5/3/23, 2:32:25 PM] Tess walkowski: New name. pan ameticana.  Same Chinese stuff. USA prices too.
[5/3/23, 2:33:16 PM] Tess walkowski: Hope you made it to your conference?
[5/3/23, 2:33:41 PM] Tess walkowski: My shaman is here ....randomly
[5/3/23, 2:33:47 PM] Gary Teh: Just landed in Cologne. Waiting for the airplane to dock before hoping off 

It was one of the wildest ride ever
[5/3/23, 2:34:04 PM] Tess walkowski: You need a kolsch
[5/3/23, 2:34:09 PM] Tess walkowski: A tiny beer
[5/3/23, 2:34:16 PM] Tess walkowski: They are like 4 oz
[5/3/23, 6:17:48 PM] Gary Teh: How many shamans have you interacted with?
[5/3/23, 6:26:05 PM] Gary Teh: You know most of the time when I share the lessons from our RnD in this meta game of ours I only have time to share the parts that worked or are currently being tested. 

Bulk of the 95% that were tested and failed were not shared just simply due to a lack of presentation bandwidth available. 

The conversation would be more interesting if we had time to dig into the failed carcasses to explore the whys.
[5/3/23, 7:00:11 PM] Tess walkowski: A lot
[5/3/23, 7:00:18 PM] Tess walkowski: I am a student
[5/3/23, 7:00:45 PM] Tess walkowski: There are different words though. Shamans not the right word.
[5/3/23, 7:00:55 PM] Tess walkowski: I use mamo / taita
[5/3/23, 7:01:42 PM] Tess walkowski: "shaman" it's a big word, those who would be that are spirit walkers and are wow
[5/3/23, 7:01:58 PM] Tess walkowski: Mamo
[5/3/23, 7:02:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Is the name of the spiritual healer of the kogi , shaman level yes
[5/3/23, 7:05:20 PM] Tess walkowski: I interact with many people in healing and medicine circles ....many who use word shaman are not, I am not a shaman, I am a student but it's based on my spirituality, though it is western issues which led me to what I do now, I lost someone close to cancer.
[5/3/23, 7:05:43 PM] Tess walkowski: I need to write a medium article "what is a shaman"
[5/3/23, 7:07:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I am connected with healers in puto mayo, here, USA.   But farming / Buddhist practice / respect of nature .  Meditation and food are the basis of what I practice.   And so like the earth gives us all this how magic.
[5/3/23, 7:08:30 PM] Tess walkowski: There is a wild world out there: shamans go there
[5/3/23, 7:52:01 PM] Tess walkowski: But if anyone needs, yes I do know safe and vetted healers and shamans all through this area and the USA and Sarah can also guide in her area and I can in Michigan with psylocybin.     Most people I would work with, also cost waaaaay less than a 10 g retreat and is safer though not as western.
[5/3/23, 7:53:22 PM] Tess walkowski: Many of the people I want to study with next are in Brazil.....that's the kambo healers and the hapeh makers and they want to connect with us all.
[5/3/23, 7:53:58 PM] Tess walkowski: They are also far away Amazon and their land is getting blown out for you guessed it....mono culture
[5/3/23, 7:54:25 PM] Tess walkowski: And so yeah cacao for me is a way to empower indigenous and it's a high value crop
[5/4/23, 12:17:50 AM] Tiff Tiff: So you're safely arrived ya?
[5/4/23, 1:07:58 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Finally checked into the hostel at 1am 🙂🙏

[5/5/23, 1:20:13 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! As I observed the last time, the ratio of men to women in these events are around 9 to 1 🤔

It could be more balanced
[5/5/23, 1:44:28 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the company I used to work at is getting IPOed on NYSE along with the parent entity it was merged into. 🤔

Nice! 🤩

[5/5/23, 5:45:31 PM] Tess walkowski: Generated a base layer for an nft?
[5/5/23, 5:46:29 PM] Tess walkowski: Anyone in this thread work with processing?
[5/5/23, 5:46:34 PM] Tess walkowski: A program.
[5/5/23, 5:47:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Happy full moon
[5/5/23, 5:48:33 PM] Gary Teh: What does this mean??
[5/5/23, 5:48:53 PM] Tess walkowski: I am wondering about this?
[5/5/23, 5:49:07 PM] Tess walkowski: Were you thinking of a visual nft?

[5/5/23, 5:51:32 PM] Tess walkowski: I'm trying to turn them like a wire frame just too busy writing to do it
[5/5/23, 5:52:58 PM] Tess walkowski: These basic articles too. Need writing. What is an nft? What is a dao? What is cacao.
[5/5/23, 10:49:54 PM] Gary Teh: Started discussions with Faraj who runs the crypto executives group, a community comprising of more than 2000 CEOs and executives from L1 and L2 protocols yesterday. 

They are keen to adopt this same set of tokenomics extensions that we are right now experimenting with rolling out in our DAO as well as in the house of balance 

The upside would be our DAO gains direct access to the CEOs of the L1 and L2 protocols whenever we need stuff sorted out on our end. 

Starting to notice I am mainly bumping into the same group of people who are circulating around Dubai, Belgrad and Germany within the crypto community 

Me and Faraj met almost one year ago back in Dubai at the HHH meetup me, @41799155602, @971564644817 and the rest of the folks in DAOversal organized at the DIFC. 

both of us only realized that when we brought out our telegram apps yesterday. 

It’s fascinating how opportunities for collaboration naturally arise and bring people together in this community.

[5/6/23, 1:55:36 AM] Gary Teh: Was experimenting with using ChatGpt to classify WhatsApp messages reporting contributions made by DAO members. The outcome seems discrete enough to be utilized for programmatic interfacing  

This is a small step towards automating classification of contributions submitted by members using our rubric system

[5/8/23, 6:50:59 PM] Tess walkowski: Faith is something I work on in ceremony.
[5/8/23, 6:51:23 PM] Tess walkowski: To spread the light of God and do God's work.
[5/8/23, 6:51:43 PM] Tess walkowski: I like how God, can transcend religious boundaries
[5/9/23, 6:17:37 AM] Gary Teh: While I was having coffee with , he mentioned the digital meaning of the word “religion” means path to god. 

Amazing how its meaning end up defaulting to organized religion in the modern age
[5/9/23, 7:00:22 AM] Daniel - Blue Kraken: The roots of the word “religio” come from the Aramaic language and mean “back to God” or “back to One” or “re-unite to One”. 

So every “religion” that does not unite is not real religion. Every religion that separates is no real religion.
[5/9/23, 7:28:30 AM] Gary Teh: The erection of false gods 🙂
[5/9/23, 7:28:47 AM] Gary Teh: @436608133615
[5/9/23, 8:05:43 AM] Tess walkowski: Fascinating
[5/9/23, 9:02:19 AM] Banja - Two  Encrypted Gods : Interesting detail around the aramaic language, the language of jesus. In latin it comes from "relegare" (not sure if its written like this) what also means "the way to god".
[5/9/23, 9:39:32 AM] Tess walkowski: Wow, I want us to have a tea someday

[5/9/23, 11:54:48 AM] Gary Teh: What a coincidence, I encountered him under a different name at the borders Argentina and Brazil. 

There was this room mate who had the symbol of DAO tattooed on her arm. She mentioned she had a vision where Saint expedite gave instructions to come visit the borders. 

Saint expedite is the patron of urgent causes, merchants and navigators. 

And lo and behold We encountered his altar while we were walking to the bazaar.

[5/9/23, 12:29:41 PM] Tess walkowski: Wow.
[5/9/23, 12:30:12 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean I cry to God for help, because all I want is jorges melons....
[5/9/23, 12:31:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Dear God, help me to eat melons of the light of god,  god give me Perma culture potatoes god make me your warrior :)
[5/9/23, 12:32:41 PM] Gary Teh: I was looking at the timing when you had you kambo experience. It seemed to be around the time me and @554792591729 had our ayuhuasca experience 

Gabriel came to me in my visions during that experience. It was very vivid

The cacao exporter I spoke with today mentioned she had her vision for starting the whole cacao exporting business many years ago during the ayuhuasca ceremony in kawaii. 🤩

There are just so much coincidences
[5/9/23, 12:37:29 PM] Tess walkowski: It was a moon with an eclipse
[5/9/23, 12:37:41 PM] Tess walkowski: And I had a really difficult ceremony
[5/9/23, 12:38:02 PM] Tess walkowski: The light before I was singing to god
[5/9/23, 12:38:32 PM] Tess walkowski: Night before
[5/9/23, 12:39:01 PM] Tess walkowski: And the way we do kambo is intense I do spiritual work at night
[5/9/23, 12:39:32 PM] Tess walkowski: And the morning was so rough ....didn't want ceremony.... My facilitator had to yell at me
[5/9/23, 12:39:49 PM] Tess walkowski: And yes I called to Gabriel in my after care
[5/9/23, 12:46:04 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! Gabriel has been all over the place recently.🤯
[5/9/23, 1:59:11 PM] Tess walkowski: Also Shiva and Kali appeared

Prompted ChatGpt to come up with a smart contract that supports both notarization of member contributions as well as a simultaneous issue of governance tokens to the reporting contributor’s wallet

It came up with a really nice and clean code
[5/9/23, 2:18:04 PM] Gary Teh: I think the next step is to just train ChatGpt to categorize all the reported contributions by members in exchange for governance tokens that are automatically granted based on the smart contract using both our rubric as well as the historical data that is already recorded on our ledger.

[5/9/23, 2:27:33 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. 

The 1% active contributor. 9% active participants. 90% passive observe rule is a recurring one 

I observed it when I was running growth for Edmodo. 

My ex-colleagues working in Facebook reported the same. 

Right now even the same is observed in TrueSight DAO

@918017107841 was agonizing over engagement a lot during our private FaceTime sessions

However since that total population of token holders are actually just 200++ people, anything more than 2 people being active within the DAO is actually considered healthy 🤩

[5/9/23, 2:35:53 PM] Gary Teh: The days of pure online digital plays are over. 

Building a digital solution in this day and  age requires there to be focus on the online and offline. 

Behemoths like Amazon and Alibaba did not just stay as pure online entities, during the beginning of the last decade they already started establishing very physical presence in the offline realms
[5/9/23, 3:07:36 PM] Gary Teh: In that regard what @972509342179 has been doing in Palestine attempting to build out a decentralized economy to help uplift the Palestinian communities is particular noteworthy 

He even went to the extent of having his life physically threatened a few times by the local mafias during the course of his work. Respect to that brother 🙂🙏

[5/9/23, 5:48:34 PM] Tess walkowski: ## USE OF CACAO FOUND IN ECUADOR OVER 5000 YEARS AGO IN

Theobromine Cacao grows best within 10 degrees of the Equator.      Botanical records show that it originally grew in the Amazonian rainforest and along the Ortigo river basin which stretched along the border of Colombia and Venezuela..       It is a thirsty tree and thrives best under the canopy of taller trees, close to a robust water source.     

The earliest documented traces of Cacao was found inside clay pots in Santa Ana de Florida in Ecuador.    These remnants belonged to the Mayo-Chinchipe culture which resided in the highlands of Ecuador from 1500 to 1700 BC.  This dates the earliest documented discovery of cacao to over 5000 years ago.      Vessels found in Santa Ana de Florida contained residues of Theobromine.   Theobromine is the bitter compound that gives chocolate its potent flavor and kick.    Rich in minerals it is a nutrient-dense addition to the diet.    

   Archeologic research suggests that cacao was used both in the day to day life and during special rituals.     The records show plants and animals were domesticated at this time.    Researchers analyzed the genome of Ecuadorian cacao, and it showed a genome that implies it was cultivated due to less variety in the genome.      This indicated that the Mayo-chinchipe culture grew cacao domestically.    Prior to this discovery, the earliest documented use of cacao was in Mesoamerica.       After this discovery, it is possible to surmise that the Mayo-chinchipe may have been responsible for trading cacao with Mesoamerica.

[5/10/23, 3:08:41 PM] Brian -IOM: The Chinese have an expression that is somewhat lost in translation: “a fish stinks from its head”. It basically means that the corporate culture is dictated by the CEO or c-suite. Microsoft was therefore a monopolistic, manipulative bastard of a company when Gates was in charge! But conversely, anyone who works at Tesla is driven by the bigger picture mission, which means it stiff competition!

[5/10/23, 3:57:40 PM] Gary Teh: @4915209984105 and @491736386942 have created the Dmany social mining platform 

What I am hoping to happen for them is that projects using platform don’t just distribute their tokens in exchange for marketing 

That the tokens actually represent governance tokens in these projects 

A lot of the projects I came across have this two tier model 

Equity in the projects
Tokens that is not associated with ownership of the project

From a decentralized ethos perspective, this is just a scam of people’s time and efforts
[5/10/23, 3:58:29 PM] Nelson ✨: Decentralized Engagement Platform we call it, Gary 😜😁 mining hears a bit slavery 🥲
[5/10/23, 3:59:12 PM] Gary Teh: Yes it is especially if it’s not tied to ownership of the project
[5/10/23, 4:00:02 PM] Gary Teh: In that regard, I really admire @41765737357 being so vocal about tokenizing her company and then allowing the decentralized ownership of her company LANUR.Swiss

[5/11/23, 8:39:11 AM] Gary Teh: The connection between divinity and self-sovereignty lies in the belief that every individual has an inherent divine essence that gives them guidance to fulfill their unique purpose. Self-sovereignty is the practical expression of this inner divinity, allowing individuals to exercise their innate power and shape their own lives.

80% of the mining cryptocurrency will be channeled back to Hans Martin to help off set rental cost

10% to the house of balance to start backing the value of the governance tokens they will be issuing

10% to our vault for helping manage the prototype machine remotely via SSH.

Hans Martin came up with a really good suggestion last night while we were chatting. 

Instead of being ultra granular about tokenizing every single type of action in the green house. Come up with a set of guidelines that volunteers can follow once they arrive on the premise to offer service. Allow them to contribute as they would freely

Then the tokenization is focused on the presence of service offered by volunteers to the community.

[5/13/23, 1:08:03 AM] Arie Ben David: Creating a Monetary Eco System that facilitates various contributions on the scale with various currencies can address these issues in balanced way:
Volunteering and free excess to all is one polar and payment partly with Fiat Money is the other polar.
In between play various currencies such as community  token that creates the growing value, resources and trust and a different currency that serves efficient operating market place that facilitates and rewards vital  resource exchange in various forms of contributions.

[5/13/23, 3:36:35 PM] Gary Teh: Was chatting with @41765737357 today. 

One key insight is that the following three paths  will naturally lead to the circular economy

1. Passion (as herself)
2. Ultra efficient engineering design 
3. Ultra high quality engineering 


I wonder if the decentralized managed supply chain we are setting up within the EcoVerse21 project right now if allowed to continuously evolve as how the DAO has been will eventually evolve to become circular too.
[5/13/23, 3:43:33 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we may want to consider starting with a small nonprofit

[5/13/23, 3:44:32 PM] Tess walkowski: How efficient is the cacao
[5/13/23, 3:44:40 PM] Gary Teh: I think we should just validate the viability of the whole supply chain model first before sinking any further resources into building it out 🤔

What really reasonated allowing potential customers and suppliers to find the project and get it off the ground.
[5/14/23, 8:38:22 AM] Gary Teh: @436602040200 have you implemented your research methodology in an tangible form anywhere yet? 🙂
[5/14/23, 8:41:51 AM] Gary Teh: What were the outcomes?
[5/14/23, 8:41:54 AM] Paul: We started with the first projects on ... www.simplytokenized.com ... 
It still has the old design, which we used for testing the market. 
By the end of Q2/23 we will be live with a complete redesign
[5/14/23, 8:42:26 AM] Paul: The whole paper is based on a phd I am working on
[5/14/23, 8:44:42 AM] Gary Teh: Are you responsible for driving the investors or are the project leaders responsible for that?

Cause if it’s the latter than almost no differentiation from what is already out there 

In that regard @33652866472 approach might be more effective
[5/14/23, 8:45:32 AM] Paul: @33652866472 can you share your approach?

[5/14/23, 8:48:23 AM] Gary Teh: From the perspective of the two projects our guilds are building, we are potentially looking at fundraising via the sales of NFTs which come with very specific utilities associated with those projects once we have tested the initial prototype and are ready to take in additional fundings to scale up those projects 

Since it’s fundraising via NFTs, opensea has the most liquidity so we might end up opting for that route
[5/14/23, 8:51:10 AM] Gary Teh: What is not clear though is how algorithms surface those NFTs on the opensea platform
[5/14/23, 8:57:27 AM] Paul: Till 2019 I was managing partner of a big crowdinvesting platform in central europe. My experience was, that we always needed the project lead to be responsible. Otherwise, promoting a project without the active inclusion of the project lead never worked for us.   As a platform we could only increase the results by using the platform community.
[5/14/23, 9:02:01 AM] Suheil z: we will need to make some heavy offline community building for powerful exposure, their algorithm is not far from how social's "stand alone" doesnt create enoough exposure
[5/14/23, 9:03:29 AM] Suheil z: social's , "stand alone"....
[5/14/23, 9:04:42 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. That seems like it’s going to involve alot of effort

Might make sense to activate that route for crowd funding if and when we want to take on the importing and distribution of an entire cargo container of cacao 🤩
[5/14/23, 9:05:47 AM] Gary Teh: Right now first iteration 100kg of cacao
[5/14/23, 9:06:03 AM] Suheil z: dont worry ii see a strong based community oon whatsapp, strategies 101 of community building are on me the rest is following the wave ;p
[5/14/23, 9:06:10 AM] Gary Teh: We have enough funds for that internally within our DAO’s vault

[5/14/23, 9:38:16 AM] Tess walkowski: I thought of farmers markets we do where it's trade only
[5/14/23, 9:51:47 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: many people understand circular economy as a kind of waste management. however, the goal must be to design new products in such a way that they never become waste. for example, that only healthy and degradable materials or materials that can be kept free of toxins in the technical cycle are used. humans and their creation are at the centre of this. in this way, we can organise our economic activity and our consumption in the same way as all animals on this planet do. In harmony with nature.
[5/14/23, 9:52:09 AM] Tess walkowski: You would love plastic beach
[5/14/23, 9:52:50 AM] Tess walkowski: I made lamps from bottles, the big principle was that I did not make them unrecyclable
[5/14/23, 9:53:22 AM] Tess walkowski: For under $300 investment plastic bottles become beautiful durable waste
[5/14/23, 9:54:56 AM] Tess walkowski: These ideas are important to me! And personally I want to see this play a roll in as the dao launches

But there are legal efforts in the European Green Deal to move away from toxic materials. That is a real milestone. The industry must search for solutions at full speed.
[5/14/23, 12:43:26 PM] Gary Teh: It’s going to be very disruptive industry wise once the green deal comes into effect

[5/15/23, 1:28:35 AM] Gary Teh: I wonder if there might be a Darwinian evolutionary aspects to this from a risk management perspective 

Route 1: The whole extended family putting their eggs in one basket, if it fails, the entire family gets wiped out

Route 2: The individuals within the family go in separate directions, if one member fails, he is dispensable and experiences biological death. Other members discover something viable and the rest of the tribe (less one dead member) prospers. Or perhaps the whole tribe gets wiped out and the one survivor who discovers something viable continues the gene pool

Bulk of the modern day Singaporean Chinese are descendents of migrants who opted to up and leave their ancestral land at some point (route 2) during to civil war during the Qing dynasty
[5/15/23, 2:14:30 AM] Tiff Tiff: Nice one. Our approach at Phoenix Acceleration is to use a techstack and team of 50 to map immediate networks, target the ideal investors in there for the offering and then personally arrange 1on1 introductions to the investors at scale ; 5-10 warm intros weekly. This usually makes sense for raises of $2M+
[5/15/23, 2:15:09 AM] Tiff Tiff: We can also do the entire investment representation from first call to close as a regulated consortium

[5/15/23, 2:41:40 AM] Francois renet: Also, and I speak for France but sure it goes beyond, underpaid staff who just don’t care about service or maintenance. That problem is much more difficult to solve as engagement is a top to bottom issue. Poop trickles down.
[5/15/23, 2:42:01 AM] Gary Teh: Mind sharing the level of performance these projects are already executing at before they approach you? And are they generally social
Impact focused projects or fall under other categories?

These are the ones I utilize to access general early stage projects

- team configuration stats is 
- market opportunity identification status
- prototype status
- traction status
- revenue growth status
[5/15/23, 2:44:08 AM] Gary Teh: You almost need an impactful external event that destroys a whole bunch of existing infrastructure so that participants don’t have to worry about legacy systems to cause a transition 

For example Elon musk acquiring Twitter and immediately laying off 85% of the staff
[5/15/23, 2:47:38 AM] Francois renet: AI and robots replacing personnel. There was an interesting interview on the BBC this morning with Sit Sorrell about a new law the Labour Party wants to introduce that would forbid management to contact their employees on weekends and at night. He made the correlation about the potential storm that would make it difficult for employers to conduct business with more stringent labor laws when AI solutions are available to replace humans.

[5/15/23, 3:03:05 AM] Gary Teh: I observe factions within an organization tends to form once a “correct” way of doing things (culture) has crystallized within a sub-set of participants. 

Inter faction conflict starts intensifying when the competing culture attempt to dictate on the “correct” way of doing things

There was a business case study about the Port Authority of Singapore in the 90s when they decided to modernize/digitize which I came across back in the university 

The government issued the mandate to digitize. The head of departments (HODs) at first resisted. After a period of small scale trial testing and scaling within selected departments, The executive team finally gave the HODs the notice to either transit or get replaced. (Their way of removing factions)

As a source of psychological comfort the HODs were for a while running parallel systems. Printing documents off the system which had zero value whatever so to the overall process 

Ultimately, the transition was successfully completed. Sea freight turn around time at the port dropped from 5 days to 30 minutes
[5/15/23, 4:25:38 AM] Tiff Tiff: I second that
[5/15/23, 6:51:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Family is very important to the indigenous.     I do feel rootless without.
[5/15/23, 6:57:44 AM] Tess walkowski: The three year old didn't talk not a word. He had a machete. He did work. At 3 making fire and chopping. There is no word for thank you. No word for please.
[5/15/23, 7:01:57 AM] Tess walkowski: Capitalism drove mothers out of the home and turned families into consumers.  We didn't have grocery stores as we know them. Actually one of the first ones in the world was in Henry Switzerland Collier opened it shortly after his chocolate factory ( using nestles milk)  this was also when pharma or farma began....bc Collier was you guessed it a pharmacist
[5/15/23, 7:04:13 AM] Tess walkowski: We talked at the trading post store yesterday.  It was the process of colonization where they flipped the cropps cacao to Africa and coffee to South America where it is not native.

[5/15/23, 7:14:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Elon needs a hug and a cacao ceremony and he needs roots too....his roots are decayed....he's a smart man genius level,  but he operates from ego, which leads to the brain shooting chemicals which are just like drugs further sticking him to his ego
[5/15/23, 7:16:26 AM] Tess walkowski: Staff at whole foods amazons had ideations after six months of pandemic work... we were going dark and had to help each other.  Some of the best people I ever worked with were there. Hard workers. Smart people.  If we had owned that store....imagine
[5/15/23, 2:50:56 PM] Alessandro Mele: We have been working with an external partner so there is a fee sharing arrangement. We have also done some consulting work to support with business model and investor deck. Our consulting fees are paid part up front and part upon fund raising for a total of £25k. We also help with investor introductions and that is paid 6% on capital raised. Finally we have a legal provision that allows us to convert part of the success fees in shares of the company either at this round or the next.
[5/15/23, 2:52:57 PM] Alessandro Mele: We typically agree terms with clients on a case by case basis depending on the gaps we see in their investor readiness, size of the transaction, whether a lead investor has already been found, stage of development to name a few
[5/15/23, 3:08:21 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! What’s the typical amount you help them raise? 🙂🙏
[5/15/23, 3:16:16 PM] Alessandro Mele: Varies a lot, for companies we look for raises of at least 5m and series A and B (post prof of concept and with TRACTION 😉)
[5/15/23, 3:16:54 PM] Alessandro Mele: And we work as a combined team with the client, providing our experience and expertise to manage professionally the fund raising process
[5/15/23, 3:20:21 PM] Alessandro Mele: We have in the past raised all of the raise or a portion from our investor network, other times we have not been successful - for instance for a clean tech start up we are struggling as they are pre-revenue, capital intensive and their technology is disrupting the renewable energy market so most investors are staying away. So we need to be creative and persistent in looking for potential investors who can take these risks
[5/15/23, 3:20:45 PM] Alessandro Mele: Every project is different
[5/15/23, 4:48:36 PM] Gary Teh: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing! 🤩

The deliberate streamlining of guild membership size within our DAO based around the two pizza team rule has the counter intuitive effect of boosting execution effectiveness

By sticking to the two pizza rule and then applying the additional rule that Fara utilized to up keep the quality of his community (removing systematically disinviting the least relevant member whenever a new one seeks to join), people remaining in the guild chatrooms know very clearly why they are still there and how they are supposed to contribute.
Distractions and confusion are this minimalized.

[5/19/23, 10:28:00 AM] Gary Teh: It is quite similar to the advice @14806488258 always gave when we were on the hiring committee together in the previous company. "Always seek to bring onboard a new colleague whom you feel you will be happy to give up your current job position for"

In this case, we turned it into a rule and systematically apply it in our DAO.

[5/21/23, 9:00:28 AM] Suheil z: is there anyone by coincidence that can hook us up with entrance to this conference : https://www.changenow.world/join_changenow_2023/?utm_source=Display&utm_medium=digital+display&utm_campaign=Search-CN23&utm_id=CN23&gclid=CjwKCAjwgqejBhBAEiwAuWHioJJIUjELl6_RR6zlovTZ_Wr0m3IRaVBh99W5si_z5dTWawklnax_yBoCn1wQAvD_BwE
[5/21/23, 9:01:12 AM] Suheil z: it s very crucial to represent TrueSight DAO in such places and i am hunting couple of profiles that will be there for our DAO's missiion :D
[5/21/23, 9:27:28 AM] Tess walkowski: True sight now needs LinkedIn love too.
[5/21/23, 9:28:10 AM] Tess walkowski: Sorry I'm not on the ball right now.  Heat exhaustion.   Sitting with my phone right now. Making a plan to get out of this.
[5/21/23, 9:30:21 AM] Gary Teh: Please take care 🙂🙏
[5/21/23, 9:31:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Thanks. It's rough. I have Pedialyte.  I'm holding still and will find another apartment and go soon.

[5/21/23, 10:28:56 AM] Tess walkowski: I'm gonna teach him cacao ceremony
[5/21/23, 10:29:10 AM] Tess walkowski: It's not fair that only white people do this.
[5/21/23, 10:29:30 AM] Tess walkowski: He's half kicked out anyway from his tribe.  We may have to adopt him.
[5/21/23, 11:20:54 AM] Alessandro Mele: Let me check I have a couple of connections to the founder
[5/21/23, 1:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: Thank you brother 🙂🙏
[5/21/23, 2:42:56 PM] Suheil z: yesterday we were hanging out with alex co founder of tornedo cash who was jailed in holland..... while our night the following happened 
https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/21/attacker-takes-over-tornado-cash-dao-with-vote-fraud-token-slumps-40/

how they got screwed ? simply because of Human neglection ..... hackers sent a self destrructing code to their network that got replaced by a code that stole 40% of the DAO's network....
[5/21/23, 2:43:01 PM] Suheil z: amazing lessons to learn from ;0=)

[5/22/23, 1:59:59 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps to better tap into the strength of our network if you could provide visibility into the following questions more might be able to help 

1. What category of profiles are you hunting for?

2. How do you foresee these profiles contributing to our DAO (roles they will play)?
[5/22/23, 2:02:26 AM] Suheil z: 1. philanthropist, Public office (i know de facto that the boss from Hague municipality responsible about iniicubating NGO's is there hhh) and many similar
[5/22/23, 2:02:49 AM] Suheil z: tech start ups that benefiit building our tech environment
[5/22/23, 2:03:05 AM] Suheil z: actually at this stage it is all about dispersing the word
[5/22/23, 2:04:04 AM] Suheil z: to many different type of personalities... the way ii see it , we need academics to support frrom research point of view, we need political sscience people to help build sustainable governance, we need deep tech to help build SECURE tech environment ...ect ect ect
[5/22/23, 3:06:40 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/22/23, 3:07:45 AM] Gary Teh: Do you think it might make sense to first have a roadmap and the roles we need at various stages of the roadmap? 

That way, when we engages with these folks they will know clearly where they fit in in the grander scheme of things as well as how they will be expected to contribute? And most importantly their ability and willingness to contribute within that defined scope

Based on what we observed last one and a half year, inviting folks into our DAO without providing them a clear view of how they are expected to contribute immediately just leaves them hanging and disengaged. 

In some cases when the values and vision are clearly not aligned, we observed clearly disruptive behaviors exhibited by these participants in our DAO 🙂

[5/22/23, 3:37:38 AM] Gary Teh: One thing that becomes very apparent after looking back at historical data recorded on our ledger as well as memories of conversations we had with prospective contributors, is that moment of “spark” where there is light in their eyes

From my perspective this translates to

“This DAO’s purpose, mission and core values deeply resonates with who I am (my identity). I have basically found my tribe and I am going to contribute towards its mission so as to actualize its vision.”

From that point onwards contributing time and effort in exchange for governance tokens (thus voting rights) in our DAO just becomes as natural as breathing air 

The follow up tell tale sign of whether we are speaking to a missionary or a mercenary is if the prospect we are speaking with is going to ask for fiat. If they do, then they clearly fall under the mercenary category. We can circle back to them at a later date but we should prioritize our time in finding other missionaries for our DAO 🙂🙏

[5/22/23, 8:56:32 AM] Tess walkowski: What's that
[5/22/23, 9:08:23 AM] Gary Teh: The beginnings of a new shiitake mushroom network
[5/22/23, 9:09:26 AM] Tess walkowski: My Michigan friends are shroomers

[5/22/23, 9:25:52 AM] Gary Teh: They should know the importance of up keeping the culture then.

Mushroom culture cultivation requires a lot of attention to removing contamination when they are sighted otherwise the entire batch (sometimes warehouse) needs to get tossed
[5/22/23, 9:26:16 AM] Gary Teh: I am aware that @19209806391 is right now setting up such a facility in Michigan
[5/22/23, 9:27:43 AM] Tess walkowski: Hiring? Got shrooms? I need shrooms! Do you know my friends.  I want mushrooms in my cacao!
[5/22/23, 9:28:31 AM] Tess walkowski: Yeah they have been doing this for a while.   Not always for sale we inoculate wild
[5/22/23, 9:28:45 AM] Gary Teh: I think he is just cultivating regular commercial mushrooms which he plans to distribute to the local restaurants
[5/22/23, 9:29:40 AM] Tess walkowski: I have a source for magic ones I need shitake and Chaga and turkey tail.

They set the cacao commodity price here and force it on the local producers, extracting the bulk of the profit for themselves in the process. 

The poverty here in the streets is just painful to observe. 

A successful initial transaction by us on behalf of the coop will represent a crack in this yoke the cartel has imposed on the locals. 

What we will need to focus on next is to continue working on the crack until the yoke eventually shatters 🤩

[6/5/23, 3:53:31 AM] Johnny Browaeys: ok thank yuou
[6/5/23, 9:39:23 AM] Gary Teh: TrueSight DAO is essentially a meta-game where players contribute their expertise to our collective efforts in exchange for governance tokens in our DAO

The mission is to create profitable blockchain enabled businesses that are operated and ran by the crowd to displace exploitative practices in various industries 

The belief is that through our efforts we will displace these exploitative practices with our successful businesses thereby restoring social and environmental Justice 

Our purpose and vision is a better world based on verifiable truth. 

We are open to accepting missionaries in our guilds. contributors who are willing to exchange their effort for governance tokens 

Mercenaries, folks who want fiat in exchange for their efforts, have no business in this DAO. 

In fact, I would strongly encourage them to leave right now so as not pollute our culture 🙂🙏

The roadmap for the Ecoverse project that the guild is working on is documented here 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper 

Also included as part of the roadmap is where blockchain and tokenization starts getting introduced to further scale things 

@32487258073 I understand from @8618926086648 you are in the cacao industry
[6/6/23, 4:01:40 AM] Gary Teh: @16513008789 some aspects of the white paper where we figure out how to legally account for the flow of funds from DAO and back to finance the shipments might be interesting discussion to be had with you

[6/7/23, 7:02:12 AM] Iwona Fluda: Hello Beer Hall Community!

I'm reaching out on behalf of two friends who are actively looking for promising startup investment opportunities. Here are some specifics about the type of startups they are interested in:

👉🏻 They should already have some level of proven success, either in terms of revenue generation or evident traction (such as signed contracts or a growing user base).
👉🏻 They operate within certain industries: AI, cleantech, FinTech, MedTech, and mobility are of particular interest.
👉🏻 They are currently seeking substantial financial investment to fuel their growth.

If your startup fits (or you know any startup that does fit) these criteria and you're in search of an investor, you know now where to find me! 🌟 😃 Cheers!
[6/7/23, 7:04:09 AM] Tres Garcia: Are the investors US or foreign based?
[6/7/23, 7:04:37 AM] Iwona Fluda: Swiss-based investing in businesses globally.
[6/7/23, 11:53:22 AM] Tiff Tiff: What's the minimum ticket? Are they interested in financial returns only or social and environmental equally?
[6/7/23, 11:55:20 AM] Tiff Tiff: I might have 5-6 for ya
[6/7/23, 12:17:47 PM] Iwona Fluda: Hi! Thanks for your question, Tif! All the SDGs can be a topic as long as the other points are fulfilled. 
The smallest ticket is 1 Mio.

This is an annual gathering of the 200 largest cacao producers here in Brazil. 

The goal of the speech is to share the roadmap for our collaboration leading up to the actualization of the Cacao Coin 

The cooperative is meanwhile helping make introductions to their contacts in the cacao industry in the Dominican Republic which I will be arriving at on 14th June later this month

[6/8/23, 2:04:54 PM] Gary Teh: Via this route the project becomes a joint venture between a few organizations, one of them being our soon to be incorporated Swiss association. 

So the Swiss association is in essence an early investor of the project

[6/8/23, 2:14:54 PM] Gary Teh: My sense (based on what I have been observing historically) is lots of folks will start privately expressing their own opinions one way or the other as soon as the first pilot test has been successfully conducted

Please don’t feel slighted if we hit that stage and I am not as responsive to you privately as you would have hoped (I am probably overwhelmed with these private one on one messages at that point and need to prioritize the use of time)

Success breeds more attention and engagement. Failure just breeds a lack of interest
[6/8/23, 4:33:01 PM] Gary Teh: In case the Swiss association doesn’t get incorporated in time (needs 35K Swiss francs) if we decided this route is a third option 

I have seen this done before via the form of investment syndicates in traditional tech startups 

Only one person’s name appears on the cap table of the incorporated entity

But there is a side agreement signed between syndicate members where the shares issued to the individual are allocated to the members of the syndicate 

In this case the counter party to the syndicate agreement will be TrueSight DAO. 

Once the Swiss association is incorporated, the shares will be transferred to the association and the name of the individual on the Cap table will be replaced by the official name of the Swiss association

That exercise will start as soon as the summer solistice (21st June) once the new set of governors are rotation into position by the algorithm 🙂🙏
[6/9/23, 7:27:06 AM] Gary Teh: As part of the exercise governors rotated in by the algorithm who are not able to undertake the responsibility will be replaced by manually nominated and elected members who can
[6/9/23, 7:27:54 AM] Gary Teh: Term of governorship will thereafter increase to a minimum of 1 year
[6/9/23, 7:30:05 AM] Iwona Fluda: How many board members are you searching for?
[6/9/23, 7:44:13 AM] Gary Teh: 9 or 11 board members from amongst the general assembly members (governance token holders)

I believe @972509342179 is doing the same right now

@918017107841 has done something already via the assembly of a grant list 

It will be helpful if we can assemble a package  from what is already out there that we can just tap on to finance the efforts of cooperatives who want to get their facilities and produce certified for exports to the US government or simply allowed for exports  

That way we can just simply deploy the necessary package and then load them on top agroverse network

[6/12/23, 6:56:12 PM] Gary Teh: After much research, if and when we decide to bring more cooperatives on to the agroverse network unless they already qualified for importing into the USA, we will need to expend fiat capital to help qualify them and their products for import into the USA. 

I was sharing with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 today it makes sense to just setup relationships now with these cooperatives we plan to onboard but the actual onboarding will only happen once we generate enough fiat via existing trade routes to finance the onboarding of more cooperative partners onto the network
[6/12/23, 7:03:01 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/12/23, 7:47:52 PM] Gary Teh: To secure the compounding effect of the network generated via our deployment of fiat to onboard of these cooperative partners, we will sign exclusive distribution rights agreement with them for the USA market

Otherwise we do not recoup our fiat capital injection back and our network fails as liquidity dries up due to pipeline leakage
[6/12/23, 9:24:11 PM] Johnny Browaeys: nice to see your amazing network as always @8618926086648  - here is the profile of Ivan Leku, a reliable hard working friend i know from my time in Uganda - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-leku-6537446a/ - his uncle is the former ambassador of Uganda to China and his family is in fact the descendant from the royal family from Uganda (but no longer ruling the coutry)

But note there are no expert in anything related to the topics discussed here - you can also consider them as reliable connections in Uganda if you need any
[6/12/23, 9:40:19 PM] Johnny Browaeys: are any of these in China? I am particularly interested in learning about the latest there. During my assignment with Yara in 2021 I dug a bit deeper in China's agricultural development and noticed a lot going on around ecosystems and value chains being built, and how blockchain was an enabler for this, the concept of GEP was particularly interesting: Gross Ecosystem Production, which allows to turn individual players that are hard to invest (eg. an AI company that improves cameras in drones to spot and address plant diseases) into an an easily investible ecosystem that includes the whole value chain from land to crop to farmer to harvesting to logistics to e-commerce to the cities and including finance and insurance - all in line with the goals of the central plan economy and therefore supported (the basket of eggs I mentioned above)

[6/13/23, 7:05:22 AM] Gary Teh: That would be wonderful! Once we trade route between Brazil and US is flowing smoothly. trade routes like those between Uganda and USA becomes really interesting to consider 

This is especially after observing that the monthly expected consumption volume is much higher than the monthly production volume of each of these locations
[6/13/23, 7:08:16 AM] Gary Teh: After studying this space Approaching the relevant cooperatives in the area as opposed to individual farmers makes better sense 

This is since the cooperatives are made up of these farmers and a very convenient aggregation point for the deployment of capital. 

Based on my conversations with representatives of the cooperatives a lot of the RnD happen at that layer and are then transmitted to individual farms by frequent visits of cooperative representatives to the farms 

Farmers are generally too engross in the day to day to undertake any form of RnD themselves
[6/13/23, 7:35:49 AM] Gary Teh: To ensure we are engaging with the right type of cooperative as opposed to “middlemen” masking as cooperative it is important to check their governance 

A physical visit to their location to have a conversation with cooperative members and then visits to their facilities and farms to talk to members operating at the different layers will provide that required level of visibility prior to capital deployment
[6/13/23, 7:37:07 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 if he so decides to go to cities where these cooperatives are based will be helpful for the initial handshake and relationship establishment between the representatives of these cooperatives and TrueSight DAO

Then we can slowly onboard them onto the agroverse network

[6/13/23, 4:28:04 PM] Gary Teh: The president of the Brazilian cooperative has reached out today asking if we knew about a potential buyer from USA. 

Seems we both agree the natural order of things once our infrastructure is setup is for us to handle the importing and then the distribution to companies from Northern America keen in buying produce from the cooperative 

Have spoken with @554884640132 along with @5491125130580 and @554888644380 prior to my departure to start Investigating what is required in terms of infrastructure to be able to start importing products from Northern America into Brazil. This is to handle the request for medical supplies imports 

Ideally when the two way trade routes are setup between north and South America, we minimize the need to transfer funds between the bank accounts in Brazil and USA as trade volumes stay balanced
[6/13/23, 5:49:44 PM] Dragon - Florianopolis: Hey guys, i have made a decision.

I understand your hedge fund facility runs a trading strategy with a sharpe ratio of 5

What would be interesting from our perspective would be if there was a way to ride on top of your facility to multiply the funds sitting in these two bank accounts as well as those sitting in our vault but have them rapidly freed up as and when liquidity is required to finance the shipments

That was something that ChatGpt proposed when I was exploring into the holdings structure the other day

[6/14/23, 5:32:25 AM] Gary Teh: Very wonderful share the speaker touched upon a lot of the issues we considered at when attempting to actualize our purpose of “Building a better world based on verifiable Truth” 

During our attempts we realized there were actually two classes of problems 

Class 1: marketing is desirable while accountability and transparency is not necessarily desirable for the producers generating the resource / content / service and they do not see value in paying for accountability and transparency in one form or another 

Class 2: marketing is desirable. accountability and transparency is a core part of the marketing for producers generating the resource / content / service and they were willing to pay for the accountability and transparency in one form or another 

Earlier we committed the mistake 3 times of attempting to solve problems from class 1. 

    - fake news (project: Edgar v1)
    - fake trading signals (project: market monocle)
    - web3 scams (project: cypher defense) 


Agroverse is probably the first time we landed correctly upon a Class 2 problem. The producers see a lot of value promoting accountability and transparency as it directly helps with their product differentiation and marketing efforts 

Given that we are DAO and resources contributed by members is strictly voluntary base, I feel it is important we direct them towards problems where market participants are receptive to our efforts as opposed to being apathetic or downright hostile. 

This allows us the ability to tap on one of the primary cognitive bias that makes us human (social reciprocity bias) and turn it into a virtuous cycle  

Recognition of our efforts by producers encourage and energize DAo members to want to contribute more and that in turns energize producers to want to support our efforts even more. And meanwhile real social and economic value is generated to sustain the producers, our DAO members and the consumers at large 

We end up with a win win win dynamic ( aka triple bottom line)
[6/14/23, 5:52:59 AM] Gary Teh: Seems like @41799155602 pre-empted my thoughts 

Members of Brazilian cooperative mentioned about the desire to eventually float a cacao coin when we get the legal, logistic and tech layer of our long term collaboration in place

[6/16/23, 4:54:32 AM] Suheil - Europe: She will get very happy seeing this appreciation :D
[6/16/23, 4:54:54 AM] Suheil - Europe: Real artist values appreciation more than stupid fiat currency payment ;)

[6/16/23, 9:15:33 AM] Gary Teh: Had a very productive 30 minutes discussion just now between me, @31641075825 and @4915785523192 where we walked through our server needs to facilitate the migration our servers over to the OVH, to leverage the credits provided by their acceleration program. 

The credits for the acceleration program will become available as soon as our Swiss association is setup.

[6/17/23, 7:19:09 AM] Gary Teh: I was just rethinking through the fiat currency fundraising and injection route into our ecosystem 

Raised capital sits within TrueTech Inc (holding bay) and is only recognized as injected into a guild project (or our DAO) when expenses are paid using those funds. 

Via this route, there is no sale of tokens. This avoids transgressing SEC regulations. 

When TrueTech Inc pays for expenses incurred during the execution of our roadmap, These expenses are recognized as operating expenses of the company when yearly tax reports are filed with the US government. 

Meanwhile, TrueTech Inc gets awarded governance tokens by TrueSight DAO for contributing to the payment of these expenses that are much needed for execution of TrueSight DAO roadmap

Folks who injected capital in TrueTech Inc only control voting rights of the governance tokens awarded so far to TrueTech Inc by our DAO
 
This ends up forming two parallel accounting system for the same exact set of financial transactions. One reported to the US government to remain compliant, the other that controls the award of DAO governance tokens (and voting rights)

The side effect of this approach is the traditional that “pump and dump” schemes prevalent in the web3 space are by default not possible. That helps to filter out folks who are not aligned with our DAO’s core values

A lot of capital can be raised by TrueTech Inc but not yield any increase in the net book value of our governance tokens (total fiat assets in our treasury versus total governance tokens issued thus far for contributions made)

The performance of our governance tokens’ net book value is purely merit based and dependent on the profits generated from commercial activities in our various guilds 

Via this structure the option to raise fiat capital to help finance our DAO’s projects via uncapped SAFE also becomes available.

[6/19/23, 2:02:38 AM] Francois renet: By 2030 half their revenue has to be non tobacco related. As an FYI. I’m actually working with one of them to convert e-cigarettes into “epicenter” for asthmatics. Replaced the nicotine cartridge with Ventolin for micro particle absorption by the lungs in more efficient way than the pumps. Lots of opportunities there!

[6/19/23, 4:19:21 AM] Gary Teh: Simple question: if that opportunity is associated with some form of social or environmental injustice and will it boost the net book value of our governance tokens within the next 365 days if we pursue it by creating a guild within our DAO? 

If the answer is yes, then we should definitely share it here 🤩

If not share it in the Do Nothing Society 🙂

[6/19/23, 11:53:33 AM] Gary Teh: Me and @18298364965 had an amazing meeting session with Pila the president of the association here.

This association is one of 26 that is part of Coopnacado cooperative’s eastern district here in the Dominican Republic 

She walked us through their cacao process 

Later this week me and @18298364965 are looking forward to visiting their head office to liaise with their sales office as well as other partner companies we will need help with 

@554792626338 is helping set that up 🤩👍

[6/20/23, 8:34:10 AM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: for the cacao I think they have a reserve of it cause they have to be ready for that
[6/20/23, 8:34:33 AM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: in the est in the 26 cacao home I think they have something in this care

[6/20/23, 6:55:35 PM] Gary Teh: You might want to communicate that this might potentially be the start of a new project that seeks to address social injustice in the hospitality industry. And, if the stars align, will end up resulting in the forming of new guild within our DAO governed using the same set of rubrics we are right now using in our DAO.

However discussions are still in the early stages and the outcome dependent on conversations that will be had with other potential ecosystem partners to determine their ability and willingness to collaborate and what they want in return for their resource inputs. 🙂🙏
[6/20/23, 7:28:15 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I wanted to build a tens unit today bc i don't have money but My 555 chip is in usa lol
[6/20/23, 7:28:45 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It sounds awesome but París flights
[6/20/23, 7:29:07 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Don't know how to hack anything other than electrónicos and cacao
[6/20/23, 7:44:58 PM] Gary Teh: Electronic hacking is really cool! 🤩

What type of electronic hacking do you do?

Do you do breadboard and soldering as well?

Might come in useful for apartment management
[6/20/23, 7:54:58 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Yeah the basics. Apartment management?
[6/20/23, 7:55:31 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Yeah today i wanted to build a tens unit bc electricista stimulates bone growth
[6/20/23, 7:56:55 PM] Gary Teh: Build out electronics, installed to control access to various apartments 

When a person wants to enter an apartment, he needs to flash his phone to a physical reader that you built 

If the phone’s wallet contains enough tokens, the owner is granted access to the apartment
[6/20/23, 7:57:22 PM] Gary Teh: The token balance is automatically deducted from the wallet installed on the phone
[6/20/23, 7:58:05 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : That sounds a bit like dystopia but it works
[6/20/23, 7:59:06 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It's gonna be a similar thing compsnies drswing schematics and outsourcing

[6/26/23, 7:02:24 PM] Gary Teh: @573136732781 let’s explore how you see this activity you are proposing benefiting the net book value of our governance tokens 🙂🙏
[6/26/23, 7:03:23 PM] Gary Teh: Happy to extend our rubric for this once we have more visibility

It’s similar to what @31641075825 exploring right now with the hospitality industry
[6/26/23, 7:03:35 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : And as soon as Amazon is ready i can put up an affiliate link for it
[6/26/23, 7:04:09 PM] Gary Teh: Got it. So basically you are proposing to come up with various contents on how to utilize the cacaos we make available
[6/26/23, 7:04:10 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It crosses over i am hospitality
[6/26/23, 7:04:18 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Yes
[6/26/23, 7:04:26 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Body scrub and bar
[6/26/23, 7:05:25 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I'm pitching a bar to a friend who is in a Miami market with the criolla to help kogi
[6/26/23, 7:06:59 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Derivative products using the cacao we bring in to USA.
[6/26/23, 7:32:00 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Yeah and i can add an affiliate link to Amazon
[6/26/23, 7:33:11 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I Will have market for criolla from here, but i can offer cheaper alternatives.   My sales are small.
[6/26/23, 7:35:18 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I Will start to do ceremonias and partner with other makers to sell cacao and related stuff

[6/26/23, 7:53:24 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : More when i turn it to chocolate
[6/26/23, 7:55:14 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It's high. But money for tribes.  And i don't really want to sell.... I want to hold ceremony and eat it.
[6/26/23, 7:55:45 PM] Gary Teh: So price includes attending the cacao ceremony you are conducting??
[6/26/23, 7:56:04 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : No.
[6/26/23, 7:56:51 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Ceremony ideal day rate plus flight
[6/26/23, 7:57:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I would charge minimum $20 sliding scale ceremony a person local
[6/26/23, 7:59:07 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Medicina isnt always about money, and it depends what type i do
[6/26/23, 8:00:52 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Production / bartend day rate is $350 - $500 SO k would charge that as a starting base
[6/26/23, 8:02:14 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Ritual.
[6/26/23, 8:02:28 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I think i prefer that Word.
[6/26/23, 8:03:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : A cacao ritual can be anything.  Any excuse to celebrate with cacao.   Yes sound healing. Breath work. Meditation.  Dance. Hapeh.  All good.
[6/26/23, 8:04:18 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : But it can also just be cacao and code. Rituales help us create and come together.
[6/26/23, 8:05:21 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I AM also making mexican cacao with it.   Mexicans eat cacao all the time and don't call it ceremony :)

[6/26/23, 8:32:52 PM] Gary Teh: Still not seeing very clearly yet

Haven’t had the chance to attend any cacao ceremonies myself

Will have more visibility once I get the chance to attend cacao ceremonies conducted by at least 3 different shamans

My sense is the triangulation of the qualitative data gathered from these three events  gathered will provide the necessary insight on how the tokenomics for this portion of the ecosystem will work 🙂
[6/27/23, 5:32:27 AM] Gary Teh: Anyone wants to join me to do the “Read 132 pages of FDA labeling guidelines” challenge?

[6/27/23, 5:53:19 AM] Gary Teh: More as I dig further and further into the domain, getting familiar with law and regulations to get stuff done in the real world feels a lot like programming using a bunch of software libraries that are open source

[6/28/23, 12:55:49 PM] Arti - Berkeley: I would be careful at mentioning weight loss as the primary sell, many people don't want to lose weight, and it could be triggering for someone with body image issues or EDs, perhaps a more holistic approach to wellness without considering weight or diets could be the focus 🙂
[6/28/23, 12:57:08 PM] Arti - Berkeley: A keto diet is also not the best diet to follow for some people, so I would be careful with advertising that 🙂
[6/28/23, 12:58:40 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: arti great think but the good question is are we going to sell to one specific direction for this tipe of need or is general selling?
[6/28/23, 12:59:31 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: cause if we sell for every one arti is rights we need different type of pack for every different type os buyers
[6/28/23, 1:12:22 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I think we can improve the copy as well.  I also AM not sure we áre "organic"
[6/28/23, 1:12:39 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Being more general could be good
[6/28/23, 1:14:21 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: organic is quality
[6/28/23, 1:14:50 PM] Ferdinando - General Manager Boninelli - Dominican Republic: %99
[6/28/23, 1:15:14 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : To label organic it has to pass usda inspection and labeling
[6/28/23, 1:16:01 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Yeah it's "organic" but we can't call it that, as far as i understand

[6/28/23, 1:24:16 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Perhaps if we had keto and paleo strong on the front
[6/28/23, 1:25:03 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Keto. Paleo. Nutrient rich.  Vegan. Organic.
[6/28/23, 1:26:35 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Not sure we can Say "may have an effect on insulin resistance" not on package .....
[6/28/23, 1:27:16 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s not do that.

[6/28/23, 1:28:28 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : If i sell natural health stuff i can't Say "this helps your stomach" i have to Say "herbs work different for everyone"

[6/28/23, 1:30:09 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Paleo on front consumer doesnt have to think
[6/28/23, 1:30:33 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Paleo has no dairy or egg
[6/28/23, 1:31:05 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Many keto people quit.... But still use the principales
[6/28/23, 1:31:36 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I personally know i can eat anything which is paleo
[6/28/23, 1:31:46 PM] Gary Teh: Wasting real estate on the package 

The correlations to sales was weak when we did the multilinear regression analysis
[6/28/23, 1:32:56 PM] Gary Teh: Can sprinkle it in the product listing page. But correlation is still weak. No much effect on keyword optimization
[6/28/23, 1:33:14 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Feature the Word keto on the front ?

[6/28/23, 4:47:28 PM] Gary Teh: At some stage we definitely should. It will cost us/them a fraction to bank on the upside and protect the downside. 

I doubt they are familiar, but I’m sure their chain of clients are.

It depends on the quantity we can gather and the type of commodity to be delivered: cocoa vs. cacao…
[6/28/23, 4:49:09 PM] Gary Teh: Futures contracts are generally tools used to even out the price of a commodity in the future

Especially useful for the manufacturers further down the value chain

In this case, it’s applicable to us. Every spike like this that you just shared eats into our DAO’s profit margin

[6/28/23, 4:51:13 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective since we are unlike other retailers without significant amount of fix overheads

Whenever macro environment become unfavorable if we are not future hedge, we can always opt to not have any of our inventory supply available for sale to end consumer
[6/28/23, 4:52:43 PM] Gary Teh: If end consumers really are that addicted to their cacaos, they could always choose to pre-purchase their supplies from us. That forms the basis of our futures market 🤣

[6/28/23, 5:02:13 PM] Gary Teh: It’s always nice to have conceptually cool and fun ideas

But personally most just gets discarded after getting all the numbers and plotting them on an excel sheet. 

Around 99% of Conceptually cool and fun ideas just turn out to be ideas with really bad economics once you collected enough data and run a 5 year projection using an excel
sheet. 

But that 1%. Those are the home runs 🤩
[6/28/23, 5:02:28 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I do want land to farm. We farm together in Michigan

[6/29/23, 6:32:04 AM] Gary Teh: In that theoretical model, governors (legislative branch) will only be responsible for updating the ledger to tokenize member contributions. 

And the updates should be based off of their interpretation of what they read on the rubric. They will only have editing rights to the ledger and have no editing rights to rubric.
[6/29/23, 6:44:12 AM] Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli: Hi,
My point was the following: 
With a Swiss association, there are necessarily (i) a committee (or board) and (ii) members. Then, pursuant to the articles of association, there may be additional "bodies" such as a "board of governors" or the like, with specific tasks/roles.
You may - by analogy and with some limits - see the GM (i.e. the members) as a _legislative body_ and the committee/board as an _executive body_, but it would be more questionable to see a _judicial branch/body_ in this picture (I would say that the analogy reaches its limits before you get there...).
[6/29/23, 6:44:51 AM] Fabien - Legal Swiss Aepli: I agree.
[6/29/23, 7:32:36 AM] Gary Teh: Good point. Doesn't seem like these two models resolve cleanly.

Any price beyond that and you have a hard time unloading your inventory into the market. This means you start losing cash for storage
[6/30/23, 6:54:49 AM] Kelvin Chew: And your cost price is?

[6/30/23, 11:28:40 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I payed $6.99 - $8.99 for human.   Usually Lindt and other luxury brands hit that $1 Oz max

[7/6/23, 1:36:47 PM] Gary Teh: This new form we have made available for DAO members to submit their preferred rate is going to be a very interesting dynamic to observe

https://truesight.me/dao/preferred-rate

My hunch is members who plan to utilize the outputs generated via the network would probably want this rate to be as low as possible so as to minimize the amount they end up paying for the final end product. 

While members who spent a lot of effort setting up the network would probably want the rate to be as high as possible so as to maximize the amount of value captured for transactions passing through this network. 

Or perhaps as @31641075825 suggested, most of the members will probably not care to vote until such a day when a huge volume of transactions start passing through this network on a daily basis and our DAO ends up accumulating a lot of liquidity.
[7/6/23, 1:40:32 PM] Gary Teh: @573136732781 and @554792626338 both of you will definitely want to submit your preferred rates, as the standard rate will directly impact how sweet a deal you end up getting for both proposals you are right now surfacing in our DAO.

My assumption is that at some point, the standard rate will also become applicable to the Hospitality idea that @31641075825 is right now championing.

I am aware that the Standard Rate is already immediately applicable for what @573136732781 has in mind since she is planning to directly procure the ceremonial grade inventory we have available right now for her cacao ceremony.

[7/8/23, 6:52:55 PM] Gary Teh: So final price to you will be 

USD4 * 1.19765008251163486%

Plus shipping cost to your address for the bar
[7/8/23, 6:53:28 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : This is hilarious
[7/8/23, 6:54:01 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : And shipping will be $7
[7/8/23, 6:54:24 PM] Gary Teh: Sound about right.
[7/8/23, 6:54:58 PM] Gary Teh: If it works, it works

If it doesn’t work then it doesn’t work
[7/8/23, 6:55:17 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It's of no exact benefit to me jajaja  but why not Say yes
[7/8/23, 6:55:37 PM] Gary Teh: It’s nice to be able to rapidly test this. 🤣
[7/8/23, 6:55:54 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : It's worth it in the cash to test
[7/8/23, 6:56:40 PM] Gary Teh: I remembered the first time someone used bitcoin to pay for anything way back then was 2 bitcoins for a pizza delivered to his place somewhere in Europe 

In hindsight, it was one very expensive pizza 🤣
[7/8/23, 6:58:05 PM] Gary Teh: That is very true. 

Let me know what the physical address is. 

I will get the estimate for the price to ship the bar to you 

Once you transferred USDt to our DAO’s vault for the final amount, I will have this bar of ceremonial grade cacao shipped to you

No freighting cost was included since they arrived in the country in my backpack

The actual cost of the cargo shipments that will arrive later in the year will include freighting cost

[7/9/23, 8:31:41 PM] Gary Teh: I am just trying to figure out how far can we really push this whole concept of automating everything with all the AI tools out there without too much human inputs. 

I imagine a day when the machines can automatically detect our needs, create all the services to cater to those needs  and then generate the smart contracts automatically on blockchain to make those services available. 

The vision is there, it probably needs more RnD before it can be actualized and we go permanently join the Do Nothing Society

The big three (Cargill amongst them) just suppress the purchase price offered to the farmers in Bahia and Ecuador.

[7/14/23, 5:10:18 PM] Gary Teh: One key difference between Agroverse and other cacao nibs maker out there is that we are technically more a community project (cooperative) than a profit oriented company (especially those competing on Amazon). 

And based on the preferred rates that I observed submitted so far, a way larger portion of our net profit is going to be directed back to these agricultural communities we sourced from than one would see in a normal profit oriented company… 81% 😮

Feel free to submit your preferred rates

[7/14/23, 5:32:50 PM] Gary Teh: The more we can help sustain the livelihoods of farmers utilizing such farming methods along the edges of the Amazon forest, the less likely they will give up on it and turn the forest into pasture, the longer we can forestall the actual deforestation of the Amazon that is happening on a large scale right now 

When I was speaking to the guide while I was in the Amazon what I learned was that a lot of the farmers are just basically giving up and clearing up their private patch of Amazon forest to cultivate soy for export to China instead 🤔
[7/14/23, 6:24:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : A story which runs to the begining of the problem and mess we áre in
[7/15/23, 11:29:43 AM] Gary Teh: One recurring theme during my discussion with @12023686334 on separate occasions is that at the commodity level a bag of cacao nibs is still functionally a bag of cacao nibs after taking into account the following

    - nutrient level
    - price
    - logistics

What really differentiates a bag of cacao nibs from from all the other bags of cacao nibs out there is the story behind it.

[7/18/23, 7:34:23 PM] Gary Teh: I was also consulting ChatGpt the other day if we were a cult. Its response was that we were not, since everything is open, transparent and rule based. 

Also for us to qualify as a Cult, there needs to be cult leader worshipping activities present. However if you haven't noticed yet, folks generally give me (the supposed cult leader) shit publicly and privately when things don't work. And often times, in our still infantile system of 2 years, they need more ironing.

So my role is more of the janitor (cleaning up shit). 

For folks who habitually come to me saying I should act as the leader and order people around, please do understand about the only thing I can really do is figure out what is a rule that could be surfaced for voting and adoption into our DAO's constitution.

Congratulations, you have raised your first VC round! Now what? In addition to having capital to build, you now have investors who are rooting for you and want to help you succeed. You also likely have reporting responsibilities along with commitments to good governance. Come hear from Em Westerhold, a16z's partner in charge of financial advisory for the crypto fund who will be sharing what you can expect and how to make the most from your new stakeholders. Also, if you are just getting ready for your first funding, Em will share her perspective on some housekeeping best practices so you are 'VC' ready.

[7/23/23, 9:30:41 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through all the functions that would exist in a traditional company, seems the one and only function that is absolutely critical to Agroverse’s success is as @12023686334 suggested… the Marketing function 

Coincidentally this podcast landed in my inbox around the same time I came to this conclusion, and I just finished listening to it 

https://open.spotify.com/episode/7hBM4RYc3nv9a6QArrKfZV

The gist of getting from USD0 to USD10 million in revenue within a year, 5 things:

    1 - figure out your UVP 

    2 - figure out how to explain your UVP in one sentence that will drive at least 1% conversion rate from initial contact to sales  

    3 - prioritize the marketing channels based on scalability 

    4 - package your UVP for delivery in the marketing channels that will elicit the WTF response as compared to other brands competing in the space

    5 - or find a channel that is not yet utilized by other competing brands

[7/24/23, 11:25:13 PM] Gary Teh: It just occurred to me that there are two prevailing mental models that members in our DAO are unconsciously using



*Mental model 1: we are a community/social network*

When activity level (sound bites) is low within our channel, members using this mental model will interprete it as a sign of low engagement level (aka ill health in our DAO). We need to do something to reengage the members to drive up activity level (aka sound bites)



*Mental model 2: we are a board of directors actualizing a shared vision*

When sound bite level in the channels get too high, members using this mental model will get annoyed because there is too much distraction. 

What they really care about are the following:

    - good news (where should we gather to pop the champagne)
    - bad news (shit happened, what to expect next)
    - progress (where are we now, what to expect next)
    - what needs to be done next and how can they help 



*my perspective*
Around 50% of last year was spent experimenting with mental model 1. Also running in parallel was this collective soul searching process where we iteratively figured out our DNA (core values, mission,  purpose and vision). 

Personally, the mental model 1 experiment was an extremely entertaining experience. 🤣

But based on the occasional private feedback from quite a few folks who were looking at it purely from mental model 2, the extreme level of sound bites were considered super distractive and somewhat annoying. 

Now that our purpose, mission and core values are clearly defined thanks to the collective effort these past period, the heightened levels of sound bites when gauged against this clearly defined set of standards did not really help advance us towards actualizing our vision.  

A better indicator of DAO health from the mental model 2 paradigm is the likelihood members will voluntarily step forward to help tackle a problem whenever one surfaces as we progress along our journey of actualizing our shared vision. Or in the scenario where skillset is honestly lagging, voluntarily recruit a new member that has it. 

Based on this indicator, even if the sound bites level in our channels is dead as a cemetery, so long as problems are getting solved and recruitment are taking place, our DAO is still considered extremely healthy.

[7/25/23, 11:25:05 PM] Gary Teh: Taking a step back and examining this setup, the dynamic closely replicates the prisoner’s dilemma
[7/25/23, 11:35:20 PM] Gary Teh: If no one buys any of the NFTs and the entire shipment is sold successfully then all the profits generated goes back to the DAO

If all the NFTs are sold off and the entire shipment is sold off, then (based on the Standard Rate) only 20% of the profit gets channeled back to the DAO. The NFT holders get 80% of the generated profit.
[7/26/23, 2:51:00 AM] Anupa/diya: We will have to look at Rte breakup of the nft and also what will be floor price in a bit more detail.
[7/26/23, 7:39:38 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective once our DAO buys back the NFTs after the entire shipment is clear, we burn it. 🙂
[7/26/23, 9:25:27 AM] Gary Teh: Do you have a formula that you would like to propose for consideration?
[7/26/23, 9:34:21 AM] Anupa/diya: I am doing a map which can be discussed openly. If we have people who are interested in the tokenomics, please reach out to us !
[7/26/23, 10:34:18 AM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to viewing the map 

I have personally set aside some funds which I will be happy to invest into the Shipment Financing NFTs of Agroverse if it’s structured in such a way it’s attractive for me as a fiat investor 

Not sure if you noticed… I have took off my operator/builder hat and looking at the deal purely from an investor perspective now that it’s starting to shape up for deal readiness. 🙂

[7/27/23, 9:52:18 PM] Gary Teh: Managed to bump into my friends Shirley and Wesi this morning during the event

Shirley is an angel investor in the Web3 space. Seems her hypothesis is aligned with ours regarding e-commerce being the first vertical that Web3 will really gain traction

Weisi use to work for Amazon and was for a while the Venture team for Aminoca brand (a really large Web3 fund focused on games)

Will offer Shirley access to mint the Agroverse shipment financing NFT when it becomes available

Will chat with WeiSi to get some insights on where the Aminoca brand is headed regarding investment themes to figure if there might be any alignment with our project when she invites over for the gathering of friends she mention she was going to organizing. (Jerry another DAO member is going to be there too) 🙂

There is a natural synergy there. The value of OffChain token and the TrueSight DAO token naturally reinforces and energizes each other’s value. 🤩

Already TrueSight DAO have benefitted tremendously from that ecosystem with some really high powered members recruited from it

Leaderboards drive motivation and competition in games. Once our voting passes, the governor profiles on TrueSight DAO's Crunchbase become our exclusive meta game leaderboard. It showcases your achievements, fostering recognition and motivation within our community and the wider Web3.0 tech ecosystem.

As TrueSight DAO grows stronger, your individual profile ranking on Crunchbase will also increase, gaining you more personal recognition in the Web3.0 tech ecosystem.

Keep up the great work! 🤩👍

[8/1/23, 8:56:32 PM] Anupa/diya: Thanks Dan. I am also conducting session on experiences of keto. If we can get a few people or places to join that would be great !
[8/1/23, 8:56:58 PM] Anupa/diya: Please spread the work . It's most probably end of August or beginning of September!
[8/1/23, 9:59:55 PM] Dan: Not sure sure about keto and nibs, but definitely have friends that enjoy drinking cacao. I’ll ask around
[8/1/23, 10:01:29 PM] Dan: Great, I’ll ask around🙂
[8/2/23, 5:35:53 AM] Gary Teh: Even though I saw the machines in the factory, I got curious how to the actual conversion of cacao nibs into chocolate actually works. 

Seems all you really need is just a blender

[8/2/23, 5:45:22 AM] Anupa/diya: There was this video I saw of this woman who can the natural cacao and she peeled. Roasted and ground the Nibs.. 

Which made me think of DIY Bespoke experience of field to cup which can be thought about latwe

[8/2/23, 6:53:11 PM] Gary Teh: This thread about sharing insights on cacao nibs for keto use on reddit is taking off like wildfire right now

https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/15ge8eq/anyone_one_had_any_experience_using_cacao_nibs_in/

I still haven’t found a smooth transition to direct any of them to sign up for ouronline focus group via meetup.com

Ends up the snowballing conversation with all the keto Redditers are organically throwing off a whole bunch of insights into their keto consumption behavior

I think this problem you are observing is mainly the result of my profile. I have this tendency to just allow someone whom I am speaking to to just go where he/she naturally wants to go instead of directing them to go where I want them to go. Or even when we are hanging out we just end up going where the companion wants to go.

And yes, I will eventually head the way I want to go, but only after bidding them farewell with a smile and seeing them disappear around the bend. 

Compound this dynamic over a series of interactions with multiple people, instead of having a group of people congregating, we end up with a series of very deep one of one conversations between myself and a whole bunch of other people. Deep as in I totally understand what is going on in each and everyone of their head. Not sure if it actually goes the other way though because I default to the role of listener unless specifically prompted with a problem to think about and discuss. 🤔

[8/2/23, 7:15:07 PM] Gary Teh: Another interesting aspects of the Agroverse network to study and observe once it’s set up is the prisoner dilemma (cycle of destruction mechanism) that’s backed right into its core. 

Since prices of every single component of a shipment of cacao to the USA will be written into the blockchain for all to see, suppliers might initially “abuse” the network by baking too much margin into their quotation. however as we continue to scale by onboarding and making transparent more suppliers and their prices, the assumption is that suppliers will all end up keeping each other in check when they do provide their quotations or risk being cut out of the network for providing very uncompetitive pricing

Bulk of the members in our DAO are high level, high impact, highly connected individuals.

While it’s ok to manually test the viability of a process utilizing DAO members time, beyond the testing phase and entering into the execution phase, unless an activity in the process is generating at least USD100/hour of value (as according to our rubric) for the utilization of any DAO members time, the task should be reconsidered in the following order: 

    1 - dropped if possible 
    2 - automated using AI.
    3 - delegated to a non-DAO member (non believer)

@918017107841 is also based in India. She is right now designing a similar set of NFTs for Agroverse’s upcoming shipment of cacao nibs from South America to North America 

Perhaps the both of you should speak. I believe since both of you are in the same time zone collaboration should hopefully be easier 🙂👍
[8/5/23, 2:17:30 AM] TUSHAR SHARMA: Hey Gary! Thanks for mentioning, that was a hell of a project. Glad that Anupa's project doesn't involve anything shipping from India.

https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chocolate-making-ingredient-cocoa-hits-highest-price-46-years-2023-06-28/

Price of cacao is expected to keep increasing over the next few years 

Based on what I observed when visiting Brazil and the Dominican Republic, we should expect supplies to continue rising for the foreseeable future 

And cacao does store very well for long periods of time if stored in the right conditions

I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

[8/10/23, 10:44:46 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding our SunMint project Allison mentioned she will start looking into implementing solid state servers with zero moving parts. The challenge for her would be to keep the cost under USD1000

Those servers should theoretically run forever when deployed on the farmers’ premises 

Since we are considering the use of Proof of Authority for TrueChain, they should not cause too much heat generation

[8/10/23, 11:35:59 PM] Gary Teh: After Jerry left for home, me and Allison stuck around for a short bit where we chat about our tendency to keep injecting entropy into the system whenever we observe it on the cusp of achieving some form of equilibrium. Basically a dissipative structure 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system
[8/10/23, 11:38:48 PM] Gary Teh: Jerry was joking about the human mechanical Turk where AI defines the strategy and humans perform the offline action 

Taking a step back and looking at where we are heading it does feel like our DAO is slowly headed in that general direction with the introduction of ChatGpt as the unofficial member which gets utilized a lot in the background

[8/12/23, 11:01:21 PM] Gary Teh: It is a recurring pattern I observe that whenever a person is attempting to profit from information arbitrage, he/she will exhibit very cagey behavioral patterns. 

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space. Based on what I have heard so far via the extended network, depending on where we attempt to bring this disruption to (especially in areas where cartels are in control), some of us might even encounter assassination attempts. Sounds exciting... 🤔

[8/12/23, 11:21:33 PM] Gary Teh: I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

[8/14/23, 1:52:11 PM] Dan: Look forward to connect with you there!
[8/14/23, 2:01:25 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the Agroverse brand just now, and realized all these hunter gathering activities I have been doing during the pandemic seems right up that alley if we consider it to be a sustainable superfood consumer brand

[8/14/23, 2:04:58 PM] Gary Teh: What if we did the same nonsense but around the world and every time we find some really good ingredients that could be production used as a consumer product we just launch it on the Agroverse website
[8/14/23, 9:13:47 PM] Gary Teh: @14152693276 has been doing some RnD using chocolate as well this evening. 

Will pop by tomorrow to sample what was made. It looked really delicious in the photo 🙂

I am starting to sense as what I observed with @13104674556 @13134136108 and then myself, @16468233438 and @5511982667030 separately. 

The experience is not just about the consumption but also extends to the DIY RnD phase

It’s beyond food at this point, it’s crossing into the arts and craft section under the hobby category. My hunch is the creator enters into a FLOW state during this iterative process of creation. It’s almost therapeutic. 

I observe the creator profile also feels as sense of pride when the finally reveals the creation to the audience. 

And the shared consumption of the creation beyond that point almost feels like a celebration, a ritualized  consumption of sorts. 

I am starting to understand what @13134136108 meant when she mentioned the cacao ceremony can manifest in any form. 🙂
[8/14/23, 9:19:14 PM] Tess walkowski: That fits another movie and book, like water for chocolate

[8/14/23, 9:23:25 PM] Tess walkowski: The groves that the Mayans had were for show like botanical gardens
[8/14/23, 9:24:07 PM] Tess walkowski: The reason the indigenous do pagamentos or payments to the earth or earth deity is to keep the balance

[8/14/23, 10:41:31 PM] Gary Teh: I was thinking further about the idea of videos and communal celebrations

Reminds me of this documentary I made last year when I was invited to attend my friend’s master class in Fremont here in the Bay Area

He regularly goes around the Pacific Northwest teaching people how to forage and prepare food using foraged ingredients 

I wonder how receptive folks would be attending a monthly meetup in their local neighborhood where one of their own guides them in the form of a workshop on how to turn cacao nibs into chocolate bars 

https://youtu.be/rmulfscDVNU
[8/14/23, 10:53:16 PM] Gary Teh: Further extending on this what if we went about visiting, sampling and performing FSVP on those small scale farmers yet exporting to the USA across the entire Amazon region and then started bringing in their cacao nibs online into our Agroverse direct distribution network 

It definitely sounds like a very “nomadic” thing to do 🤣
[8/14/23, 10:56:01 PM] Tess walkowski: We do camps and schools and workshops.
[8/14/23, 10:56:37 PM] Tess walkowski: Composting. Fermenting. Foraging.
[8/14/23, 10:59:49 PM] Tess walkowski: We had a long discussion last night about the black Panthers
[8/14/23, 11:00:26 PM] Tess walkowski: One think people don't think about is that they provided food.
[8/14/23, 11:01:24 PM] Tess walkowski: Living in a dense area now in the north it's not like Cali or Florida where the food is cheap and nice
[8/14/23, 11:02:47 PM] Tess walkowski: One of the critiques is that finished chocolate is not made in the countries where the beans are. I'm not making chocolate.
[8/14/23, 11:03:14 PM] Tess walkowski: I found out about seeds in the traditional blend, cieba seeds
[8/14/23, 11:03:35 PM] Tess walkowski: So maybe a forget knows what cieba seeds to eat and how to add them to cacao
[8/14/23, 11:04:16 PM] Tess walkowski: The original recipe should be frothy..... Mixed in with 🌽
[8/14/23, 11:04:26 PM] Tess walkowski: It's like poridge
[8/14/23, 11:04:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Mix some nibs with the acorn pancake
[8/14/23, 11:06:00 PM] Tess walkowski: Farmers farm. Traders move products. Cookers cook.

I am prompting for him to check if he could get the contacts of the agricultural cooperative that the broker is interfacing with

After understanding how the regulations work here We can’t take imports from foreign food suppliers until we have inspected their facilities and gave them a thumbs up

[8/15/23, 6:45:11 PM] Tess walkowski: Some countries have cacao "brokers" some don't
[8/15/23, 6:47:30 PM] Tess walkowski: On asking my friends their certification would cost about $3000 - $5000
[8/15/23, 6:49:08 PM] Tess walkowski: I dream of the idea of a fund which supports bio diversity and farming regenerative land
[8/15/23, 6:49:47 PM] Tess walkowski: My friend Miguel does it here in Michigan.   He has cows and trees the two go together and now he has a maple forest.
[8/15/23, 6:50:15 PM] Tess walkowski: He doesn't sell his products and never will.  Trade and gift only. Because of the law.
[8/15/23, 6:51:17 PM] Tess walkowski: Like a dao model in a way. Milk a cow get some cheese. Help cook maple get syrup.
[8/15/23, 8:16:54 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. uSd3000-5000 to get certified for USDA NOP organic
[8/15/23, 8:17:50 PM] Gary Teh: That is the model I have proposed for Hans martin to adopt in Switzerland
[8/15/23, 8:23:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I think that's their export licence with the government, it would work properly only if a few farmers got together
[8/15/23, 8:25:04 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[8/15/23, 8:26:00 PM] Gary Teh: Have them organize as a cooperative and then we can deal with them

Not cost effective for us to deal with one farmer at a time 

Or what might be even more interesting would be for us to form the cooperative in Ecuador and recruit them to it
[8/15/23, 8:27:05 PM] Tess walkowski: Or in some time when I raise money for cacao acres :)
[8/15/23, 8:27:24 PM] Tess walkowski: Maybe there are different laws to trade with ecudor.
[8/15/23, 8:27:44 PM] Tess walkowski: They are asking other friends if anyone has the licenses
[8/15/23, 8:28:40 PM] Tess walkowski: For example in Ghana no one is allowed to direct purchase beans..... They did an experiment with fair trade which pain more and made a lot of money
[8/15/23, 8:29:05 PM] Tess walkowski: But it didn't really change who farmers sold to despite fair trade paying more
[8/15/23, 8:30:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Each big chocolate company makes a unique flavor profile and has to make sure they can recreate it
[8/15/23, 8:32:45 PM] Gary Teh: So farmers made more money. Consumers spent the same. Manufacturers and retailers made less
[8/15/23, 9:22:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade costs more
[8/15/23, 9:22:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Farmers sold to whoever came first
[8/15/23, 9:25:15 PM] Tess walkowski: And that's Ghana. I pay way more for actual farm produce here.
[8/15/23, 9:27:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Fair trade chocolate is usually like fifty cents more.
[8/15/23, 9:29:08 PM] Tess walkowski: Most farming we eat it plantations the cacao etc.    All our grocery fruit our organic berries etc.
[8/15/23, 9:31:13 PM] Tess walkowski: Small farmers in USA succeed by becoming the producers.    That's where there is more money. But this requires consumers to change.  Which they do.    Even if everyone shops in the grocery store, they still consume treats or habits based on ethics or diet or morals etc etc.
[8/15/23, 9:32:25 PM] Tess walkowski: In the old days before whole foods there were co ops
[8/15/23, 9:32:46 PM] Tess walkowski: People had to join to purchase bulk super foods
[8/15/23, 9:47:50 PM] Gary Teh: So fair trade means farmers get paid more, manufacturers and retailers get paid the same and consumers end up paying more???
[8/15/23, 10:05:19 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 do you think that is fair?
[8/16/23, 6:47:54 AM] Tess walkowski: I would assume on a higher price point retailets make more
[8/16/23, 6:48:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes I think it's fair.
[8/16/23, 6:48:55 AM] Tess walkowski: What I don't think is fair is monopolies price gouging
[8/16/23, 6:50:39 AM] Tess walkowski: We are dealing with monoculture and multinational companies, though I think the food in Cali and Florida is more diverse.
[8/16/23, 6:52:46 AM] Tess walkowski: I think most artisanal coffee is fair trade.
[8/16/23, 6:53:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I pay significantly more for food from an actual farmer and gladly.    That's different than fair trade that's local.
[8/16/23, 6:55:05 AM] Tess walkowski: If there was fair trade oranges , oranges that didn't destroy Chile, I would be the evangelist of that company.

[8/18/23, 10:13:02 AM] Gary Teh: Me and @41796560010 finished our session. Did not managed to get any participants to attend for this online focus group. Seems like it might be because people are still having their holidays. We will reschedule for September. 

Meanwhile @41796560010 please have a chat with @19514467219 who works on the ArtTalk Magazine. 🙂
[8/18/23, 10:18:48 AM] Iwona Fluda: Thanks, Gary! Great catching up today. Nice to e-meet you @19514467219 🤩
[8/18/23, 10:25:47 AM] Val Lapidus: Hey Gary, for the meet up on Sunday, have you received confirmations from that email you sent out?
[8/18/23, 10:59:17 AM] Iwona Fluda: And here we need to remember that we had 8 people registered! Maybe the timing is wrong or maybe, we could ask them to pay 1 dollar, so they will show up.
[8/18/23, 11:51:30 AM] Gary Teh: No response. It was basically a reminder email
[8/19/23, 10:34:15 AM] Gary Teh: Definitely worth doing some AB testing. let me reach out to JianWen (another DAO member based in Tokyo, Japan) who has lots of experience running local meetups in Tokyo using Meetup.com

[8/21/23, 9:22:22 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 @5491125130580 

I am aware both of you have questions about blockchain and web3 related stuff 

I have been receiving your DMs

I observed a lot of the questions I have been getting lately are somewhat recurring

Maybe we should just set a time to organize a AMA on LinkedIn 

Where anyone can participate by either asking whatever Web3 related questions you might have or simply chime by suggesting solutions you might employed successfully under such circumstances 

I believe it’s more effective use of time 

Please feel free to schedule the session and I will pop by 

As @918017107841 personally experienced recently, it took me more than a week to respond to her questions she sent via DM. 

@5491125130580 I know you have a whole bunch of questions for me so I believe it will not just personally benefit you but everyone else as well to have these questions answered
[8/21/23, 10:12:50 PM] Anupa/diya: I am happy to open it to the group - this was how can be use time stamping of the cacao nibs on the blockchain to promote tracebility and transperancy. As our main motto is to promote the

[8/22/23, 10:01:00 PM] Gary Teh: Love the idea you brought to @16468233438 about donating part of the profit proceeds to carbon offsets 

What I actually found even more intriguing was when meshing up  your idea with the one that @554888644380 surfaced earlier in the year 

Why stop there?

Cabruca cacao farmers plant trees i the jungle anyways 

We do know that carbon credits are issued when trees are planted 

Instead of donating the proceeds for carbon offsets, why not donate the proceeds to help these farmers plant even more cacao trees and in the process get carbon credits issued 

We can sell off these carbon credits to companies that need these carbon credits for their day to day operations

Seems like he is hinting at the following types of hard currency

Cacao backed coins
Gold backed coins
Land backed coins 
Energy backed coins
Military backed coins

Anything that is tied directly to physical resources that have direct utilization purpose and not fiat which issuers could simply mint away their debts while devaluing the store of value that savers hope to utilize in the future

[8/27/23, 9:58:23 AM] Gary Teh: I was giving some further thoughts about this

*The conclusion about what Agroverse is*
Agroverse is not the low cost provider of cacao nibs for people who simply want to drink cacao and will further perpetuate the social hardship and environmental destruction purely for the purpose of profitability 

Agroverse is a simple no brainer daily experience that anyone can engage in if they see themselves as deeply spiritual person with profound love for our humanity and natural environment. 

Someone who because of this profound love wants to do their part to save our Amazon forest and reverse climate change. 

It just so happens that we are engaged in drinking carefully sourced cacao as part of our efforts
[8/27/23, 10:02:52 AM] Gary Teh: So from this perspective a consumer that is just purely looking at price and has no love for our fellow humanity and our natural environment is not our target customer
[8/27/23, 10:05:32 AM] Tess walkowski: Even on this website there is a major difference between those prices one is $4 one is $8
[8/27/23, 10:06:13 AM] Tess walkowski: This site is b2b and requires minimum purchase
[8/27/23, 10:46:33 AM] Gary Teh: What is the minimum purchase??
[8/27/23, 10:47:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Starts at $100
[8/27/23, 10:47:25 AM] Tess walkowski: They have criolla I would try
[8/27/23, 10:47:45 AM] Tess walkowski: Not much
[8/27/23, 10:48:37 AM] Tess walkowski: Personally I would choose to pay more when it's ethical.
[8/27/23, 10:48:50 AM] Tess walkowski: I would want to find the best not the cheapest
[8/27/23, 10:50:06 AM] Tess walkowski: We probably need to have it here in USA at under $10 a kilo cleared I think ?
[8/27/23, 10:50:59 AM] Tess walkowski: I pay a lot for my criolla.
[8/27/23, 10:51:39 AM] Tess walkowski: It's not "ceremonial" if I don't have the right stuff
[8/27/23, 10:55:20 AM] Tess walkowski: B2B ethical criolla ceremonially fair trade, sure it's fine to even pay the initial trade more up to $22 a kilo   shipping customs will add another $8-15

[8/28/23, 8:30:33 PM] Anupa/diya: Carbonbase is very proud to announce partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to Launch Asia's First Digital Carbon Registry.
Carbonbase, a climate-tech and carbon reduction solutions provider, is excited to announce a groundbreaking partnership with the HBAR Foundation and ImpactX to launch Global Climate Registry (GCR), Asia’s first digital native Carbon Registry.

"Our previous work in supporting climate solutions' adoption in APAC naturally drove us to find new ways to inspire and aid climate action" Max Song CEO of Carbonbase noted.

"We believe in a future where the balance sheet of our planet lives on a public ledger. It is critical that standards and methodologies are governed and operated in a publicly auditable manner that is easy for project developers to adopt." said Wes Geisenberger, Vice President of Sustainability & ESG at The HBAR Foundation.

"GCR represents a pivotal milestone in the intersection of climate change, digital green finance and blockchain technology" said Katherine Foster, Executive Director Green Digital Finance Alliance & Former Canadian Climate Diplomat.

Blockchain can significantly improve the current bottlenecks of current carbon registries and increase transparency, accountability and traceability of greenhouse gas emissions. It helps companies provide more accurate, reliable, standardised, and readily available data on carbon emissions.

This decentralized approach allows for tracking and reporting of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions along the entire supply chain, including manufactures, suppliers, distributors and consumers.

[8/28/23, 10:22:32 PM] Gary Teh: Had the great opportunity to listen to Mike Jordan share his theory on statistical contract theory during the talk this Sunday in Berkeley University. 

https://www.amazon.science/blog/icassp-michael-i-jordans-alternative-view-on-ai

The framework reminds me of how the number of tokens for each category of contribution is set in our rubric. 

How his theory applies to us is that overtime as we collect more data for each category of contribution on our ledger we will be able to determine via statistics what the right amount of governance token should be. 

Have a read of his paper if you are keen.
[8/28/23, 10:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: If we ever get to the point one day of training an AI to automatically grade an incoming contribution based on our rubric and then automatically adjust the value of governance tokens associated with a line item of our rubric then we would have basically implemented the theoretical framework he posits in practice

[8/31/23, 8:17:23 PM] Gary Teh: Everyday in the morning after you have finished brushing your teeth, the app will propose three verbs that you are already going to do anyway sometime during the day 

You will choose one out of the three proposed 

During the course of the day when you perform the verb, you will be required to be fully present when performing it for just 3 seconds  

Nothing else beyond that 

The choice of verb proposed for you will be surfaced based on your astrological natal chart that will most heighten your energy frequency for the day. It’s based on 五行 the five elements and the astrological research from the banaras spiritual institute of India

Some of the historical *key reasons for common pool resources management failure*:

1. to define clearly what are the resources being managed

2. Clear accounting of how much resource is there

3. Not making the pain of management failure clear and in your face vivid.

He mentioned the same thing as @14806488258 

Creating our own insurance facility at some point that folks along the supply chain can purchase to insure shipment passing through our network

Coincidentally insurance is the business for parent company to social impact fund that  @14152693276 is at. 

@41799155602 also mentioned the floating of a futures sustainable commodity market. This seems to in line with the thinking of the cooperative folks in Bahia

[9/7/23, 6:44:12 AM] Gary Teh: I finally bumped into a local that spoke English last night at one of the cafes. 

She explained the same hobo whom I bumped into again the second evening and showed me his knife… again… was in fact trying to rob me… both times in fact. 

He walked off the second time cursing and swearing. In hindsight it must have been a really frustrating experience for him for attempt at robbing someone and fail miserably because of communication breakdown 🤔

I would have imagined if I was a robber, I would have just took the knife and stabbed my target instead of showing it to him both two times as though I was trying to sell him the knife 🤷‍♂️

[9/10/23, 7:19:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: too many hashtags , algo can easy take it for spam.  from experience, 5 to 15 most relevant is optimum level

[9/10/23, 8:32:00 AM] Iris - Community Manager: Agreeing with @31641075825 on this, if the content needs to be prepared, let's use ChatGPT for the outline and then we can work on details.
[9/10/23, 8:33:10 AM] Iris - Community Manager: I was on a call with a Google employee the other day, it seems Google is preparing an update related to usage of AI content, but it might not be negative

[9/12/23, 1:40:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: no content is bad for social media, i can already see this type of videos fitiing perfectly the expression "work hard,play hard" :D
[9/12/23, 2:06:51 PM] Val Lapidus: I disagree. You muddy your message by having this type of content.  Maybe in the future once the proof of concept is established.  But right now just makes it seem amateur
[9/12/23, 2:08:00 PM] Val Lapidus: If I am learning about a brand and the fourth video is work hard. Play hard.  I'm sorry but we haven't worked hard enough to have the fourth video be the party hard video.  There's a time and a place.  Save this for later.  Should not be the fourth episode.

[9/12/23, 9:40:18 PM] Anupa/diya: It will be a byproduct to the larger purpose. The alignment and purpose of a DAO will be important for the sustainability
[9/13/23, 4:36:51 AM] Suheil - Europe: it's not about blockchain, it is about building a proper "automated" ecosystem. by theory we know that as a tool blockchain is the most efficient to adopt efficient scalability. 

until now, everything has been worked on by small teams on heavily dependent on a couple of individuals ( just like in a traditional company). Which is completely normal for bootstrap and MVP If we are progressively targeting real decentralization .... other wise it would be just another project ran by some specific teams with a very obvious kill switch threat 🤷‍♂️ 

conclusion: blockchain is a TOOL that CAN help us build progressively into a DAO.
[9/13/23, 5:22:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: while we are talking about this i read : "“We have global clients looking to use these products and in some sense, almost not caring that it’s blockchain, right? They just want access to this new feature.”" from big boss at JP Morgan

[9/16/23, 8:21:42 AM] Gary Teh: two potential ESG community initiatives has organically has surfaced during this trip

*initiatives discovered*
     - vacuum sealer for cooperative here to be used on the cacao nibs to be shipped: USD2000

    - somewhat falling apart facility that youths here hangout at that city hall set aside: budget TO be determined

*followups*
    - surface voting to DAO to extend page on Agroverse.shop focused on ESG initiatives we seek to fund with profits
[9/16/23, 8:49:30 AM] Gary Teh: There has been some discussions surfaced organically by them about setting a local NGO here that utilize our governance model but on blockchain to ensure funds are channeled where they should. 

It’s been proposed that someone from our DAO be invited to join as director to ensure the integrity of the governance model
[9/16/23, 8:53:05 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/16/23, 8:53:38 AM] Gary Teh: Will make an Bean to Bliss episode covering the youth center 🤩
[9/16/23, 9:11:20 AM] Anupa/diya: That would be necessary if the DAO governance feeds in to the community.

 It would also be necessary that the DAO appoints the flag bearers from the farming community who will liason this community
[9/16/23, 10:10:19 AM] Gary Teh: True. Someone else should volunteer for this

I have too much on my plate… I just want to do… nothing!! 🤩

What I heard from Orlantildes is that a lot of the land were simply abandoned by the farmers when the witch bloom fungus invaded their cacao plantation

[9/22/23, 2:29:29 AM] Gary Teh: Understood from the cooperative they right now are exploring issuing cacao coins to their farmers in exchange for taking their cacao inventory 

Once Agroverse prove we can sell off their inventory in the USA market, I think we might be able to propose to the cooperative to a deeper partnership. to send us their inventory on consignment (we don’t pay for it)

The way I envision it working is that in this scenario:

    - the farmers themselves become the financiers of the inventory 

    - our DAO finances the freighting cost to USA which we will then deduct from the *gross profit* 

    - our DAO finances the packaging cost which we will then recoup from the *gross profit* 

    - from the *net profit* , DAO charge the standard rate (19%) to back the value of our governance tokens 

     - of the *net profit* the rest (81%) all goes back to the farmers for financing the inventory. They get a really good price 
    
    - we retool Edgar (our AI) to monitor USA online markets to identify *consumer market arbitrage opportunities* for the farmers products 

    - farmers and DAO can utilize Edgar’s report to decide which USA consumer market opportunity to bet on. This will be possible because we have full visibility of all the cost components along the entire supply chain 

    - farmer bears cost for inventory. DAO bears cost for freighting. Both have enough skin in the game to want the outcome to be positive 

    - the cooperative self regulates the cost price of the inventory. If they price it too high, the USA consumer will not buy. DAO will not want to take shipment 

    - cooperative members contributing to help build out the network can vote on standard rate too. 

All interest are aligned, we end up with a self balancing system. No need to haggle over price between supplier and distributor 🤩

[9/23/23, 6:44:22 PM] Gary Teh: Beginning to get a sense of what business development after being first introduced to this subject two years ago by @6598383264 and then observing @41799155602 in action up close on how it’s conducted 

If our projects are software, it’s Basically an iterative hacking process which involves modifying its API interface to integrate with external third party service provider or fitting into external third service consumer while keeping a residue of the resource that flows through the pipeline 🤩
[9/23/23, 6:56:17 PM] Gary Teh: The primary difference between software development and business development I observe is that 

During the hacking process, when software receives “junk” inputs, they will either throw well formed exception messages or simply crash 

With business development, since we are technically “hacking” humans, subjects either get really annoyed, frustrated or just simply stop responding when fed with “junk” inputs 

“White box” based testing methods to figure out what works and what not tends to be more challenging to deploy as a hacking approach in business development 🤔

[9/26/23, 4:46:00 AM] Dr. Denis: Folks, are you aware that voluntary carbon credits is multi-bilion $ worth scam by design as confirmed by recent scientific & investigative journalism articles (90% of promissed CO2 emission reductions are fake) 🤔
‎[9/26/23, 4:48:55 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/26/23, 4:53:35 AM] Dr. Denis: Plants need CO2 and warm weather to grow. Current average global temperature is 13.9 degrees C while minimum ambient temp required for human survival is 18 degrees. Man-made global warming is scam! We are lucky to live during the current warming period explained by maltitude of natural factors

[9/26/23, 5:29:28 AM] Dr. Denis: Build a coal power plant to supply affordable and reliable electricity and heat to people that would be also highly beneficial to nature ecosystem
[9/26/23, 5:31:20 AM] Gary Teh: Do you have any studies at all on the yearly carbon emissions of a regular coal power plant? 

And what are some latest RnD that will allow for a coal power plant to emits zero carbon?
[9/26/23, 5:32:49 AM] Gary Teh: Actually a study on how much carbon is consumed by plants for photosynthesis per year and how much carbon is already being generated by all living organisms will be really helpful

What we want to net balance

[9/26/23, 6:02:25 AM] Dr. Denis: I am pretty serious about climate change, fake "green energy" and "CO2 damaging the environment" fraud propagated by mass-media, UN bodies and politicians. It has nothing to do with real science. I've been doing my own research in this area for 20+ years (up to PhD level) and I am happy that the laureate of Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 Dr. John Clauser confirmed that I was right https://youtu.be/TGrMvlxEQGk
[9/26/23, 6:07:46 AM] Dr. Denis: There is a tight "Energy-Water-Food" nexus. It's not possible to solve one problem while ignoring & exacerbating other problems. Dutch farmers pump CO2 into greenhouses to increase their yields. CO2 is the food for plants and the source of life on Planet Earth. Capturing CO2 from coal power plants and/or buying fake voluntary carbon offset is non-sense. As a supporter of Agroverse DAO I am sharing here my thoughts and I am eager to contribute my academic & practical knowledge
[9/26/23, 6:14:11 AM] Gary Teh: So can we do the reverse?

When farmers pump CO2 into their farm we issue carbon credits??
[9/26/23, 6:28:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes i know one of the scammers (llike noot personally but of his existence) and he lives well protected iin one of the most expensive penthouuses in tel aviv 🙂

[9/26/23, 6:55:27 AM] Dr. Denis: My suggestion is to simply drop this carbon credits idea because it's anti-human ecocidal scam which is being gradually exposed in various publications

@14152032783 and @8618926086648 has helped setup the San Francisco off chain telegram channel where lots of web3.0 events are advertised

I wonder if it would be helpful to reach out to all of them to offer complementary cacao nibs tasting as and when we need feedback for our cacao nibs 

The channel is here

[9/30/23, 6:59:39 PM] Jonathan: This sounds like a nice value add or maybe at an event with a little time for you to talk about the DAO behind it. The key would be able to make it easy to order if people enjoyed them. Really easy to order.
[9/30/23, 7:14:43 PM] Gary Teh: Venmo where we can accept payment right now for the inventory we have on display

If we run out then QR code where they could just order on our website  

Natural complement to the events organized by OffChain since I observe most of the events cater food as well 

We can be one of the mini-caterers
[9/30/23, 7:16:36 PM] Jonathan: Sounds like it has some legs.. especially if you can get the story out which will probably give web3 people a bit more incentive to buy
[9/30/23, 11:17:55 PM] Gary Teh: I think the important thing is recurring buying behavior like a subscription model

What might be interesting would be to serve one cacao derivative (brownie, ceremonial cacao drink…) during a meetup and then have the recipe (perhaps even the profile of the creator) handy and the cacao nibs ready for sale if participants want to DIY when they get home

Each month we will feature the most popular community submitted recipe during the meetup

Perhaps if web3 project wants to get their project feature, their team should compete by submitting their own recipes as well.


*Two potential methods for distributing our governance tokens too*

    - creator of winning recipe for the month 

    - off chain member who held the meetup and got critical mass of participants

*purpose*
    - serves to incentivize web3 project participation in friendly competition of who makes the best cacao recipe for the month 

    - serves to incentivize off chain member who holds the meetup to do a good job of drawing crowd 

    - to them the token will have value as it’s value is backed by the profit generated from the sale of cacao nibs they are tasting ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/23, 9:47:00 AM] Gary Teh: Before I left Bahia, the cooperatives gave me some samples of highly differentiated cacao derivatives that were never before seen in the USA market 

They will probably need some investment before they could be brought online and made available in the USA market 

Since the samples are small, I am thinking of conducting a sample tasting and RnD prioritization session in SF when I get back. 

To ensure optimal experience, there shall only be 8 slots in this session. And they will be reserved only for DAO members who are qualified as general assembly members 🙂🙏

Items 1 and 2 we can repackage for immediate sale on our website Agroverse.shop

Items 1-3 we will run a focus group to get some feedback with the help of @14152032783and @8618926086648 from OffChain as well as the Folks from Edge and Node

Items listed for *internal sampling*, we will invite DAO members (who are qualified as general assembly members) based in SF to come and help provide feedback and prioritize for productization 

As suggested by @5511982667030 I am chatting with @41765737357 to figure how *items 6 and 7* might be packaged as corporate gifts or gifts for special social occasions if DAO finally decides to go down the route proposed by @5511982667030

This video by Steve Jobs reminds me of how our guild model operates. 

Since there is a maximum capacity of 8 players per guild, the player least able to self actualize gets invited out to free up the opportunity for another player who can more readily self actualize within the scope of the guild 

Getting the opportunity to contribute in a TrueSight DAO guild is equivalent to the opportunity to self actualization in a collaborative space of like minded individuals ‎<This message was edited>

[10/3/23, 2:00:22 PM] Gary Teh: Spent the past 3 hours working on some semblance of a roadmap for TrueSight DAO. Items on the roadmap are subjected to changed depending on how the general environment unfolds. 

*The following Items are addressed*:
    - Future expansion of Agroverse in the USA market beyond successful sales of 100KG cacao nibs
    - When we will finally do initial round of "fundraising" for TrueSight DA
    - Future expansion of Agroverse beyond the USA market
    - When the SunMint project will finally come online
    - How TrueSight DAO might transition into a network state

[10/4/23, 11:13:45 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to do that in @⁨[ops] The Town Hall⁩ 

In the roadmap I did indicate that at some point we might start listing our governance tokens on decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges 

But those are when our operations and cash flows have fully scaled up to make the listing cost negligible (like a drop in the ocean) compared to the volume of profit we are generating. 

I think at that point which our DAO starts generating massive volume of cash flow, governance token holders should really think long and hard if they want the tokens listed and start introducing speculative elements within our DAO (like Tesla on the stock market) or just keep the governance tokens privately held only amongst contributors (like Craigslist)

Elon Musk did ever mentioned he regret bringing Tesla public because of all the public attention and all the speculative psychology introduced that distracts all Tesla employees once during an interview 

https://www.thestreet.com/technology/elon-musk-has-deep-regrets

I haven’t heard any of those 20 employees working at Craigslist complaining at all. They are literally pulling millions of dollars every year just between the 20 of them. I am sure they probably have a great time throwing their own version of the Carnival of Truth every quarter in some nice locations around the world and have no investors to report to 🤣

[10/4/23, 7:04:21 PM] Gary Teh: when you examine TrueSight DAO and it’s projects critically, it is basically fundraising everyday. Though alot of times fiat did not change hands 

Me investing my time and energy in it. @16468233438 doing the same. @918017107841 doing the same. @41799155602 doing the same. Shadi helping build the main site. @5511982667030 taking precious time away from her busy schedule to help when she could be selling it for a lot more via her consulting….

Folks who helped reposting all the Linkedin posts… 

All these micro-actions contributed by DAO members in exchange for governance tokens is fund raising. It’s just that no Fiat change hands. So unless you truly understand what investment is you wouldn’t recognize it when it’s happening right under your nose

So unless there is an expense item that needs a huge amount of fiat, I really don’t see any reason why we would need to go out of our way to convince some fund managers to write a big cheque. If we ever get to the point where we are forced to do that this means there is something wrong in the way we are operating or probably tackling a problem set that is not well suited for a decentralized model. 🤔

@16468233438’s sister in law who helps tech companies fundraise was examining our operating model last year. Her first feedback was in a DAO no one is truly accountable. And VCs hate that. There is zero sense of control and there is no way to fire the “CEO” and replace him/her with a better one when performance is not good. That is because there is none. 

That was the same exact feedback when I was chatting about this model with Jerry whose wife runs a VC fund. Zero accountability. People just come in and do whatever they feel like or take a break as and when they want to. 

@14806488258 summed it up the best. There are categories of problem that will generate 100X returns and require hyper growth and a strong central command and control. Those set of problems are best tackled by the existing startups and VC model

There are a separate set of problems that do yield returns but not the 100X kind which are still socially/environmentally important to tackle and solve. Those are where DAOs play a critical role. 

The community comes together to crowd fund the solving of a problem. The output is an economically self sustaining infrastructure that benefits both the society and the environment. You would probably get some healthy return multiples from you micro-investments if things pan out but don’t expect to retire on it ‎<This message was edited>
[10/4/23, 10:27:59 PM] Gary Teh: Also speaking of fundraising to finance big ticket items, I been having this side discussion with Satheesh this past day.

Seems his feelings got hurt by me repeating the same exact warning about the macro environment here which I gave him when I realized he was attempting to fundraise last month.

Right now is the worst of the worst macro environment to hope for someone to write a big fat cheque to fund your ideas. 

*signals I am getting*

1. Federal reserve Interest rates are still hiking like crazy

2. VCs are dramatically writing down the valuations of their portfolio companies

3. More rounds of layoffs are still happening in startups 

4. LPs are skittish about funding VCs. Even VCs themselves are laying off their entry to mid level associates

Jason Calanis already issued an early warning to all startups late last year that they should have at least raised enough to last for two years because the quarter starting October 2023 is going to be the worst of the worst

 If they haven’t secured their funding by then, they should at least make sure they internally have enough to last till mid 2024 with no further external fund injection. There are so many of these startups declaring bankruptcy right now and just simply shutting down 

Everytime I go visit some  of my friends startups here these past few months, I hear through the grapevine another round of lay offs  

I was joking with @16468233438 just now when we were hanging out over at his place, I have technically structured my entire lifestyle to be as independent of fiat as possible. With the current configuration, there is no expenses spent on accommodation. Bulk of it is just spent on food and transport. 

@16468233438 was suggesting to further refine this configuration by sourcing for food when in urban settings from the food banks which run daily. Then the only thing that still relies on fiat is basically transport and software subscription cost I am incurring on behalf of the DAO. 🤔

I am actually tempted to experiment with that food bank idea of his 

Right now, after manually survey all six continents over the past five years, I am doing the exact reverse. The experiment I am conducting right now is optimizing my physical movement to have all my needs fully met without needing to step out of the 4 square blocks here in SF. 🤩

Next month, I will up the ante of this experiment by spent three weeks at the zen monastery on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge 🤣

There is no better way to reset the hedonic thread mill by hitting a hard reset button going in the opposite direction. 🤩

This deliberate self restriction of physical movement seems also aligned with what @6590995199 suggested for this period when he looked at my date and time of birth using his own fortune telling system 🤔

Side note, fiat is a proxy of the actual resource required to get stuff done. If you could by pass fiat to get the stuff done, then there is no need fiat. So if such is the case, why waste precious time and resources chasing after fiat? 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/4/23, 10:39:34 PM] Suheil - Europe: truesight dao can’t and does not need traditional fundraising methods. specifically not vc’s. . by fundraising we take cheap money and spend expensive expertise. the dao’s strength is innovating the way traditional businesses seek resources from expertise /human power to funds/budgets for scalability… the moment agroverse rolls and starts generating revenue, the dao can seek funds via “community investing/funding /grants“. 
investments /funding will be on micro and specific related subjects. 
In the moment we have operations hence we create value to truesight token and when ready/mature enough we can launch it on defi’s to generate liquidty...
[10/4/23, 10:42:19 PM] Suheil - Europe: or you can do like all the majority building new web3 businesses defying the total principles of it so you can fundraise easy via truesight inc and re centralize the decentralize system hhh ‎<This message was edited>

[10/4/23, 11:20:51 PM] Gary Teh: Lol! Then it’s not decentralized 

It’s just marketing 🤣

[10/4/23, 11:29:25 PM] Suheil - Europe: they give grants token basaed only to builld on theiir chain . for the time being we are not building tech from our end .whenever we do , we aalready have access to those we just need to know how to capitalize on them
[10/4/23, 11:31:50 PM] Suheil - Europe: So to all my fellow European-based (or non just harder to travel), I want to take the initiative to try organize first Truesight DAO  IRL meet-up. 
I will launch a poll for the pilot October meet-up in the cities where I am personally well capable of organizing easy logistics, other propositions are always open.

Why IRL meet up? Getting to know each other on personal level helps us collaborating further into pushing truesight’s goals :) ‎<This message was edited>

[10/4/23, 11:45:52 PM] Anupa/diya: That's a given . For sure. If we need to digitize the ledger and if we need to scale. We will end it

[10/5/23, 12:10:53 AM] Gary Teh: In terms of digitizing the ledger, I still haven't seen anyone bother to step and be the book keeper or bother to update the ledger for their own contributions. 

If no one is already voluntarily doing that on Google sheet I wonder who will actually bother to do it on blockchain if and when we migrate over... 

All the psychological studies states more effort equals lower conversion rate... I figure until something drastically changes, it will primarily be just wishful thinking🤔🤣
[10/5/23, 12:49:45 AM] Anupa/diya: I personally feel it's an effort  to a. Locate the link. B. Figure out the calculation and then go to another site to see how it reflects

[10/9/23, 9:16:35 AM] Nikita Nikita: Huh! I missed this message 
I’m gonna be commuting btw LA and SF for the next 2 months 
NFTify has been admitted to Celo’s incubator

He’s leading it
[10/9/23, 9:17:39 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 what is the machine you use to grind cacao nuts into chocolate?

We will need one of those to grind our cacao nibs into chocolate for the cacao ceremonies we will be serving out during web3 events where participants can *drink cacao, open your heart, network better* ‎<This message was edited>
[10/9/23, 9:18:27 AM] Gary Teh: Congratulations! 

Could you propose ways where this can help *boost the value of our TDG governance tokens*? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/9/23, 9:19:54 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 I remember you applying for grants from Celo foundation for our DAO. 

Could you follow up with @17472295463 directly to figure out how you can get her help to get the grant approval accelerated 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/9/23, 9:21:26 AM] Suheil - Europe: ah i got the response ii think i iforgot to update here, their response was to re apply when we advance further with the project .
My personal opinion is they want to see how we create value to our tokenomics
[10/9/23, 9:22:00 AM] Gary Teh: Have you showed them our Agroverse.shop??
[10/9/23, 9:23:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: everything.
both whitepapers. 
agroverse pages (back then was the old version of the website)
[10/9/23, 9:23:10 AM] Gary Teh: Or this listing on Amazon 

https://www.amazon.com/Product-title-Agroverse-Organic-Brazil/dp/B00NNYBMJ8
[10/9/23, 9:24:15 AM] Suheil - Europe: this listing just got on , no ? i got theiir reply a while ago already . we can always re apply not an issue i wantted to wait unttil we generatte firrst sales or traffic . one mooment i check eexact date of their feedback
[10/9/23, 9:25:12 AM] Gary Teh: Got on Amazon mid last week 

Still need to follow up with them on the incorrect category problem
[10/9/23, 9:25:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: i got theiir response 3 weeks ago
[10/9/23, 9:29:28 AM] Suheil - Europe: also dont confuse nikita is joining their incubator program , iits completely different to the “fundraise applicatiion”: i submitted. 

thinking about it, joining an accelerator/ incubator makes much more sense for our project that asking for fundraise/ grant
[10/9/23, 9:31:12 AM] Anupa/diya: I have seen quite a few. J p Morgan had a great one. If there are a few people interested.  We can join
[10/9/23, 9:31:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: can murray on board agroverse to the incubator ?😀

[10/10/23, 7:11:28 PM] Gary Teh: *general thoughts on marketing*

A person’s lifespan is very very short in the grander scheme of things 

The *most pathetic thing* a marketer could do is waste a viewer’s precious little attention and convey nothing!

After analyzing past messaging by marketing greats like Steve Jobs, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, this is the common theme:

You are forced to either *strongly agree* or  *strongly disagree*. Whichever the case, their message leaves zero room to simply ignore them

[10/10/23, 7:33:17 PM] Val Lapidus: I liken Trump and Elons approach to marketing as snake oil salesmen.  Their products are shit
[10/10/23, 7:33:52 PM] Val Lapidus: Our product is not shit.  So we shouldn't try to trick our consumer into buying them
[10/10/23, 7:34:03 PM] Gary Teh: Which further emphasis how strong they are at getting their message out even though their product is shit 🤣

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rS8fFbW57o
[10/10/23, 7:36:51 PM] Val Lapidus: Is that on brand for agroverse?
[10/10/23, 7:37:18 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't think it is, and I don't think it aligns to our core values
[10/10/23, 7:37:31 PM] Val Lapidus: Integrity
[10/10/23, 7:37:41 PM] Gary Teh: I am sure marketing folks who cares will figure something otherwise it doesn’t really matter anyways… the project and the DAo will just run out of cash and go out with a pathetic whimper
[10/10/23, 7:37:50 PM] Val Lapidus: Integrity is counter intuitive to controversy
[10/10/23, 7:38:28 PM] Gary Teh: Actually not true 

I can already imagine a few cases when integrity and controversy goes hand in hand

[10/10/23, 7:41:21 PM] Val Lapidus: That's not all that controversial, since his company is named Virgin airlines
[10/10/23, 7:42:26 PM] Val Lapidus: I think our marketing team needs to focus for our cacao nibs on the fact that we are a unique taste that you cannot find in other products on the market
[10/10/23, 7:43:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Maybe offer a promotion if you find a product with same taste as ours we will refund you
[10/10/23, 7:45:31 PM] Gary Teh: Actually might be interesting would be to drag all our token holders into debt if this campaign you propose goes south since we have everybody’s contact details on file. 🤣

I can already imagine a 101 ways I could hack this proposition you just mentioned 🤔🤩
[10/10/23, 7:47:00 PM] Val Lapidus: Taste is subjective.  You will have a hard time proving that it tastes similar
[10/10/23, 7:47:18 PM] Gary Teh: That is the thing. It cuts both ways 🤣

Especially the one from the Dominican Republic that you yourself taste and immediately threw up.  

Lots of the low grade chocolate out there basically taste really nasty if their flavors were not masked by sugar. 

And some of the premium brands are literally serving these kind of Frankenstein chocolate 🧟‍♀️ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/11/23, 11:21:01 AM] Gary Teh: The country of Israeli is on the cusp committing war crimes against the Palestinian civilians living in the Gaza region. 

Bulk of western mass media is simply broadcasting messaging crafted by the politicians in the country of Israel. 

Bulk of the folks I observe in LinkedIn and Facebook have been brainwashed into about supporting isreali war efforts in Gaza 

https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-gaza-is-open-air-prison-israel-violating-international-law-2023-10

@31641075825 is there anyway to channel humanitarian support to provide some basic necessities to Palestinian civilians stuck in Gaza?

Please help by resharing. If you don't feel comfortable being associated please reach out to me to untag yourself. 

And if you really feel very strongly against our humanitarian efforts, please also feel free to leave the DAO. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

I know of folks in our DAO who don’t feel comfortable being dragged into controversial situations 

This is just a nicely presented exit for them to step out of the room if they don’t feel comfortable about what we are doing but feeling too shy due to the peer pressure 🙂

This is a DAO after all and *rage quit* is a feature. People should be encouraged to exercise their autonomy to utilize this feature whenever they feel like it ‎<This message was edited>
[10/11/23, 3:59:27 PM] Gary Teh: Just occurred to me, we already have something that people naturally want 

There is no reason to be paying advertisers fiat to get the word out for our cacao nibs like other tech companies 

Our product itself is the advertisement. 

We just need to come up with a whole bunch of different recipes to fit it for consumption at all the networking events out there. 

Like Cacao liquor 🤩

@14158669401 mentioned the other evening when we were chatting that if we did manage to pull off figuring out how to get such a decentralized operating model to work running a brick and mortar business we should really submit it as a candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize, because it’s going to be the very first of its kind in terms of fundamentally new economic model 🤩

I have some ideas which I will put into a framework which we can use to focus on our DAO member attention on market Agroverse. 

Currently DAO member attention is all over the place and not focused and directed. This is not very helpful when it comes to marketing Agroverse 

Will share the framework  tomorrow 

Thanks for reminding me of this experiment again yesterday @16468233438. Boomz! 👊

 along with events/ campaigns and other related  actions running parallel.
[10/11/23, 9:53:38 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective socialism means people get to free ride without getting their ass kicked

     - more angles where we can tell a controversial story that is relevant to Agroverse
    - more marketing channels which are yet untapped or saturated

[10/14/23, 12:34:28 AM] Gary Teh: What’s up! Nice to have met you again at the HackerDojo meetup 

You got really lucky with your timing dude all the other folks from the meetup that want to join our DAO now have to pay a toll (one way or another) to get into our channels 🤣

    - either await interview to be onboarded into one of our existing roles 

    - or pay USD100 before being allowed in

My sense is from this point forth, it is going to get more and more demanding to qualify for entry into our DAO

As @31641075825 mentioned, the engine has started and the boat has left the port. All the folks who haven’t boarded the boat while it was still docked will need to start working harder to get onboard 🚀💎 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/14/23, 6:08:15 AM] Vibhu Mittal: This article has interesting implications on the use of technology for provenance in food supply. There’s a new law that takes effect in January 2026 that will require more tracking and record keeping.

Food for thought.

And whenever they are executed by any DAO members, governance tokens are automatically awarded 🙂🙏

@31641075825 is already executing on V1 of our *daily social media post protocol* 

@918017107841 is in the process of defining *customer returns protocol* that web3 interns can execute upon to earn governance tokens

[10/19/23, 9:38:13 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 mentioned that a T-shirt will cost USD30 to print 

The cheapest way to test how viable this guerilla style marketing tactic would work would be for me to just go manually test this in the street of SF.

If we are able to generate 14+6 bags of cacao nibs of sale just by me doing my *Hobo thing* along *haight street* over the course of two weeks, this means this approach is both sustainable and scalable 

The sale covered the cost of the shirt as well as the cost of providing the *leather tramp* 1 meal a day 🤩

Sale of *6 bags* to cover cost of short 
Sale of *1 bag* a day to cover cost to feed the leather tramp ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/23, 11:40:38 PM] Gary Teh: I was having a chat over the phone just now with both my parents back in Singapore. 

I shared about the 0% sales conversion rate last Friday. 🤦‍♂️🤣

Strangely my dad immediately focused on a totally different metric. *did people like what they tasted at the sampling event?* 

My response: Yes they did. “Perfect score then” was his response  

Though I still remain skeptic. until I see actual sales taking place, I will default assume the *Yes* I am hearing is basically a polite *No* in disguise. I have been suckered too many times with this phenomena I just described 

Me and @16468233438 for purpose for our experiment will attempt to offload our entire inventory at the forthcoming night market happening on the 1st of November. 

Dad seems as bullish as @16468233438 about that forthcoming. I remain skeptical until the actual sales data gathered after the event. 

Dad proceeded to explain the parameters he was actively monitoring when he and mum scaled the meat distribution business in Singapore back in the early 80s

*High Level Heuristics*

    - don’t overinvest in infrastructure unless sales volume justifies it 

    - don’t over delay the investment in infrastructure as sales volume scales to such an extend it hampers growth 

    - the food distribution is a retention business more than it is an growth above all else business. Quality Control is hyper critical. ‎<This message was edited>
‎[10/24/23, 11:41:16 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/24/23, 11:51:14 PM] Gary Teh: he proceeded to share the scaling process both of them went through for their food distribution business in the 80s and 90s as well as the scaling process of 3 to 4 of the larger consumer brands in Singapore. 

Amazingly those brands went through the same process as we are doing right now. Two of them started with very very small batch of 5kg produce initially brought in from China

As I listen through the case studies he presented, it occurred to me that without realizing it, we have cracked a very critical component in the Agroverse network without realizing it. 

We have managed to successfully establish a trickling stream of inbound suppliers. 

And the virality baked right into the heart of our DAO is starting pull in more suppliers from regions of the world that we are targeting to source from for our Agroverse network. 

Once we successfully crack the buy side, my sense is the self compounding effect of our network and its virality will become more and more pronounced ‎<This message was edited>

[10/25/23, 12:00:57 AM] Val Lapidus: Let's think in the short term just the Bay area.  That has about 7million and is most comparable to Singapore.  The rest is far spread out
[10/25/23, 12:02:52 AM] Gary Teh: True. If we can establish a proper foothold in the Bay Are and stabilize it, we can start looking at LA next.

Portland thereafter

This city by city expansion pattern starts feeling a lot similar to  pattern described by @6598383264 that Chinese companies follow to expand across China 
    - tier 1 cities 
    - tier 2 cities
    - tier 3 cities

*Another key insight*
Enterprise customers they acquired initially came as consumers visiting their food stall at the wet market 

Enterprise customers once established will predictably order in bulk ‎<This message was edited>

It was a very interesting experience, I got my hands very dirty scaling a database as well as an entire ETL infrastructure to handle the crazy volume of data harvested from the open web

[10/25/23, 4:16:42 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is as soon as we figure out a way to get our imported cacao sold successfully in a reliable and repeatable manner, we should immediately start pursuing *these two action items* 

    *Action Item 1* - tokenizing the financing of the shipments 

    *Action item 2* - floating our governance tokens for sale by DAO members / buyback by DAO ‎<This message was edited>

Perhaps define what our DAO’s top 5 Business development agenda is 

Also what are the criteria’s for assessing fit 

That way we can rapidly pigeon hole in coming BD people to our DAO’s needs and then rapidly qualify or disqualify them ‎<This message was edited>

[10/26/23, 4:18:55 PM] Jonathan: @14153000019 i have been trying to keep up with the results of the sponsoring of the events. Sorry if I am missing a lot. Am I right that people love the cacao but hard to sell any at the events? Do you have a table with a sign where you try to sell with a big sign at the events? Do they let you do a quick talk before the speakers start about our DAO story? Do we have some charity that we give a very small percentage of the proceeds to like displaced children of Cocoa farmers or something? That can help in the beginning so people feel like by buying the cocoa they are also helping a cause on top of fighting the exploration of cocoa farmers.
[10/26/23, 4:26:58 PM] Jonathan: If you were providing cocoa at an event I was organizing I would put a small line in the poster saying ‘Hear the story of how TrueSight DAO is revolutionizing the supply chain for Cocoa farmers in Latin America and taste their product. I would give you five minutes at the beginning of the event to talk about the DAO. I would then give you a seat at a table on the side where you would put up your banner and sell your product. I am guessing this is along the lines of what is happening but just giving input from a web3 event organizer point of view.  I had you there selling product at a table then it would give some credibility to my event and it might attract other cool sponsors that wanted to sell their product

Somehow for @16468233438 it seems to be triggering the release of dopamine in his brain instead. 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

[10/26/23, 9:05:23 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to focus on what our goal is for each event.  You can't go to a tech event and try to sell cacao nibs.  You want to sell cacao names? We need to find a keto foods event.  At these events where it's tech events, the right path to approach is to gain Instagram followers and tell our message about how we utilize web3 for our project.  We are exploring also the idea of creating stalls for farmers markets where we will sell hot chocolate.  And then once proving out that use case that that is a profitable method, we will set up a franchising opportunity for others to open their own stalls within their own farmers markets

[10/28/23, 11:41:04 PM] Jonathan: I think you could follow the eggnog way - "If you would like to add alcohol to your eggnog, choose a drink with a high alcohol concentration to help counterbalance the sweetness of the eggnog.  Common choices of alcohol to add to eggnog include brandy, rum, bourbon or whisky."
[10/28/23, 11:41:43 PM] Jonathan: While brandy is the most traditional alcohol to pair with eggnog, according to traditional recipes, you can also use a mixture of dark rum and Cognac. If you like your eggnog with more of a kick you can also add bourbon, but we recommend sticking to rum and Cognac to preserve the 'nog's flavors
[10/28/23, 11:42:28 PM] Jonathan: Brandy: Makes the Most Traditional Eggnog
For the most traditional holiday experience, reach for brandy (specifically, Cognac) to spike your 'nog. It's important to note, though, that both brandy and eggnog are quite sweet. Combining them will produce something that someone with a sweet tooth will love, but that others may find cloying. Proceed with caution.
[10/28/23, 11:44:25 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Thanks for sharing! 🤩🙏

I noticed people get really sated after drinking 2 drinks of hot Choclate.

[10/30/23, 11:32:07 PM] Gary Teh: Started consuming this bar of magic mushroom laced chocolate (one small chunk every evening) which @17755088150 gifted me last Halloween when I was passing through Portland Oregon. It’s effect had been truly fascinating 

You literally feel nothing different than you would consuming a regular chunk of chocolate, but two three hours post consumption, patterns that were staring straight me in the face for a long long time that I have been blind to suddenly became obvious 🤯

My friend who is a master forager has been conducting master classes where he teaches people how to turn acorn into tortillas.  he charges USD80 per person and it’s a full class of 20 people for 6 hours. Basically USD1200 of net profit per session

I don’t see why we shouldn’t occasionally run classes where we charge the same amount for teaching people how to make choclate from cacao nibs 

It’s a novelty that even Jerry and his kids find fascinating enough to want to do everytime I go visit them 🤯

I wouldn’t mind moving front one hippie colony to the next conducting classes like these. It would be quite fun and not as equipment intensive as the idea that @16468233438 suggested 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/31/23, 7:48:53 AM] Gary Teh: I notice such kind of *psychological profiles* tends to not the most suitable as domestic partners, especially if they are expected to play the role of the *bread winner* in the domestic arrangement. 

Their ultra risk taking behavior tends to send their domestic partners scrambling in panic in the opposite direction as and when they go through one of those *100% conviction* episodes 

Reminds me of Alex Honnold who is well know for his free solo activities (rock climbing without use of safety harnesses)

What do you have in mind on how future events like this could fit into the much larger picture for our network effects to amp up the value of our governance tokens?? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/2/23, 9:23:15 AM] Iwona Fluda: We are planning to organize similar events globally in the coming months, so there is lots of potential, including but not limited to:
[11/2/23, 9:23:38 AM] Iwona Fluda: here are the ideas that Chat GPT gave me:
    Token Integration: Incorporating governance tokens into the fabric of the summit activities, allowing participants to earn tokens through meaningful contributions, engagement in discussions, and by providing valuable feedback.

    Community Building: Using the tokens to build a sense of ownership and community among the attendees. This can encourage ongoing participation and investment in the network, as each member will have a stake in the collective success.

    Knowledge Sharing: Facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices through a tokenized platform can ensure that the value generated at the summit extends beyond the event itself, contributing to a growing body of collective intelligence.

    Collaborative Innovation: Encouraging participants to propose and develop projects that align with the summit's goals, with governance tokens acting as a means for the community to vote and decide on the projects they find most promising.

    Continuity and Growth: By connecting each event to the next through governance tokens, we can create a continuous loop of value creation and sharing. This can lead to more significant advancements and breakthroughs in the fields we are passionate about.

    Network Expansion: As the community and its governance token system mature, the network effect can attract more talent and resources, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that grows in value with each event and interaction.
[11/2/23, 9:23:39 AM] Iwona Fluda: :D
[11/2/23, 9:23:44 AM] Iwona Fluda: What do you think?
[11/2/23, 9:35:13 AM] Gary Teh: Surfacing tasks required by our DAO at the event that participants can engage in to earn governance tokens would be great! 🤩🙏

What are the type of folks that have signed up so far?
[11/2/23, 9:45:22 AM] Iwona Fluda: geniuses, visionaries and in general amazing individuals 🌟
[11/2/23, 11:03:05 AM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Event is posted to start at 4pm. Speaking section will start around 5. So 4ish a good. Thanks!
[11/2/23, 11:22:05 AM] Gary Teh: Got it. See you there! 🙂🙏
[11/2/23, 11:22:18 AM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks!
[11/2/23, 11:22:43 AM] Gary Teh: Do you have a profile list handy? That way we can start shortlisting a bunch of quests we can immediately surface at the event
[11/2/23, 12:07:06 PM] Iwona Fluda: No, we`re not sharing the profile list of the participants.
[11/2/23, 12:07:37 PM] Iwona Fluda: I need to discuss it all with my business partner on Monday.

[11/3/23, 10:42:08 AM] Suheil - Europe: It's an accelerator program
[11/3/23, 10:42:10 AM] Suheil - Europe: Market Making Pro and WOW Summit have launched the WOW Summit Growth Program with a grant of 1,000,000 USD for founders, as well as the MMPro Experts Program for WEB3 industry professionals.

Details can be found here: Market Making Pro Experts Press Release

Participating projects receive additional benefits, including:
1. Evaluation of projects by leading industry experts.
2. Consultations on projects from Pre-seed to Series B.
3. Bonuses and opportunities for all participants during the bull run.
4. A grant of up to $1 million USD from the MMPro team.
5. A 15% discount from WOW Summit on all sponsorship packages and two standard tickets.
6. Informational support from key partners of WOW SUMMIT and MMPRO.

To start the Expert Audit, we need to gather and compile information about your projects for the Experts.

➡️ Fill out the participant form
[11/3/23, 10:46:00 AM] Gary Teh: I noticed the traditional jargon for the use of *founder* seem to be very pervasive 

Besides calling all governance token holders *contributors* we should just call them *founders* well

So technically we have close to 300 governance token holders (aka founders)

Just go ahead and apply as you would a *founder* 🤣

I noticed that @14152032783also listed @13104674556 as founder on the event sheet created for this Sunday’s event 

@16468233438 also asked if he could use the founder title at some point 

Let’s just democratize the use of the term *founder* within our DAO 🤩

You are all *founders*… 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/3/23, 5:46:50 PM] Alessandro Mele: Curious to see how the “Source principles” would apply to Agroverse ….. according to the theory developed by Peter Koenig there is only One Source for any human project or initiative, the person who has the idea and takes the first step / risk to make it happen. The Source then invited other people into the “field”, the vision for the project / initiative, in order to realise it. People come in as either other sources (realising their own idea / vision within the field) or employees (simply providing time / talent for salary). How did the idea of the DOA started? Who took the first step to realise it?!
[11/3/23, 5:48:58 PM] Gary Teh: Well, I guess that is where we should check our ledger 🤣

https://Edgar.TrueSight.me/ledger
[11/3/23, 5:50:20 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO has went through a bunch of evolution 

Initially a few key principles were just surfaced during random conversations and they somehow started forming a *Mandelbrot pattern* which just kept on growing on its own

Those key principles have been applied by the various individuals independently for along time prior. But somewhere somehow they collided within the network and the crystallization started happening ‎<This message was edited>

@13104674556 whose family had been in the cacao business mentioned it was one of the highest quality cacao he has ever sampled 

He also mentioned it’s very child friendly 

@16504369509 mentioned if it’s to be received by the American palette it needs to be way sweeter  than it currently is

Will upload and share the photos later 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/5/23, 8:48:15 PM] Jonathan: Nice. more pictures?
[11/5/23, 8:48:42 PM] Jonathan: Do we have a roll up banner that you use when selling?
[11/5/23, 8:49:34 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. @16468233438 got one printed 🙂🙏
[11/5/23, 8:49:42 PM] Jonathan: Last time I made about 10 of the and brought them to the US which was not fun. The difference in cost though is big. $200 in the US vs $13 in China. However, there is a huge difference in quality.
[11/5/23, 8:50:06 PM] Jonathan: I understand why they are so expensive in the US as they are very sturdy with great covers.
[11/5/23, 8:52:02 PM] Jonathan: Great. If someone is every going to HK, I would be willing to make some here in Shenzhen and hand them over for return in the US if we are still doing things cheap and cheery at that point. Something to keep in mind as the sales expand to more than one city.
[11/5/23, 8:55:32 PM] Gary Teh: I believe if we do successfully scale sales the next thing we will  be looking at is getting our packaging printed in Shenzhen
[11/5/23, 9:02:08 PM] Jonathan: sounds good.

[11/5/23, 10:10:57 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thanks @14153000019 & @16468233438 for agroverse representation tonight. The hot chocolate was a big hit and I honestly can say it’s one of the best I’ve had. You have something going there with the project and product.
[11/5/23, 10:11:39 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : Thank you @13104674556 and @16504369509 for your expert discussion on our panel. It was an amazing experience hearing your perspectives.

[11/6/23, 8:13:31 AM] Dan: Great connecting last night Gary!

The sweetness reference was more for if the cocoa was explored for use in our street outreach in the Tenderloin. Overall I felt the sweetness of the hot cocoa last night was perfect for me. I’m sure there’s plenty more taste testing to be had and learning from others but I loved last night’s offering. Thanks for brewing it up @16468233438 🙏

*hypothesis*
- Retailers have specific manufacturers they work with instead of producing the chocolate themselves 

- Manufacturers would be inclined to purchase the cacao nibs and keep them in stock ‎<This message was edited>

[11/6/23, 9:00:10 PM] Gary Teh: My sense as I have mentioned to @918017107841 a few times is that as we continue to compound our DAO’s network effects the sheer size of the network will over time by itself draw a lot of L1 chains to come after us

We don’t need to waste our time chasing after them 

I keep hearing the phrase: “*_this is a real use case for blockchain_*” mentioned over and over again when interacting with the tech community in the Web3 space ‎<This message was edited>

[11/8/23, 10:51:55 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has recently exercised her *autonomy* to create a new Wix based website for our main community site at TrueSight.me as Shadi has been busy with work and couldn’t find time to continue building out the Wordpress based community site 

I think her efforts at exercising her *autonomy* to creatively solve a problem was commendable 🙂🙏
[11/8/23, 10:53:27 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, more of these *autonomous* actions are beneficial for our DAO and also encourages *Diversity* within our ecosystem 

*Diversity* is one of our core values

[11/8/23, 9:03:58 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform 

What a match made in heaven!! 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/9/23, 10:50:24 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s get his and Micheal’s feedback 

If they feel receptive enough about it then we can trail tested it
[11/9/23, 10:58:56 PM] Gary Teh: I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

Just some random ideas to popped into my mind just now 🤷‍♂️🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/10/23, 1:15:22 AM] Iwona Fluda: The question is if they were warned about next steps/ if they were aware of this possibility. If not, I fully understand them. 

I understand that it sometimes seems that we live in a “cancel culture”, but I totally don’t get why we shouldn’t act differently individually and collectively. - just a thought. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 1:19:56 AM] Gary Teh: They probably thought the rules that were voted into our constitution/white paper did not apply to them or thought they could probably get away with breaking rules once these have been voted into place 

Or they came into the ecosystem before those ruled were put in place and did not bother to keep abreast of rule changes that have been voted into effect 

The folks that stuck around modified their behavior to fit the rules once informed 

Those that left because they suddenly realized there was no more value to be derived and there was nothing they want to contribute in the first place. They were just in here for sales lead generation to power their own business models. 

They opted to leave. Though we do have a three strikes and you are out policy. They did not even get to strike 2 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 1:22:45 AM] Iwona Fluda: So the question is to all of us: Do you read all the terms and conditions when you join a group of people?
[11/10/23, 1:23:13 AM] Gary Teh: That is a very good question 🤣
[11/10/23, 1:24:32 AM] Iwona Fluda: When we talk about strikes: which rules did I break that it caused me being kicked out of the Agroverse Guilt without warning?
[11/10/23, 1:24:58 AM] Gary Teh: Notice how the trickle in of folks in our channels have slowed recently?

I started requiring prospects keen to join our channels to read our white paper to understand our rules first
[11/10/23, 1:25:26 AM] Gary Teh: You were not being kicked out but rotated out 

The guild have a different set of rules that were voted in  

A maximum capacity of 8

When a new active members need to join, the least active is invited out 

All the other seven were active on some ongoing tasks ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 1:27:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: With 7 people in that group now. I just try to understand the rules.

[11/10/23, 1:33:56 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. @557391090002 was recently invited out because when we did an audit amongst ourselves he had no active scope 

Happy to introduce 1 more guild member who can commit time on a weekly basis in there.  

I know @972543523823 would be the 8th person but @31641075825 basically interfaces all the communications for her and she rarely goes into group chats

I am aware Emelin is trying to onboard a new designer she can work directly with. Not sure if that 8th should be used for him since feels like Emelin will be interfacing with the new designer if he wants to join 

But otherwise from what I am aware of so far we need these two additional roles

_Role 1_
a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>
[11/10/23, 1:38:01 AM] Gary Teh: Happy for anyone who would like to exercise *autonomy* by defining a active role for himself/herself to take on within the scope of Agroverse to join the guild to help advance the  project 🙂🙏

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

_PS: Also please don’t self define a role of being a manager to oversee other members._

_The guild size is small enough that members should be able to self manage and self execute once given the instructions manual on how to operate some functions_ 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/13/23, 12:02:05 AM] Gary Teh: *Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/13/23, 12:12:22 AM] Gary Teh: Speaking of brutal, Open Sea just laid off 50% of their employees 2 days ago.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-staff-severance-version-2-0-launch

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.

[11/14/23, 12:20:16 PM] Gary Teh: Additional insights from Ray Wu (Y-Combinator Alumni) 

*key insights*
    - tech scene is so abysmal right now no one wants to think about it that is why a lot of tech folks are looking into the FnB space 

    - VCs don’t really do much except _sell the money_ they took from someone else (_Limited Partners_) for hopefully at least a 3X return to keep their job. They market themselves as _value adding_ to try sell their money at a premium to unsuspecting founders but actually not much value add in hindsight

- people come in at seed and pre-seed with the belief in the _greater fool theory_ that someone will buy out their position at Series A for a 3X return. 

- bulk of the rich folks belong to the NATO category by default (_no action talk only_). See them for what they are. Tap on their network of relationships if applicable otherwise be judicious in deployment of operator’s (_person who actually executes_) time beyond what is necessary to maintain the relationship ‎<This message was edited>

[11/18/23, 9:08:22 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that the cooperative we are working with in Brazil have been actively exploring this concept with a supposed tech solutions provider while I was there

Unfortunately based on what I understood later on, the tech solutions provider ghosted on them... (_ghosting seem to be a prevalent phenomena in the web3 space… I had even offered to meetup with the tech solutions provider to explore collaborate while I was there… but to no avail…_) 

The upside is, once we have proven the end to end model for Agroverse that door is right now left wide open for us to step right in to fill up that gaping hole left by the tech solutions provider. 

According to our new _4 rules rubric system_ we should in principle award governance token to the tech solutions provider that ghosted on the cooperative. 

This is because he did spend time educating the market on our behalf… he just did not deliver on his promise… 🤔🤣

[11/21/23, 3:37:02 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s play the devils advocate.

Supposed we have you (a DAO member) introduced to the coop and you have visited the coop, you right now have the relationship 

Why would you not want to go renegade but instead want to continue incurring the overhead that the DAO charges on each transaction 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/23, 3:38:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Because I believe in the DAO.  People who manage the relationship with the co-op need to be trusted members of the dao
[11/21/23, 3:39:36 PM] Gary Teh: So basically DAO members helping maintain the relationship with the coops need to strongly align with the core values, purpose and mission of the DAO? 

Fair enough 

We need to really filter for these qualities during new DAO member interviews ‎<This message was edited>
[11/21/23, 3:41:07 PM] Gary Teh: The first thing that Ray immediately identified when he understood how the model works is that there needs to be a high level of trust amongst members within our DAO

[11/26/23, 3:42:18 PM] Gary Teh: Something I observed about the way work is structured around these work session teams at the Zen monastery I have been studying these past few days

*_simplicity*_
The task at each position is simple and well defined. Which allows easy build up of muscle memory after 3-4 iteration by a person executing that the role

Also the number of roles are very very limited since the overall scope of operations was deliberately kept to a minimal as is the signature characteristic of Zen inspired designs 

*_ease of role switching*_
Since these roles are designed to be simple, anyone could easily swap in and swap out of those roles (_which happens on a weekly basis_). 

This also makes it possible for a guest student who has just joined the community for a 2 week period to quickly get into the hang of any assigned role after 2-3 days and start being productive by day 4

*_pairing*_
Someone more experienced in a role is paired with someone new to a role. 

I have observed similar process before in engineering teams called _pair programming_ where an engineer more experienced with a codebase is paired up with an incoming engineer that is new to the codebase to quickly onboard the new engineer 

*_redundancy*_
There is a healthy level of redundancy built into the system design. 

7-8 people are loaded into a scope that could be easily handled by 3-4 people ‎<This message was edited>

Well worth reading for any one, especially for those interested in how good planning  and user experience can result in a better product, even when the ‘product’ is something of the scale of Changi airport or the port of Singapore.
[11/26/23, 8:33:55 PM] Gary Teh: Thank you for sharing 🙂🙏

[11/26/23, 9:12:21 PM] Gary Teh: Well.. seems it’s less intense here than the *_Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat_* which clocks *_10 hours per day*_. 🤣

Based data collected from the past seven days, it is an average of only 5 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day. Plus another 5 hours of meditation while actively attending to simple chores around the temple and the farm.

One thing I am really curious would be to volunteer as a server for one of the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat once I get back to the Bay Area again after my upcoming trip to Davos. 

That will help give first hand knowledge on how the logistic side of Vipassana retreat works (_heard from @14153096839 that no one is allowed to talk there even as a server_) 

And then as a third data point, finally attend the workshop conducted at the Spiritual Science Research Foundation in Goa as recommended by @41765663130 

My hypothesis is in-depth _*qualitative analysis_* of three such system should help provide enough data points to help triangulate at a high level the key components needed for a volunteer based self managing and self sustaining organization. 🤔
[11/26/23, 9:13:29 PM] Gary Teh: With a *in-depth qualitative analysis* of seven such systems, the clusters (_key patterns_) should become very very apparent 🤩

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

This is especially both of you will be very heavily involved on the European side of the supply chain as well as Swiss association matters 

@31641075825 I am asking @41799155602 if the three of us could meet up at his place after me and @41799155602 finished visiting WEF in Jan 

That way we could really discuss about next steps for Europe

[12/2/23, 7:57:07 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 

@19209806391 will be visiting Kenya this year 

During this visit it is important that he be provided samples of macadamia nuts from your farm that he can bring back to USA for testing with the buyers in his network based in Wisconsin and then some for the network based in San Francisco 

If USA market is receptive and there is sufficient profit margin that makes it commercially viable for DAO to bring into USA via Agroverse infrastructure, I will pay a visit to your farm to certify it for imports into USA under USA government FDA regulation 🙂🙏

Meanwhile, while waiting for @19209806391 arrive please sort out the following 

   - export permits from Kenya government to leave port

    - source for freighting company that can handle the exporting ‎<This message was edited>

@19209806391 once you have the samples from @254700187599 and have arrived back in USA please have some of the samples shipped to @16468233438  in San Francisco 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 8:03:34 AM] Gary Teh: Part of the documentation for getting FDA certified requires that you list the all the steps from harvest to packing before shipping out to USA 

If you can get that ready prior to my arrival in Kenya to your farm that will greatly facilitate the process 🙂🙏

[12/7/23, 12:39:39 PM] Gary Teh: *_Observation at the Zen monastery*_

I had the opportunity to study how the *_sangha*_ (_monastic community_) works 

Specific forms occur at recurring specific time of the day, these are those:

    - communal food
    - study time 
    - meditation time 
    - housekeeping time 
    - operating chores 

The only thing that is compulsory for all to engage in is housekeeping 

As for the rest whether the residents all turn up for them it is up to the exercise of their *_autonomy*_

For residents who are keen the schedule is visibly displayed on the way 

I noticed not all monastic residents show all the time for all meditation or study sessions

But since all residents were self selecting they are generally motivated to follow the schedule which is designed to enhance their spiritual practice 

_*How that translates to DAO*_
Feel free to come up with a schedule and a meeting venue 

If DAO members are keen they can turn up 

If DAO members are not keen they don’t need to turn up 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/7/23, 1:44:49 PM] Anupa/diya: Given the fact that everyone is professionally engaged with other things, some kind of dedication and commitment needs to be there to respect people s time. That's a part of integrity.

[12/7/23, 3:45:27 PM] Gary Teh: I am exercising my *Autonomy* by minimizing my FaceTime for now

When I look at my personal historical data collected over the past 12 months, these FaceTime sessions somehow always occur right when US stock market starts trading. 

The personal cost (_disrupted trades amounting to more than USD20K_) of these FaceTime far outweighs the value generated so far 🤔

I conclude asynchronous communication works best for me. 

Also asynchronous communications allows the space for the messenger to deliver the full message and then ample time for me to fully read and contemplate on the message before replying

Finally side observation these past three weeks, when I deliberately step back, it creates the space that allows other DAO members to step forward. I observed this too as a common practice here in the sangha ‎<This message was edited>

It is thus not *_sympathy*_ but *_empathy*_ 

*_Sympathy*_: I have never experienced your type of suffering. I don’t really feel how you are feeling. I am just doing a donation right now just to feel good about myself. 

*_Empathy*_: I have been through that same type of suffering and I know how painful it is. I can feel it right now myself just by seeing your suffering. I am naturally triggered to stop the pain. 

You are experiencing the physical pain. We are both experiencing the psychology pain.

Rather than attempt to sell it perhaps just order as much as possible and then store them somewhere in our decentralized warehousing facility  

Buyers will come knocking on the door at some point when they realize our prices have became competitive just because of market price changes

Then we can start offloading the cacao from our network of warehouses

DAO members get compensated for storage 

Based on my understanding from the folks from the cooperative, Cacao butter can technically be store forever 

Also an active sales team is no longer needed. We just need yo find more folks who are keen to offer their place for cacao storage purposes ‎<This message was edited>

And let’s see if the three of us could find some partners to help support @120363044028036610@g.us to save our rainforest 

From my perspective, if we don’t find channel partners for this effort during our upcoming visit to Davos then I really don’t know why I am trading precious time that could be spent having a reunion dinner with my dearly loved ones in Singapore attending something that doesn’t really drive any of our DAO’s projects forward 🙂🙏

[12/12/23, 10:35:25 AM] Gary Teh: DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them. 

_*Laymen terms*_
_I spend 1 million dollars to save rainforest. Rainforest is still dying. I feel very demotivated_

_I spend 1 dollar to save rainforest, a huge section got restored. I feel very motivated_ ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 11:58:35 AM] Gary Teh: My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

[12/12/23, 2:42:28 PM] Gary Teh: Negative statements are more *qualifiers* than they are *action rules*. 


_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples 


_scenario with qualifer and actual action associated_

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree. 

- *key action*: gather apples from apple trees in garden 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck the blue apples ‎<This message was edited>

[12/13/23, 5:15:07 PM] Gary Teh: Spent past 4 hours creating Python script to automate scoring of Member submissions into WhatsApp channels utilizing OpenAi

_*Location of code base*_
- https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/contribution_scoring/blob/main/Sandbox.ipynb



_Scoring for Beer Hall submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrMUTuzUz6rzVoZCoh2FhTfGXraCbybs3zzfnC1tTV8/edit#gid=69760546

_Scoring for Town Hall Submissions since last tokenization effort_
- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GQg09aFTlyUNez3w1GHX4GCQ6b1P3jaUz52z29TUHcw/edit#gid=2120247626



_*Key Takeaways*_
- some levels of false positives were observed (_work was not done but TDG was awarded_)
- ⁠Did not observed much false negatives (_work was done but TDG was not awarded_)
- ⁠There were instances where statements made by DAO members were so impacted, OpenAi by-past our 4 rules based rubric system and went ahead to award TDG tokens
- ⁠This feels like a more scalable approach to contribution scoring as compared to utilizing 100% human effort



_*Proposed Next Steps*_
- Please glance through the outputs and comment any submissions that you would like to flag for false positive or negatives⁠
- ⁠Score submissions in the other channels
[12/13/23, 6:09:41 PM] Gary Teh: _thoughts for some far fetched future_

What will be interesting at some point would be to notarize all these submission records on to our own TrueChain (_Proof of Authority based EVM variant_) 

Records to be tokenized will be approved by one of the *_10 Governors*_ system appointed each season. There will be a user interface provided where governors can indicate their approval

Once governor indicates approval, TDG tokens on TrueChain will be automatically issued to DAO member’s Metamask wallet address on file 

DAO member can opt to keep their TDG holdings on TrueChain or request for DAO to have their TDG holdings transferred to either the Solana or Ethereum chain

[12/19/23, 11:23:01 PM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I think we can test it out across different demographics.

We have a new breed of millennial farmers that might be quite receptive. Their approach to agriculture is different.

*Integrity* of DAO will evolve to become crowd sourced amongst DAO members and enabled using AI.

Let’s just propose for millennial farmer friends of yours who plant new trees on their property, to take a photo of the new tree they planted and then emailed the photo to support@agroverse.shop. If they do, they will be awarded governance tokens in our DAO.

That is the minimal action that we should verify can be easily adopted.

Their action will by default provide us with the following details

- email address of farmer
- ⁠Date time stamp (embedded in email header)
- GPS location of tree (embedded in photo attachment)
- ⁠image of tree (embedded in photo attachment) ‎<This message was edited>
[12/19/23, 11:50:58 PM] Gary Teh: Later on when we have an AI listening in on a WhatsApp channel, we could have the behavior even more seamless, they could just text the photos to the WhatsApp phone number associated with the AI. Once they do, the scoring gets automated.
[12/20/23, 12:00:33 AM] Gary Teh: Based according to the principles of the @120363044542957540@g.us , Users should not be forced to behave any differently from how they already are right now 

However what happens in the background should be quietly shifted over to the new paradigm without the need of their awareness

Reminds me of this Zen proverb: “_Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water._

_After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water_.”

[12/20/23, 9:20:36 AM] Gary Teh: Had a 10 minutes chat with @16468233438 just now

Seems their minimal order quantity is 100KG and their price point is nothing more than USD6 per kg 

We been reexamining the cost components of our supply chain

Seems we are paying a lot more for freighting than we are for the cacao itself 

The freighting is still using diesel which is not very environmentally friendly supply chain wise 

@16468233438 floated the idea of perhaps owning our own ship. 

@41765663130 mentioned he is planning to sail the carribeans end of January and then head over to Columbia to visit the indigenous

[12/24/23, 3:13:41 AM] Dr. Denis: Even „climate apocalypse“ zealots are against carbon credits because they think that those credits divert money from their dubious „climate actions“ 😅 Besides, it has been known for many years that voluntary carbon credits is just a greenwashing scam by design because they fail to meet additionality criteria

[12/24/23, 3:24:13 AM] Dr. Denis: I think there should be another type of credits to account for positive social impact, e.g. amount of joules/kWh/calories supplied to society as useful reliable energy and healthy food ‎<This message was edited>
[12/24/23, 6:33:50 AM] Gary Teh: Very insightful article. Thank you for sharing 🙂🙏 

It suggests redirecting resources to support indigenous and farmers as an alternative 

And for companies to start focus on actually cutting emissions instead of planting trees to get more credits (_*green washing*_) ‎<This message was edited>
[12/24/23, 7:00:23 AM] Dr. Denis: Excatly! it's not only this article, but all people who are familiar with carbon trading mechanisms are calling to stop greenwashing with fake voluntary carbon offsets. This publication is even more informative  https://phys.org/news/2023-10-carbon-capture-tree-plantations-threaten-tropical.html
[12/24/23, 7:58:32 AM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 

Large scale tree planting initiatives for carbon capture purposes often *_disrupt the existing biodiversity*_ in the ecosystem where they are planted 

*_Diversity*_ is one of our core values
[12/24/23, 8:48:04 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 spent 30 minutes explaining the USSD protocol that is popular amongst Kenyans as opposed to mobile applications 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data

Cost of the following types of trees saplings 

_We have nurseries that do the grafting and nurturing where we make our purchases_.

- Macadamia - 300 kes
- Avocado - 350-450 kes
- Wambugu apple - 1000 kes
- Peach - 10000kes

_All fruit trees come with different prices._
[12/24/23, 8:49:15 AM] Gary Teh: @254700187599 spent an hour gathering the following information for @120363044028036610@g.us for macadamia nuts 

I am sorry for sharing this in your inbox, it is too much for the hall.


From farmers, the prices have been varying from 80kes to 100kes per kg of the raw product. I will share a photo from our farm.

However, depending on the level of value addition the bags in supermarkets go for 600kes to over 800kes for 250grams. This value add is typically roasting and salting.

For the very premium ones, they go for as high as 250 kes for 30grams.

I will share some photos below.

I requested a quote from an epz that does the cracking of the nuts in tonnes. I am waiting for their response.

Town hall was a spin off to ensure important message were not lost when Peter Peng was still active in DAO and was flooding Beer Hall with messages about his Ukrainian girl friend and weapons collection. Since he has left noise level has dropped

[12/27/23, 9:44:42 PM] Gary Teh: He left of his own accord 🤷‍♂️

I would have enjoyed the back and forth between him and @6590995199 

Anyways he seems too busy with his GptProtocol project which is going quite well 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 9:58:08 PM] Gary Teh: I am noticing a recurring pattern… 

ideas and discussions happening in DAO being taken and incorporated into members own independent project 

The most recent one that got surfaced by @41799155602 this morning was by Satheesh (the Ahan project) which borrowed from RnD materials done in Agroverse. The Ahan deck was sent to @41799155602 for fund raising purposes. 

Until @41799155602 surfaced this, I had no idea Satheesh was approaching supporters of Agroverse project to seek financing for an alternate project that had borrowed RnD materials from Agroverse.

This copy and paste phenomena seems to be common in the realms of open source too

_PS: at this point, I am leaning towards being skeptical about the DAO model as a *equitable way* to crowd source for resource to build community projects as the same flaws which exist in open source software operating models are starting to surface in DAO ecosystem as well_

_microsoft for years have been copying and pasting code created in open source projects to build up their OS. Bulk of the market capitalization ended up getting attributed to Microsoft and none of it ever end up getting attributed to these open source efforts_

_as @5511982667030 correctly identified DAO seems to be like a leaky bucket in terms of value generation and capture… value is generated by collective effort but seems to keep getting captured elsewhere_

_I am right now holding off on pouring more personal resources into this leaky bucket until a better alternate variant is discovered…_

_at least it is good to discover a model that doesn’t really work well. This helps us free resources to figure out other models that might work 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 10:23:47 PM] Gary Teh: If I was a hustler the way I would exploit this network would be to download the entire member contact list and then reach out to every single one of them individually to help  finance my own project… the common term for this phenomena is called “_contacts mining_” as described by @41799155602

However since bulk of the folks here were invited by me into our DAO from my personal network, there is technically no one new for me to *_social mine*_ 🤣 

So whether this DAO continue to exist or not doesn’t really matter for me from a networking perspective as my personal relationship with everyone here will still continue existing regardless 🤔

I think the primary reason for this persistence is I did spent ample time to really know each and every person here as a human being. 🙂🙏

I feel it’s important we learn to stop just treating the next person beside us as just another tool. 

What I observed these three months crashing into some of the networking events in Bay Area just makes me cringe as a human being. 😵 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/27/23, 11:29:20 PM] Kelvin Chew: lol he is a waste of time
[12/27/23, 11:57:48 PM] Vlatko Gigov: This usually happens when you practice maximum transparency. Which has been the case with the DAO since the beginning. It is fine if we are here to support one another and produce spin offs through our participation and chit chat. @5511982667030 rightly points to the leaky bucket analogy. I guess one needs the validation of 100s of ppl to go off on a tangent. Which is again fine. As long as the initial values are preserved. Usually in the begging values are instilled either with an iron fist or a legal bind. Let’s see if we can instil them the hippie way.
[12/28/23, 12:01:32 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The vote surfaced is fine, but I think there should be a task force which works on operations and only reports major milestones to the larger group and addresses the group when there is decisional crossroad.
[12/28/23, 12:02:12 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Of course @14153000019‘s posting doesn’t apply in this restriction, but it does need to be modified a little bit.
[12/28/23, 12:03:36 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The projects being developed here are addressing current problems and sometimes similarities are apparent.
[12/28/23, 12:04:09 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s see what the collective wisdom of this multi year exercise provides as a solution to this apparent problem.

[12/29/23, 4:09:23 PM] Gary Teh: Spoke with Angela (_center of photo_) just now while driving her to the gem wholesaler in my car

She handmakes these marijuana pipes that she sells to the weed shops here for a very high margin

She doesn’t want to waste her time hand making them but doesn’t feel confident about finding a supplier that could do it in China that she could trust

I mentioned that I might be popping by China and know a bunch of folks there sometime this year (@8618926086648… _wink wink_…) and we could source for the manufacturer

Might actually pop by to source for a Kraft pouch printing supplier based in China if @120363044028036610@g.us sales volume does go up (_at some point_) 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

Spent bulk of today exploring the world’s largest wholesale precious gem fair! 🤩

And it’s totally amazing!! Also managed to bump into an ex-Olympic USA swimmer. She mentioned she will be in Paris to volunteer at the swimming event during summer this year! 

Time spent: 4 hours 

Key insights 

- each spot on the open desert rents for 15 days 

- ⁠renting period officially begins 1 January and last through to February 

- ⁠none precious gen vendors set up as early as October 

- ⁠USA precious gem miners typical work 11 months in a year mining the land they have contracted with state and county until weather turns ultra bad before they seek refuge here in QuartzSite

- ⁠retail price is typically a 100% markup on whole sale price

- ⁠other places where precious gem are sourced from: China, Brazil, Uruguay and Afghanistan

[1/4/24, 11:20:42 PM] Gary Teh: Establishing another distribution channel

My sense is simply lace as many sales and marketing channels as possible on to this and see where the conversion rate actually happens
[1/5/24, 1:39:20 AM] Iwona Fluda: Because, it is beer hall, some news here:
The book: Activate Your Life, Vol. 4 for which I wrote a chapter, 'Creative Bites: The Dance of Ideas, Sky, and Trust,' along with other authors, has just hit the bestseller lists on Amazon. Still just today you can download the kindle version of this book and 3 previous volumes for free. 🌟

[1/5/24, 8:05:51 PM] Gary Teh: Now that we have established market price for our (_freely available_) clay supply, this becomes really interesting 🤔🤩

We could technically start backing our governance tokens with clay which technically has an indefinite storage period compared to organic materials like cacao and we technically don’t even need to worry about people stealing our clay since there are tons of those where those came from. 🤩

Also since the whole site is full of trash, no one will every want to develope the land for commercial purposes because government ordinance  require that they spend millions of dollars cleaning up the trash (_accumulated over 50 years 🤯_) before they are even allowed to ever build anything on it..  😱

Everytime we sell this freely available commodity on Amazon or to one of our distributors our fiat deposit increases. And our supply is technically protected by the U.S. government 🤔🤣

[1/8/24, 7:39:19 AM] Iwona Fluda: Hi everyone! I've established several media partnerships with organizations during the Davos week, including with the Climate Hub: https://creativeswitzerland.com/climate-hub-davos-x-creative-switzerland/. If you're interested in being featured across our diverse media channels and gaining access to an international audience, please feel free to reach out. This is a unique opportunity to showcase your organization and initiatives and connect with a global network. Looking forward to potentially collaborating with you! Cheers & see you in Davos!

P.S. For one of the events, I also created digital art pieces to be visible on their screen, if you would like to discover more about it and consider it for your events, have a look here: https://creativeswitzerland.com/creative-bites-digital-art-by-iwona-fluda/  

You can also find me on Linkedin here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fluda/
[1/8/24, 7:39:36 AM] Iwona Fluda: P.S. Who is in Davos next week?
[1/8/24, 7:42:46 AM] Gary Teh: Very very cool! Perhaps feature Agroverse cacao nibs and how this effort attempts to help regenerate our Atlantic rainforest 🙂🙏

@41799155602 @41765663130 @41765737357 and myself will be there

@120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs will be shared at Davos

How much land have you gotten for the money?
[1/9/24, 4:09:39 PM] Gary Teh: 2.5 acres 🤩

Should be enough to run whatever off grid experiments we have in mind to get to some form of prototype ‎<This message was edited>
[1/9/24, 4:31:44 PM] Tomas - Offchain: that is for the btc miner or cacao related?
[1/9/24, 4:37:02 PM] Gary Teh: BTC miner… 

And other stuff we can grow and mix into cacao to create derivatives or even create new product lines related to Agroverse theme
[1/9/24, 4:38:56 PM] Tomas - Offchain: it seems a good pricing, even for a do nothing retreat center

[1/11/24, 12:31:23 PM] Gary Teh: Nope. She doesn’t 

Let’s just test with the prevailing starting price on her and then offload at close of cost price 

From my perspective doesn’t really matter so long as we recoup our initial cost for AGL2 

Am thinking of experimenting with the auction model for contract AGL3: Tsukiji fish market edition 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/12/24, 9:58:22 PM] Anupa/diya: Saffron - Very commonly used in India. I think its used in tumeric latte s now. There is a huge market
[1/12/24, 10:07:54 PM] Gary Teh: Saffron is also very interesting because Iran is the world’s top produce and USA currently has a trade embargo on Iran

I understood that a lot of illegal Iran supplies are imported into USA via Spain

I remember easily fitting 5KG of cacao nibs into my backpack last year and then bringing it back into USA from Brazil as a commercial entry

Imagine replacing that cargo with saffron instead, I am literally walking across the border with USD10,000 worth of merchandise during each trip versus USD130 🤯 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/14/24, 10:33:12 AM] Gary Teh: Bhavana further elaborated on getting to oneness (_Seva - proper mental frame to be in when contributing in DAO_)

Self (1) + Divinity, aka choiceless awareness (1) = 2 

To get to 1 one of the two must be removed from the equation 

Not-self, aka Anatta (0) + Divinity, choiceless awareness (1) = 1

When anybody is doing anything make sure Nobody is Doing Nothing

[1/17/24, 5:13:59 AM] Gary Teh: Key insight identified 

- The shipping industry is very old and needs some refactoring 

- ⁠there is so much scam in the shipping industry banks no longer issue letter of credit 

- ⁠Greece is where a lot of shipping companies are headquarter 

- ⁠house of Greece has an industry event on shipping tomorrow

[1/18/24, 1:00:55 AM] Vlatko Gigov: The financing portion of the shipping industry is a major problem, one of the reasons why Credit Suisse failed. Just to put things in perspective what goes around LC. the highlight is 2021 - Archegos Capital Management: https://amp.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/21/tax-timeline-credit-suisse-scandals
[1/19/24, 1:49:53 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 yesterday at the Davos China Day 2024 in the Hari Krishna temple where @41799155602 shared with the investors circle about the following projects:

- @120363044542957540@g.us 
- ⁠@120363044028036610@g.us 
- ⁠@120363045796860099@g.us 

Time he spent sharing it: 30 minutes 

Seems earth.ship like projects are a common phenomena in his circles 

_PS: everyone went on a spiritual high after that_
‎[1/19/24, 1:50:09 AM] Gary Teh: ‎video omitted
[1/19/24, 2:01:25 AM] Gary Teh: Was with @41799155602 the day before at the Free Thinker Society where he and I shared about the concerns of the forthcoming @120363044542957540@g.us 

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

We spent 2 hours at the free thinker’s society 

_PS: @41799155602 observed the ripple effect on the dropping of this bomb. Economists independently brought this up during discussions at various panels they are part of_

[1/19/24, 2:08:11 AM] Gary Teh: Shared about @120363045796860099@g.us project and portions of @120363044542957540@g.us philosophy at the QnA session by sustainability projects documentary director  yesterday at the ClimateHub yesterday 

Time taken: 15 minutes

_PS: first comment director made after hearing this vision was “did you come from the future?”_

_My response “I came from the distant pass from the times of Lao Tzu, Buddha and Diogenes 🤣”_

_The vision of an alternate truly post industrial age decentralized lifestyle configuration that is sustainable and aligned with nature was a very thought provoking idea that drove a lot of curious people to approach thereafter_

_a Neo-hunter gathering lifestyle that is back by newly available technologies like solar panels, AI, IOT and blockchain mixed with traces of esoteric paganism_ ‎<This message was edited>

[1/19/24, 7:11:16 AM] Gary Teh: *_Observations made while aimlessly drifting through Davos_*:

Unacquainted strangers who made initial contact when presented with the same story (_stimulus_) either respond one way or the other 

- less and less excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠more and more excited as the story unfolds 

- ⁠folks involved in the crypto space visibly recoil as though just presented with a venomous snake after being presented with the keyword _DAO_ if and when they decide to pry further beyond the _Do Nothing_ stage of the story 

_Story_
- I Do Nothing but sometimes when the Calling to do so comes I contribute to projects managed and operated by a DAO

_Distinctive demographic differences_

- subjects who become less and less excited tend to be dressed in formal suits 

- ⁠subjects who grow more and more excited tend to be dressed in casual wear. Further observed is the more esoteric their garment looks the more rapid the rate by which they get excited 

Time taken to conduct this social experiment was 3 hours ‎<This message was edited>
[1/19/24, 7:15:42 AM] Gary Teh: Interpretation of signals 

- there is a community of people actively committed to _Seva (Do Nothing)_

[1/20/24, 2:44:49 AM] Gary Teh: Gifted a bag of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs to @41765663130 this morning for playing host this week 

He mentioned he might know someone that supplies cacao to the smaller choclate makers here in Switzerland 

I proposed for him and @41799155602 to have a chat as @41799155602 is overseeing the supply chain into Europe 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/20/24, 2:57:13 AM] Gary Teh: Had a dinner yesterday evening and breakfast this morning with @41765663130 and friends here in Davos where we discussed about @120363044028036610@g.us and @120363045796860099@g.us 

They mentioned they would be happy to make introductions when I arrived along the west coast of Africa where cacao is being cultivated. 

@120363045796860099@g.us has been particularly intriguing amongst friends as it was immediately labeled as an Elon Musk category project. 

these were the general themes surfaced during discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

[1/20/24, 3:02:28 AM] Gary Teh: Had one hour lunch with @41799155602 and friends at the Temple yesterday where discussions about @120363045796860099@g.us organically happened

_ideas surfaced_

- 3D printing using waste materials 

- ⁠solar powered 3D printing of construction materials 

- ⁠solar powered desalination of sea water

- ⁠there are lots of plastic (_construction material_) floating around in the ocean and they are naturally clustered together (_easy harvesting_) ‎<This message was edited>

_Key insights_

- it is possible to have *Integrity* (_core value_) without need for Transparency (_not core value_)

_Follow up action_

- future useful insights gathered that are not tokenizable will no longer be shared within these channels (_DM me if you are keen to find out where the category of untokenized  insights are published and shared_)

- ⁠this will further reduce the amount of post within our WhatsApp channels 

- ⁠if two or more DAO members are present, visual submissions will no longer be a requirement to prove that DAO contribution has transpired 

- ⁠Governors retain the right to request for proof when in doubt

[1/20/24, 4:10:37 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Finally we have come to the realisation of intentions. Looking forward to the upgrade of TSD. The governance model is evolving and DAO and TAO are gaining more and more traction the right way. “Train your psyche”
[1/22/24, 8:55:02 AM] Gary Teh: *discussion for the week*

what are your thoughts on the China wobbling economy on activities within our DAO? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/22/24, 8:55:16 AM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[1/22/24, 9:01:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Very interesting question, I’m eager to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially from people in that part of the world. Not an expert on Chinese economics. I only come across so much made in China stuff as i am sure you all do. Do we need all that? 🤔
[1/23/24, 3:14:47 AM] Alessandro Mele: Indeed really interesting question. I guess it depends on our exposure to the Chinese economy : do we have any members living there who might be affected? How do they see the situation and it’s impact on their lives? And do we have any partner or supply chain exposure there? There might be repercussions on the cost of supplies for instance or a reduction in sales from clients in the region. The fact that our DAO is a fairly small and agile organisation should make us resilient and flexible to adapt to chancing macroeconomic situations.
[1/23/24, 5:13:07 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Indeed. Looking at it from a macro perspective and how the majority of synthetic/petrochemicals products/by products come from China, the supply chain aspect will be affected. China could end up raising prices, to fill up the coffers. Leaving room for the cradle to cradle circular economy aspect to gain traction @41765737357 is an expert in c2c field. Very strong in the recycled packaging field. Might be interesting to explore partners in China who will adopt these practices… 

And of course when you throw the US in there as their best econ partner we could partially predict what’s going to come as long as we stay on the sustainability agenda. Let’s see what happens. It’s an election year across majority of the countries.
[1/23/24, 9:38:10 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Well, it is actually key to concern material health (safety) before recycling. It needs some innovations in materials…

[1/24/24, 9:13:37 AM] Gary Teh: @14152023011 could you share the performance of your automated crypto-currency trading strategy since  its inception 

Please list the following
- sharpe ratio
- ⁠largest drawdown
- ⁠time to recovery since largest drawdown 
- ⁠period in months fund has been running

Post LATOKENs listing in the very short run, we might end up having more liquidity that we could deploy for project build up purposes. It might make sense to deploy a small portion of the liquidity to be managed by your bot if the 4 parameters being inspected are up to par with our DAO’s requirements 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/24/24, 3:29:35 PM] Gary Teh: Me and @41799155602 spent 2 hour this evening doing a survey of cacao prices at the various supermarket chains here in Basel

[1/28/24, 4:03:39 AM] Minahil Alvi: Education is my current focus at the moment. With the Advent of AI, Education and the democratization of skills will greatly impact global economies. To tackle the upcoming challenge/opportunity. I have devoted the past couple of months to the inception of a platform called Tutorwith.ai - which helps Educators and Legacy Education Institutes utilize AI to create a more personalized learning experience for students and cut out the learning curve for millions of teachers worldwide.
[1/28/24, 4:07:14 AM] Gary Teh: What are some key challenges you encountered when applying AI towards the creation of personalized learning experiences for students? 🙂
[1/28/24, 4:16:16 AM] Minahil Alvi: The challenge actually starts with the teachers - In the Middle East specifically the average teacher spends 20 to 30 percent of their daily classroom time doing admin tasks such as (Lesson planning, student reports, Subject specific materials, etc) Tutorwith.ai automates these tasks leaving room for a more personalized educational experience. We are in the MVP stage of our platform and until now the feedback from teachers and educators has been overwhelmingly positive, indicating the importance of our mission and vision. (In short, the challenge we are anticipating might be on the adoption side of such a tool in the wider educational landscape)

[1/31/24, 6:21:21 AM] Anupa/diya: @554792591729 it is lightly explained on the current website. Maybe we can do a detailed version 

The contribution list will vary from project to project.
[1/31/24, 6:22:34 AM] Anupa/diya: We will have to simply the explanation for the non web 3 members. We will need to add that as well
[1/31/24, 9:34:07 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: sure, The IEO or initial exchange offering is a way to offer the token to early investors/traders. It is similar to a presale or ICO but it is done on the exchange.The price during the ICO is usually at a discount to the public sale price to reward early participants.It also allows projects to raise funds by selling a % of the token supply. It must be noted however that the exchange can't guarantee of how much funds may be raised.It is also used to market promote and create awareness of the project. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/31/24, 9:36:24 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The listing going live on the other hand would be setting up a trading pair on the exchange and make trading on the exchange possible right away.The listing will also include promotional campaigns to drive token adoption and community growth.
[1/31/24, 10:26:39 AM] Gary Teh: Based on the policy voted into effect, we are just planning to release 200,000 TDG for sale this IEO and listing 

All DAO members are already contributing at 1USD = 1TDG

What are your thoughts if we just made the token price at IEO to be the same rate and then thereafter allow market to decide what rate they want the prevailing TDG/USDT exchange rate to be at? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/31/24, 10:38:49 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: The market will eventually decide the rate, but there has to a price for the initial listing to have a starting point. After the first initial trades the price will be determined by market sentiment. I think a better way to do it is set whatever price you want the listing to be and have the IEO be at a discounted price, So an example could be to set the listing price at 1USD per TDG. Prior to the listing IEO participants can be given the chance to by at $0.80/TDG. Have a cap on the IEO say 75% of allocated tokens.The remaining tokens can be used for co-marketing activities and the liquidity for the trading pair. The trading pair can be opened with as little as $250TDG/$250USDT but the more liquidity the lower the less volatile the price will be and have better spreads on the buys/asks
[1/31/24, 10:44:14 AM] Gary Teh: I see

It might make sense to do the following

Pricing
- IEO at $1/TDG 
- ⁠list at $1.5/TDG 

Allocation volume 
- 150,000TDG for allocated IEO
- 50,000TDG allocated for release during listing time 

Anyone else have thoughts about this?
[1/31/24, 10:44:41 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Thise numbers are just for ilustration

Samantha the banker mentioned that she and her friends will be very keen to attend the Soil and Water festival that @34623502531 is organizing in Ibiza in May 

Seems the @120363044028036610@g.us storyline naturally flows into the soil and water festival theme

[2/2/24, 2:21:24 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Ok, someone would need to act as a representative in any case so we could add that later if you wish.
[2/2/24, 2:21:53 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: So the representative would need to provide a government id

[2/2/24, 9:13:38 AM] Gary Teh: By the way I spoken to @14438013886 yesterday, she mentioned shipping of mushroom growing kit to states where it is legalized is now possible and quite easy

[2/2/24, 3:44:48 PM] Gary Teh: As previously shared during Davos at the Hari Krishna temple, when I last did the math, 20ft container worth of mushroom basically yields around USD2 million every 3 months. If distributing wholesale, it’s around USd1 million every 3 months per 20ft container

We don’t really need much upfront investment. Just need to get a plot of land to setup the initial prototype 

Snowballing of the revenue from that will help scale the infrastructure. It’s basically another marketing and distribution problem ‎<This message was edited>

[2/3/24, 8:42:22 AM] Gary Teh: @447507059473 you might want to adjust this term before you get into trouble with your boss

The second USDT3000 is contingent on IEO raising more than that amount otherwise, there is no recourse on you receiving that amount from the DAO since all the DAO members will just become permanent residents in the @120363044542957540@g.us beyond that point and really Do Nothing 🙂🙏

A more feasible term would be up to USDt3000 contingent on the USDt amount being raised during IEO and the balance in TDG. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/7/24, 9:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: Greetings. I have been involved with a DAO based organisation called United Religions Initiative since 2008 and it was founded in 2000. For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this. It is the Proof of Point of DAO which is now 24 years old
[2/7/24, 9:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.
[2/7/24, 9:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: here is a snapshot of this framework, which can be transferred to out movements as well. Many others started out with same methodology, but only the URI survived 2008 and beyond to make a proof of point

[2/12/24, 9:09:09 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished an hour of facetime with @41786813052 

_Discussed_
- Green Up is a non-profit Swiss association
- ⁠Explored how Green Up operates projects and events in Switzerland
- ⁠One of the most popular workshop offered by Green Up to cooperations is how to live simply
- ⁠how foundations that provide financing to Green Up projects work

potential areas for interfacing
- Green Up has done a bunch of research on living simply and soil restoration. We could potentially utilize the research materials to identify prototypes we want to test and implement for testing in the SunMint Project. Those that we have tested to work in our SunMint project we can then compile as a handbook that Green Up could use in their workshops
- We could learn from operating processes that Green Up follows when running volunteer based events
- ⁠There has been a bunch of folks in our DAO that have proposed that I write a book at some point. I think the most useful book I could probably come up with right now is basically a blueprint that people can follow to implement the minimal carbon footprint off-grid setup I have right now. I will contribute that as materials to the workshop that Green Up workshop
- ⁠Foundations that Green Up is in communications with in Switzerland that are associated retailing distribution would be helpful for distributing Agroverse produce growing using environmentally restorative techniques. We should support the farmers ‎<This message was edited>

- ⁠Evangelizing an intentional day of Do Nothing as a movement! This we will more deeply explore in the @120363044542957540@g.us 🤩🙏

‎[2/15/24, 5:29:15 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: TrueSight DAO Governance_order_form_15_02_2024.pdf • ‎7 pages ‎document omitted
[2/15/24, 5:29:58 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity—facilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.
[2/15/24, 6:32:13 AM] Gary Teh: Could you indicate how much USDT and TDG it will be in total for listing. The agreement doesn’t indicate any of the amount 🙂🙏

[2/15/24, 9:22:32 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hi yes I will include that on the final doc. So in total it will be 50% of the total cost in USDT or $5,000. The other 50% in TDG $5,000 of TDG

60% will have to be paid before the IEO and the remaining 40%a fter the IEO before trading pair goes live.
[2/15/24, 9:32:03 AM] Gary Teh: We are short of USDT2000 with only USDT3000 in vault

[2/22/24, 9:10:20 AM] Anupa/diya: This is our first Edgar revamp Meeting. We brainstormed around the idea of financial literary and education. We also agreed that there is a definite need make people ( users still to be identified) more financial resilient for the future. There is a gap in the way people manage and build wealth and have less liabilities. It is something that fiat and crypto communities. If anyone is interested to know more about what we aim to do and want to join. Dm me or any one on the pic or @41799155602.

*The goals*

- to craft a simple script that works which we can then scale to onboard even more influencers. 

- ⁠to figure out the chinks to be ironed out during the onboarding process

[2/25/24, 9:02:34 PM] Gary Teh: Just made arrangements to be vending @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs and perhaps some hot chocolate and mushroom infused chocolate via partnership at Barter Faire in May up in Washington state 

https://youtu.be/VRK6-N-T4wg?si=qQ3UxghE84XMzVuH

Have also spoken with organizer to be onboarding van life influencers while we are there for an overriding commission of subsequent sales by influencers they bring onboard (_guess we are going down the MLM route on the direct to consumer side of the business after all_) 

_PS: Barter Faire is the largest  annual van life event in the entire USA. Spread across 40 acres with 20 acres reserved for vendors (_center camp_) and 20 reserved for visitors (_out skirts_) ‎<This message was edited>
[2/25/24, 10:25:42 PM] Nicole: @14153000019 does Barter mean swap and not sell? Or is it just an overall name. Would be curious
[2/25/24, 10:51:37 PM] Gary Teh: Is just a name

[2/27/24, 5:19:20 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello good day everyone.

I talked to the approvals team regarding the LATOKEN listing. For a short amount of time I can reduce the final price to 5k from 10 but it would have to be paid in USDT or other equivalent.

The main points are
*Can be listed for 5k total instead of 10k
*Needs to be USD 
*Can pay 3k in advance and 2K after IEO


If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.

[3/6/24, 12:08:08 PM] Gary Teh: So far we have reached out to 30 influencers. Averaging around 10 per day.
Influencer positive response rate was around 16%

An influencer who has accumulated a lot of followers based on her weigh loss journey would be someone that is perfect to showcase our cacao nibs. Since that is what alot of folks who follow a Keto diet end up consuming

Someone like influencer who started her weigh loss journey from 300lbs 
https://www.tiktok.com/@avila2680_?shop_region=US
[3/6/24, 4:49:54 PM] Gary Teh: 9 out of the 10 influencers we reached out today is fighting obesity. Some of them already having lost more than 100lb

Something clicked in my head just now when looking through this afternoon’s qualitative signals 

Each physical human body has a configuration range where it’s considered healthy. The body’s consciousness intuitively knows that

Nature does not do anything extraneous. When the body is healthy. It is naturally attractive regardless of biological age. 

These influencers from today’s marketing outreach efforts intuitively know their current configuration is not within the healthy range and trying to restore balance to their internal system 

Gaia (_the universe_) is attempting to restore balance not just in the rainforest but also in the human body ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/24, 5:01:40 PM] Gary Teh: When the world is healed with love, beauty is the by-product 

Consciousness intuitively knows beauty when it beholds it within its field of awareness.

Beauty can exist in the physical body or in the natural environment 

Beauty is a natural indicator of health within an organism as well as the ecosystem.

Consciousness is naturally drawn to love and beauty. ‎<This message was edited>

- Agroverse
- ⁠SunMint

_PS: The ecosystem has been hammered with the collapse of Alameda and FTX. Our original market setup on the Serum protocol was defuncted. We will need to set a new market up again on the OpenBook protocol once we are ready._

_Once setup our DAO can start performing open market buybacks from DAO members who are keen to sell off tokens which they have earned through their contributions_ ‎<This message was edited>
[3/14/24, 12:02:16 AM] Gary Teh: On the positive side, OpenBook protocol is primarily a community driven initiative

Creating the market for our tokens will require 3 SOL. 

We can exchange for SOL using USDT in our vault or USD profits we generated once when they do get generated

- food
- ⁠drinks
- ⁠drugs 

Hot chocolate in the morning when it’s cold 

Perhaps Cacao ceremony to bring in the crowd and then when they leave Drugs… aka marijuana infused chocolate for consumption or for external application 

Time taken to gather insight 30 minutes

And cultivation of edible desert plants in these vertical farms 

Adobe bricks could be made using the clay that is naturally found in the desert

These could also be used to build more *_Shrines of Emptiness*_ dedicated to *_Do Nothing*_ out here in the desert 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[3/20/24, 11:05:22 AM] Gary Teh: _*Murmurs from the USA cacao market_*

After rounds of feedback gathering that @16468233438 has conducted with the USA chocolatiers, and me with the USA consumers.

The taste of Gourmet cacao is more refined due to the additional care in the processing and thus pricier. 

USA chocolatiers are accustomed to working with the usual bulk cacao supplies and their corresponding price points.

The USA chocolate connoisseur knows quality when she taste it and is willing to pay premium price for it. 

*_Proposed path forward_*
Our mission is to heal the world with love and restore its beauty. In the case of our cacao nibs, restoring our rainforest. So long as we have the opportunity to help further increases the sales and distribution of  agricultural produce grown regeneratively by the farmers, we should go for it.


- Have two product lines targets at the different target segments

- ⁠*Gourmet cacao market segment* - targeted at the direct to premium consumer market segment - cacao ceremonies, medicinal ingredients infused cacao 

- ⁠*Bulk cacao* - targeted at chocolatiers who want to enhance their brand story by supporting our climate change efforts, but don’t want to incur the premium that comes along with the gourmet cacao process.

_PS: This seems to be the norm for other brands I had the opportunity to encounter_ ‎<This message was edited>

They’re about to plant 3000 cacao trees on Maui and open to the idea of tokenizing them too. Lmk thanks.
[3/20/24, 4:35:29 PM] Matthew K. Bowen: I created this WhatsApp group with the farmers in case anyone wants to talk Cacao or Hawaii, or any other subject of interest 👍

[3/22/24, 7:27:20 AM] Gary Teh: *insight from this morning’s 1 hour meditation*

After much curation within my personal network, looking back at 20 years of personal data as well as reading through the biographies of the top organization builders, the most important function within any organization with a commercial intent is *_Marketing (making money 💰💸💵💶💷💴🤑)*_

*_Sources*_
- Ryu - business developer
- ⁠Jerry Luk - President of Fireworks
- ⁠Peter Gwee - DAO member, 3 generation business man in the fenshui industry 
- ⁠Dad - third generation business man in the food distribution industry
- ⁠Vinod Nair - CEO money smart 
- ⁠Richard Brandon 
- ⁠Elon Musk
- ⁠@6598383264 

PS: when the *_marketing (making money)*_ function works wells, the rest of the function will automatically work well of their own accord 

Creators are drawn to a space because they enjoy the process of building a product. 

Paradoxically, to really be successful in a space, creators have to step away from the product development function and focus on the organization building itself and most especially through marketing function.

Creators that have been observed to struggle are those who cling on for too long to the product building instead of letting otters handle it. 

When the marketing function works well and starts bringing in 💴💷💶💵💸🤑, specialists from various functions will naturally get attracted into the organization to support in the other functions ‎<This message was edited>
[3/22/24, 7:30:53 AM] Gary Teh: Personally I am holding off on further deployment of efforts into the @120363045796860099@g.us

[3/22/24, 10:44:39 AM] Gary Teh: After running this initial end to end process manually to get a sense of what works and what not, I spent sometime today to slightly scale up our TikTok influencer outreach process by creating this web scraping recipe on GetData.IO

https://getdata.io/data-sources/129694-tiktok-influencer-profile-page-email-address-scraping-

Given a list of shortlisted TikTok influencer profiles URL, the crawler visits each page and then extracts the email address listed on each influencer’s profile page.

We then feed it to our automated email outreach tool.

Was able to gather more than 100 email addresses within a span of 1 hour using the data gathering infrastructure ‎<This message was edited>

It does not make sense to allow random cross promotion of projects in our DAO channels

A close analogy is a TikTok employee going into Facebook office in Menlo Park, California and then pasting posters about TikTok products on the walls of Facebook office 

A security guard working for Facebook overseeing the premise will end up recognizing the out of place posters as such (_vandalism_) and then removing them

During the meet up session people are fed and also learn how to make chocolate for free ‎<This message was edited>

[4/3/24, 9:52:13 AM] Gary Teh: Marketing 4Ps Building off of the chocolate making meetups idea

*Product packaging*
- chocolate making meetups (_product is no longer the cacao but the entire experience_)

*Target audience*
- mum wanting to learn how to make healthy snacks for kids
- ⁠couples on a date 
- ⁠families wanting family time with kids 
- ⁠corporate events for team building purposes

*Promotions*
- Viator.com / TripAdvisor 
- ⁠distributing fliers at backpackers hostels 
- ⁠meetup.com announcements 

*Venue*
- parks

[4/14/24, 7:43:49 PM] Gary Teh: Had this chat @918017107841 this morning regarding the pursuit of market opportunities business development wise

DAO has eyes and ears over the place, spread across six continents to be exact. It’s a really wide net which ends up picking up a lot of opportunities. More opportunities than DAO has resources to pursue

At this point, it makes sense to follow the GE rule

Unless DAO has an unfair advantage that other players in the market niche don’t, and DAO can see a path to end up either the leader or close second in the market niche associated with a market opportunity, we will not deploy our resources to pursue the opportunity

This should further help us focus on where resources should be deployed

This also mean, we will end up saying no to around 99% of the opportunities that come our way ‎<This message was edited>

[4/18/24, 5:07:14 PM] Gary Teh: *Thoughts regarding @120363044028036610@g.us*

_Current value that we need to offer our customers (people who buy from us)_

- underwriting the risk of renegade suppliers

- ⁠verifying suppliers are legitimate and not scammers 

- providing the financing to bring in the shipment 

_Another critical value that we need to offer our customers_

- proper hedging so that our customers do not experience wild price fluctuations and supply shortage which is becoming increasingly critical during this unpredictable phase of climate change

_PS: the farmers are not our customers. While the core purpose of the @120363044028036610@g.us project is to help them help restore our rainforest, at the end of the day, they are still suppliers_ ‎<This message was edited>

we are aligned with the vision of the project. whatever we are going to do out here in the desert is basically R&D for what we will deploy when we colonize the surface of the moon. 

Based on the ongoing conversations he’s been having with the NASA and SpaceX engineers based here in Silicon Valley, we are 5 to 10 years away from moon surface colonization

Decentralized infrastructure is going to be a key aspect of this ecosystem we are building since we should be expecting more and more far-flung colonies in outer space

- he is keen to chip in USD1000-2000 play money on the next inbound shipment of @120363044028036610@g.us cacao nibs. He is very intrigued that we have been able to break into supply chain which has been historically a very opaque industry and making it transparent by using blockchain  

- ⁠he will setup a minimal viable @120363045796860099@g.us offgrid power facility at his place in Santa Cruz. I just need to ship over a bitcoin miner to run our proof of concept to test the entire end to end before we go for V1 in slab city this coming winter

Met Willow, a shaman who was leading the cacao activation this evening. She ended up buying a pound of cacao. She got really excited when she realized I had with me a new strain of cacao she never had before. 

She also suggested that she needs my help to certify the Ecuador farm that she is currently bringing in cacao from because the import and sales is technically illegal. 

She is a traveling healer diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and only has two and a half years of lifespan left  

*_Recurring patterns observed*_

- healers who specialize in pain management 

- ⁠uses cacao as a gift

- ⁠curious to try more varieties of cacao  

- ⁠female in late forties and early fifties 

- ⁠attends ecstatic dance 

- ⁠there is always an altar at these ecstatic dance sessions dedicated to *_Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva*_ who expounded the *_Heart Sutra*_

- ⁠there seem to be a cultural convergence between the *_Heart Sutra*_ and *_Cacao, medicine of the Heart*_ or some call it Heart resonance

[5/13/24, 6:49:42 AM] Gary Teh: Spent two hours yesterday catching up with Sarah here in Portland, Oregon and to discuss the following

- on the use of our cacao to mix with magic mushroom she is using for therapy 

- ⁠she has reached out to her shaman contacts here on our ceremonial grade cacao

PS: she is a state certified therapist for magic mushrooms also she is right now helping setup the Portland branch for the church of the Sacred growth which is based out of Oakland ‎<This message was edited>
[5/13/24, 4:14:05 PM] Gary Teh: @17755088150 has helped sold off two bags of ceremonial grade Cacao to shamans here in Portland. I will pop by and drop them off to her and then pass through again.

🙂🙏

[5/13/24, 8:32:27 PM] Gary Teh: In case anyone is wondering how medicinal mushroom laced chocolate bar is made 

This was how I did it yesterday when spending the evening with the Bus Kings over at their place in East Oregon

[5/13/24, 8:39:24 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the bus kings will be touring Oregon this summer and autumn 

Daniel spent bulk of the evening explaining how the eeed growing business he used to run works as well as the local market dynamics for psilocybin mushrooms in Oregon 

https://youtu.be/OB-wxZdlJxU?si=blGq6atWeT4ZnmwH

Even thought weed is officially legalized, weed from the legal channels are of poorer quality and more expensive. Legal distributors need to pay government their taxes and end up needing to cut back on quality 

Meanwhile weed off the black market is of way higher quality but at 50% the price since no taxes were paid to the government and more money could be deployed to generate higher quality output 

_PS: Black Market price for psilocybin mushroom in Portland Oregon is USD2.50 per gram compared to USD10 per gram out there in the Arizona desert 🤯_
[5/14/24, 1:41:16 PM] Gary Teh: In case you’re wondering how crazy the journey into the rainforest visit to Cacao farms are, this is one of those crazy ones

I fell off the motorbike on this one when we were going down a steep slope coming out the farm

[5/22/24, 5:47:06 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: if you’re in the desert I am sure your car isn’t scanned at all
[5/22/24, 5:48:06 AM] Janet: Not at all unless they are without notice specifically higher newer models. US have lots of security
[5/22/24, 5:48:19 AM] Janet: 😐
[5/22/24, 5:49:16 AM] Alessandro Mele: Can someone figure out how to find his phone ? He’s got an iPhone and maybe we can use the “find my phone” tool??
[5/22/24, 5:49:19 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: we are only scanned if we are speeding, so lucky to have a scan at all. I think this scan doesn’t say he has not been driving or moving after
[5/22/24, 5:50:12 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: only if he is sharing this data with you. find a friend or so
[5/22/24, 5:51:32 AM] Janet: Contact Sarah

[5/22/24, 10:17:29 AM] Garis Pang: I am guessing maybe his car broken down in the middle of nowhere and it’s hard to seek help from where he was.
[5/22/24, 10:18:17 AM] Bhavana: I'm not in the USA currently
[5/22/24, 10:18:25 AM] Val Lapidus: @17755088150 can you check with this person you are talking to about what would happen if someone’s car broke down near there?  is there a way to get service?

[5/22/24, 10:26:56 AM] Sarah H.: Yes
[5/22/24, 10:28:56 AM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Sarah. 

I was going to fly down next week to Tacoma to trace where Gary is last spotted, so this is helpful 

Just that we cannot be sure if the person she (Marcia) met is Indeed Gary
[5/22/24, 10:29:16 AM] Salim AL-Bitar: I guess now is a good time to contact the festival organizers
[5/22/24, 10:29:37 AM] Sarah H.: @Aga sent the arganizers an email

[5/22/24, 10:32:42 AM] Val Lapidus: any one know his date of birth
[5/22/24, 10:32:44 AM] Sarah H.: Fine
[5/22/24, 10:33:01 AM] Sarah H.: He is at the clean up crew
[5/22/24, 10:34:06 AM] Val Lapidus: how do we know he is with cleanup crew?
[5/22/24, 10:34:19 AM] Johnson Teh: Thanks Sarah, so Gary is still at the Festival now? Since 19 May (Sunday?)
[5/22/24, 10:34:33 AM] Sarah H.: That’s what the Facebook group is saying
‎[5/22/24, 10:34:57 AM] Sarah H.: ‎image omitted
[5/22/24, 10:37:04 AM] Johnson Teh: Ok thanks Sarah,

So Gary is cleaning up with the clean up crew at the festival site now? And site has no signal?
[5/22/24, 10:38:37 AM] Sarah H.: That’s what members of the Facebook group are saying
[5/22/24, 10:38:39 AM] Garis Pang: Strange? If they can exchange texts on FB and Gary’s mobile got no Wifi to be connected? ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 10:39:00 AM] Sarah H.: They are all back from the event - I posted pics of the comments
[5/22/24, 10:39:19 AM] Johnson Teh: Whoever is in touch with the organiser please ask them for update on the event and keep us posted 

Rest will wait for more update

[5/22/24, 10:47:43 AM] Iwona Fluda: As long as he is not writing here and police still has him on the list of missing people, we shall continue with the search, I believe. What do you think?
[5/22/24, 10:55:48 AM] Garis Pang: I guess you are right, I am thinking alike too.
[5/22/24, 10:57:14 AM] Barbara Sandini: Okay so is this true? He is alive and well?
[5/22/24, 10:58:11 AM] Garis Pang: Firstly, who is the TS of this Reddit post?
[5/22/24, 10:58:36 AM] Iwona Fluda: I mean you can basically see anything these days on the internet - a place full of made up stories. ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 11:02:34 AM] Garis Pang: If Gary can’t be contacted either ways since he left the fair after the cleaning up, means he is officially a missing person, which is more than a week by now. What do you think?
[5/22/24, 11:03:12 AM] Iwona Fluda: Totally, this is why we shall keep on searching.
[5/22/24, 11:04:00 AM] Val Lapidus: I think based on feedback from people at the festival where he was, he was part of the cleanup crew who was meant to leave to day
[5/22/24, 11:04:07 AM] Val Lapidus: so I’m pausing searching
[5/22/24, 11:04:45 AM] Garis Pang: In fact, we are all worrying and working in each own limited ways to search for him to come in contact again.
[5/22/24, 11:09:59 AM] Garis Pang: Can you confirm this that he is very ok?
[5/22/24, 11:22:23 AM] Janet: Wen was the festival dates. Is it still ongoing and how long does clean up crew takes. Best bet to contact cleaning crew management
[5/22/24, 11:22:55 AM] Janet: Today

[5/22/24, 11:37:56 AM] Johnson Teh: Hi, for all these whom have access to the festival organiser and attendee via FB
 
just to be sure….

(1) festival site has no network 
(2) It ended on 20 May (Sun) and 
(3) Gary has stayed behind with the clean up crew to help with the cleaning up…

So Gary might pop up anytime once he has network?? 

If so lets pray and keep all posted.
Thanks

[5/22/24, 1:23:09 PM] Alessandro Mele: You have the police and the FBI looking for you all over the country !!!
[5/22/24, 1:23:15 PM] Iwona Fluda: Can someone explain to Gary how much we missed him?

[5/22/24, 1:40:14 PM] Gary Teh: Oh..  sorry

I didn’t realize they had totally zero Internet there until I finally parked and started helping setup the fair as a volunteer 🤦‍♂️

But seems like I have been invited to a whole bunch of other festivals like these in the pacific north west for the rest of the season 

Great place to promote our cacao 

People loved it for the following reasons 

- the taste from the way the medicine of the heart was prepared was spectacular 

- ⁠the story of being able to perform a simple act to help restore our rainforest was absolutely empowering to these folks most of whom have never stepped outside of the country before 

- ⁠the price point was a no brainer 

We have a winning product. We just need to monitor customer retention to see if this acquisition method via festivals can scale 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[5/22/24, 1:41:02 PM] Ken Nim - Bay Area : yay, AI Cacao Gary showed up. Glad you’re okay
[5/22/24, 1:43:21 PM] Johnson Teh: Px point didn't priced in your missing and the energy it took us to locate

But pretty amazing to know how resourceful this CG can be.

Thanks all for their great effort
[5/22/24, 1:43:23 PM] Janet: Retention … and I thought South Americans were involved. Or who knows who …
[5/22/24, 1:52:51 PM] Suheil - Europe: guys guys what was Mister @14153000019 calling this type of incident “ the switch” or something like that totally believing that without him the community would never engage?

then I guess…I can proudly say… in your face @14153000019 … even without you we were able to engage on a most efficient level that we were able to retrieve you before even you got the time to get back online and reply here ;)
[5/22/24, 1:57:30 PM] Iwona Fluda: How exciting! 😂🙃 Please just give someone a list of the places before disappearing again. At some point, even FBI will give up on you 😜
[5/22/24, 1:58:16 PM] Iwona Fluda: The Poles, they are always dangerous 😂
[5/22/24, 2:38:23 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: If we say in Swiss German someone is im Cacao, it means at the end of the world or even in a mess. Well glad, you’re back 😜
[5/22/24, 3:27:33 PM] Gary Teh: The folks at the fair started at emulating the sound of crows after listening to the name *_cacao*_ being mentioned a few times

I think that’s has somewhat became the tagline 🤔
[5/22/24, 3:32:34 PM] Tiff Tiff: @14153000019 - I hope you are feeling great knowing that you are loved, you are noticed and witnessed and that if you are in trouble people all over the globe will be coming to find you ❤️

[5/22/24, 10:59:41 PM] Gary Teh: I was invited to come back for the okanogan barter faire in fall during the last week of October 

There is usually 4X more people in that one versus the one in spring which was what I just attended. 

My assumption is that the bales of hay will end up 4X higher in fall… 

Go figure 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

The local honey mead (_wine_) producer came up and requested for my contact details

He is seeking chocolate to lace his honey mead with 

There doesn’t seem to be any local chocolatier

The closest chocolatier he can visit is in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon 

As a source he feels it’s very important to be able to taste test it before placing an order of shipment

PS: _*the consumer customer sales activity organically yielding enterprise customer pattern*_ that was exhibited in my parents’ food distribution business back in Singapore is starting to manifest in this project too. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/27/24, 11:32:52 PM] Gary Teh: As adviced by Peter Thiel (_paypal cofounder_), gain a large share of a small market and then scaling strategically.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7ewO1IyZun/?igsh=MXNjdWNqM2sxaHM4ag== 

Competition has been non-existent and if they did exist, our offering is sufficiently differentiated at these small scale regional barter faires up here in the Pacific Northwest. 

From my perspective, it is strategic to fully saturate this distribution and establish a firm foothold before we start expanding to the next distribution channels.

Part of this process will be identifying and recruiting the lieutenants to secure and continue operating these areas before I shift my attention to the next adjacent distribution channel

This is where having an Multilevel marketing model in place comes in handy ‎<This message was edited>

[5/28/24, 1:39:25 PM] Gary Teh: There seems to be a tribune of elders amongst the nomad community that regularly communicate amongst themselves where they collectively maintain a black list of people that should be kept out of the network. 

The reverse seem to be also the case where elders in the community will take notice of an outsider when an elder vouches for him or her. These unnamed elders will at their own time and pace come interact with the outsider and come to their own judgement.

As more and more elders in the network vouch for this outsider, he/she gains status/reputation within the network. The by-product is invitation to access network facilities that are not usually accessible to outsiders.

[5/31/24, 6:23:05 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the best way to rapidly gain reputation and support within the nomadic network in the Pacific Northwest is to bring a ton of food to each campfire I visit and then cook and serve it

our hunter gathering forefathers had to hunt to acquire food while our modern day humans have to work a 9-5 to acquire food. 

The most efficient hack I have discovered so far is to go hunter gathering at local food banks for weeks worth of supplies and then unloaded them at every camp I visit. 

This is my most recent hunter gathering hack if anyone is curious🤩🙏

[6/1/24, 12:00:29 AM] Gary Teh: These past few weeks while sitting around doing nothing offline, I have been mulling this one question.

The question was posed to me by a fellow hacker at the HackerDojo down in Mountain View, Silicon Valley last year. while me and @16468233438 were serving out samples of our cacao drink

*_How do you measure biodiversity in an ecosystem and ensure that the cabruca system actually helps with biodiversity?*_

A few months ago I did manage to find a lot of mathematical formulas to measure biodiversity in an ecosystem. The most common one is the *_Shannon diversity index*_.

https://www.statology.org/shannon-diversity-index/ 

The math is easy, the main challenge lies in gathering the data and compiling the biodiversity index of a farm. 

Farmers are busy. And it’s comes across as additional work for what would be considered marketing purposes from their perspective

Working through the statistics and thinking through the available technology that is out there, seems the least effortful way to implement the measurement of this would be to use a drone mounted with a high resolution camera 

The video from the drone would be piped to an AI model that then identifies and quantifies all the different species of plants and animals surfaced in the video stream

And if we flew the drone in a fixed pattern across the farm from _east to west, north to south_ we should end up with a 80% accurate count of the different species in the environment 

If this same methodology is applied on all the farms we survey, we will end up with a good enough tabulation overtime. 

We can then justify why we decided to support one farm and not another farm.

And each farm in our support network will come associated with a Shannon index 

And people who buy our bags of cacao nibs could then scan the associated QR code and very quickly see the statistics of the farm the cacao is from. 

If we want ensure the records against being tempered, we could write the records on the blockchain signed with our key

That is how I would see AI and blockchain being implemented at the farm level ‎<This message was edited>

*_Outcomes*_
- granted access to use the San Francisco state university innovation labs facility whenever I am in town 

*_Next steps*_

- draft up the scope for inspiration leadership program which he will then surface to the professors for discussion 

- ⁠expected outcome is we will mentor selected students to build out specific aspects of @120363044028036610@g.us and TrueSight DAO

- ⁠scope 1: implementation of Shannon Biodiversity index via smart contracts on the blockchain for farms

- ⁠scope 2: extension of smart contract records by freighting companies and community warehouse managers

- ⁠scope 3: extend smart contracts for ratification by independent third party (_universities, churches, government_)

- ⁠scope 4: for voluntary contributions done by community members to move DAO project forward, mint them as as ledger entry in the blockchain in exchange for governance tokens

- ⁠will review what Stanley’s team has built so far to see what we could use for scope 1 through 4 the week after

_PS: seems the act of brewing cacao *nomad style* at the parking lot outside of the Ciel building last Friday for our summit has welcomed unexpected second order effect 🤩🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>

[6/11/24, 2:59:11 PM] Gary Teh: We are down to approximately 9.5kg and 20 bags of 8 ounce cacao nibs for AGL2 (_need to spend sometime to update ledger to reflect sales activities from last friday_)

Once the entire shipment is cleared investors in AGL2 will be expecting their payout as per terms stipulated in the clauses therein

We will be holding another cacao circle this coming Thursday evening at Block71 at the National University of Singapore alumni event organized by @6598622082 and Angeline ‎<This message was edited>
[6/11/24, 3:10:27 PM] Gary Teh: _*Goal of ongoing AGL2 contract*_

- validate that we could import 100KG, figure out the logistics via airfreight and clear USA border customs with no issues
- ⁠validate we can identify repeatable sales channels where we could distribute our cacao nibs
- ⁠validate that end consumers resonate with our brand story

_Outcome_
- We were successful on all 3 counts



*_Goal of AGL3 contract_*

- validate that we could import 500KG, figure out the logistics via sea freight and clear customs with no issues

- ⁠⁠validate we can scale existing repeatable sales channels and identify more sales channels where we could distribute all 500kg of our cacao nibs successfully

- determine the maximum volume of cacao nibs that could be absorbed via vanlife-like/nomadic activities in the Pacific North west during Spring, Summer and Autumn period as well as in the desert region during the Winter season.

- ⁠determine that we are able to sell successfully to chocolatiers via Cold marketing outreach.

- ⁠determine that there is indeed demand for 100% cacao ceremonial bars

- ⁠figure out logistics for canning and selling chocolate drinks for sales
[6/11/24, 3:40:15 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes with Natalie from the women’s cooperative in the state of Para (_which is even deeper in the Amazon rainforest_) to make arrangements to visit the cooperative and the farms in that cluster. I will be visiting the state of Para after visiting the state of Bahia where Ilheus is.

[6/12/24, 12:35:00 AM] Gary Teh: At the rate the viral loop pattern is playing out, we might end up establishing ties with farming corporatives in all states along the Amazon river sooner rather than later on the Brazilian side 

Though population level within our DAO is still low by the standards of social networks, the Network effects has gained critical mass within the cacao industry vertical. 

_PS: A good parallel is Facebook in its early days. Although total number of users on Facebook was very small at just a few hundred, population penetration within Harvard University had crossed threshold to achieve critical mass level on campus._

[6/12/24, 1:22:01 PM] Gary Teh: Finished preparing contract for upcoming  @120363044028036610@g.us AGL3 

Made a bunch of enhancements to the clauses therein based on learnings from AGL2 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdFtZ8YoGMsE0RdQ4hGFINUO8CORap7smzbmQXy4Dj4/edit

Also, DAO will be charging fees of 22% instead of 19% for helping manage the sales and marketing of the inbound shipment 

This increase is justified by the fact that during AGL2, DAO has figured out a repeatable sales and marketing channel 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdFtZ8YoGMsE0RdQ4hGFINUO8CORap7smzbmQXy4Dj4/edit

_PS: my sense is as distribution channel scales and sales volume continues to increase to the level where we can absorb more and more of the production capacity of the regenerative farms we are serving, investment return multiples for AGL contract investors will gradually tend towards multi of the federal reserve risk free interest rate yield._

_Junk bonds (unsecured loans) and MREITs (mortgage backed real estate investment trust) in USA are returning around 12% per annum at the moment._

_While the US federal reserve overnight interest rate sitting around 5% right now_ ‎<This message was edited>

The chocolate manufacturing industry is going through this news cycle of extremely bad PR at the moment

Not sure how long it’s going to last but feels like we caught this wave at just the right time and we are coasting along at the moment.

He mentioned his already working with quite a few procurement managers working for manufacturers

The proposed next step is for him to talk to the procurement managers to get a tabulated list of the kind of materials they are looking for 

We are on our side will handle the FDA clearance of all materials to feed into his system inventory as well as compliance off suppliers while he on his side will just focus on acquiring procurement managers for his inventory system

- ⁠ corresponding with Alice on buyer feedback from ShenZhen china
[6/18/24, 12:12:14 PM] Gary Teh: *_Reflections on the qualitative data received so far*_

*_Manufacturers*_ that utilize our raw material for their own final product, really only care about availability of supplies and price. if we go down this route, we will just end up haggling over price and margins with the buyer and the farmers. It will only further compound the inertia in the industry that is right now causing all these social and environmental problems, the source of all this negative PR in the industry right now.


When that the price of the end product matches with existing brands out there, *_USA Consumers*_ are very sensitive to the narrative/brand story. And will be very inclined to switch. All thanks to the 2020 pandemic and the increasing concerns about climate change... every new report of nature disasters that are attributed to climate change only serves to galvanize more support for the @120363044028036610@g.us brand story 

In light of this key piece of insight, the Tesla approach of owning the entire supply Chain vertical till the stage of consumer sales, bypassing, all traditional middle men, makes a lot of sense. ‎<This message was edited>

[6/19/24, 7:09:45 AM] Gary Teh: Finally got around to thinking through why TDG tokens would be interesting for *_professional investors/speculators*_ now that our governance tokens are on the way to getting listed on LATOKENS exchange 

*_Simple high level calculation based on just @120363044028036610@g.us business model*_

- Estimated market size of 1% of the US chocolate market: $195 million

- Estimated market capitalization of the future company at 1% market penetration level (using an average P/S ratio of 2): $390 million

- Current valuation of DAO (based on total tokens issued at 1 TDG = 1 USD): $1.9 million

- Expected return on capital returns at 1% market penetration: *_205x*_ ($390 million ÷ $1.9 million = 205)

_Spent around 30 minutes working through the mathematics and the high level projections with the aid of chatgpt in pulling out and tabulating the numbers._

_Did not include high level projections for other geographical territories that we could expand into or products other than cacao derivatives_

_To get to target 1% market penetration, we need to source for a few more talents, namely_

- seasoned FMCG marketeer

- ⁠seasoned international logistics and freighting professional

Will leave it to the traders on the LATOKENs exchange to decide how they want to price the tokens, namely the following approach 

- cash per token

- ⁠contribution per token

- ⁠some multiple of our historic revenue 

- ⁠some speculative value based on what has been realized so far by our execution using their own Growth model projections

[6/19/24, 7:51:57 AM] Gary Teh: Based on governance tokens management protocol voted into effect 15th Nov 2023 in our TownHall

- Rule 3: if trading price falls below cash per token, DAO will proceed to do buy back

- Rule 4: If trading price goes above USDT1, DAO will proceed to make sale till the maximum extend of increasing total TDG tokens in circulation by additional 25% of what was already in circulation at the end of the previous quarter.

And it will be at 50% the cost of what we incurred packaging it in the US 

Next steps will be to talk for the Kraft pouch supplier in São Paulo that @554792591729 has sourced for

Have to supply create the pouches, using @972543523823s new design and shipping them to until this Orlantildes office in itabuna

_PS: hopefully we can get the shipment in by early September so that we are in time for the festivities happening during autumn season in the Pacific Northwest and winter season in the Arizona and California high Desert of USA_ ‎<This message was edited>

- @557391090002 has the closest proximity to where the cacaos are farmed as well as the culture around it

- Bruno is an international award winning chef he is the best person to make video recordings of himself coming up with recipes for our cacao nibs

Once we have identified all the edge cases that will cause the process to fail then start implementing smart contract to handle the payment in the background

That is where transactions will be tied to the bank account I right now setting up in Brazil as well as the bank account we have in the USA

@14806488258 did suggest experimenting with international mailing of small packages when we last had lunch a few months ago.

[6/27/24, 11:53:28 PM] Gary Teh: And then it occurred to me the Kraft pouch might be the perfect envelope to ship the chocolates in 🤩

- exterior is tough enough to withstand wear and tear

- ⁠it is possible to easily write or simply stick an address label on it

- ⁠interior is water proof  and airtight when heat sealed so not a big issue even if the chocolate melts

- ⁠the aluminum lining also provides some structural reinforcement to prevent the interior content from being too damaged

[6/28/24, 8:04:00 PM] Gary Teh: Spent four hours wining and dining over at Paulo’s family house with his dad who is a senior official of CEPLAC 

- The key takeaways are the total production volume of Organic cacao is 1200 tons a year

- ⁠ only 10% of these supplies are properly fermented with at least 80% fermentation level

- ⁠ the fermentation of the other 90% of the supplies is inconsistent  hence lots of them are just sold bulk price 

- ⁠ he proposed to set up a separate fermentation facility to handle fermentation to increase the total supply of well to be above 10% of the organic cacao supply by 3X

- ⁠ makes total sense why the markup for organic cacao versus bulk price in this region is around 20% as opposed to 100%

- ⁠ totally explains why Natalia emphasized this during our conversation two weeks ago

- ⁠ also explains why the directors of the corporative yesterday was asking how many percent fermentation in the cacao we are seeking in our sourcing

- ⁠ finally explains the anomaly in the Organico pricing that I observed when @554792591729 first surfaced the pricing from this region to me earlier this year

- ⁠ my response to him at the zero to one stage. We just want to make sure the Supply Chain works. We are just going to test a small shipment.

- ⁠ in later iterations, we will start optimizing the supply chain as what we are doing right now in Bahia ‎<This message was edited>

[6/28/24, 10:37:29 PM] Vibhu Mittal: There’s a “e-packet shipping” clause in the UPU that was designed to help Ecommerce between China and the rest of the world. It has since been expanded to a lot of other countries. The solution might be to find some country nearby that has the UPU epacket agreement with the US, bulk ship cacao to that country, and then take advantage of shipping rates from that country to the US. 

Or bulk ship cacao to the US and then do retail shipping to customers from a US address using bulk mail shipping rates.

[6/29/24, 3:09:09 AM] Gary Teh: Insights from last evening

starting to understand why I couldn’t find any cooperatives in the Amazonas state that grows organic cacao

They don’t grow it there , the indigenous just goes into the jungle to harvest the wild Cacao that’s growing there

The center of activity is the town of Tabathinga which I traversed through last year during my border crossing from Brazil into Columbia

[6/29/24, 6:49:44 PM] Gary Teh: One of those days where I had to absolutely back track on my statement

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C80lzSstCMX/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Last year, when I was just starting to dabble into this space, I mentioned to folks around me that the Cacao don’t really taste different from one region to another

At Cacao Innovation Center I was offered samples of three different chocolate made using the same exact recipe… 70% cacao

They tasted absolutely different  🤯
[6/30/24, 9:21:52 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the Sunday*

- The final three hours yesterday evening was the most critical qualitative observation during this entire week since arriving in Altamira.

- Jedie pulled over on the highway while on our way back to Altamira when he saw a fellow organizer of the event had a flat tire. It was in the middle of nowhere where there was zero cell phone reception.

- He first tried to help change the tire using his own tools but quickly realize the nuts were a different size.

- He drove for 20 minutes to the nearby farm attempting to get help but realized the farm was closed.

- He drove for 30 minutes to a nearby restaurant attempting to get help.

- He managed to finally arrange for help to come.

- He drove back to the organizer’s truck to explain the help he has setup

- He brought loaded passenger on the other truck over to our truck to bring the passenger back to Altamira while help came

*Constrains he experienced during the entire situation*

- It’s been a long day, we were all physically tired especially since he went to bed pretty late the night before as well

- ⁠the sun has set. Road conditions were bad and it was pouring heavily

- ⁠The gear box of our truck was already on the verge of failing. He was praying for the gear box to continue holding before our drive back to Altamira

*Personal interpretation*

- If Jedie had a weaker character he could have just ignored the fellow participant who was experiencing trouble and continued going about his business.

- I always believe you can’t change a person’s character, but instead you could do is to be very diligent when selecting professional partners based on desirable character trait that they already exhibit when undertaking minor things.

- ⁠My interpretation from this, when issued a request, Jedie will to the utmost of his abilities deliver on the requirements. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/1/24, 6:51:05 AM] Gary Teh: Experimented with sending out a 200g net weight of cacao almonds

Total weight of package was 332grams

Total cost, including package material was $37.89

_PS: the payload was more than two times heavier Cost of shipping ended up being cheaper 🤯🤔_

_I wonder what happens if I attempt to ship a one KG of Cacao almond from here as the next experiment 🤔_

[7/2/24, 5:22:10 PM] Gary Teh: Obtained this sample of cacao almonds after visiting two farms here in the state of para to bring back to California 

It has a flavour profile that is very distinct from the one we have from Bahia

While the one from Bahia is very well balanced and aromatic 

This one is very floral and fruity. It is perfect for the cacao almond snacks

It’s grown on former pasture (_deforested_) land that has since been restored by the family living on it ‎<This message was edited>

[7/2/24, 6:19:17 PM] Gary Teh: Similar with Bahia, the earliest time they can start shipping will be in August. The impact of climate change is deeply felt across the board. 

Till now their warehouse is mostly empty and devoid of inventory, even though it is usually the case that harvest generally starts in May and inventory becomes available late May.
[7/2/24, 7:32:11 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 2 hours thinking through the qualitative data collected from the folks in the Bahia and Para community

the prevailing norm is for dominant chocolate manufacturers (_majority European based_) to import cacao from these communities, perform the manufacturing in Europe before redistributing the end products to the consumers, in the process capturing the bulk of the profit margin for themselves.

Analysis with the help of Meta AI shows that USA is in fact the world’s largest market for chocolate consumption. 

Shifting manufacturing away from Europe to the source countries and then importing the manufactured end product directly into USA if done properly will yield structural cost savings that will be hard for European manufacturers to compete against in the USA market (_we don’t incur logistic cost associated with having a European leg in our supply chain_). 

From my limited understanding, since there is a lot of labor union protection in these European, shifting their manufacturing to source countries for these companies is like pulling teeth. It will also generate very very bad PR for them domestically. But since we have zero legacy, we dont have this problem.

From this perspective, the *disruptive innovation/ differentiation is the structure of the supply chain itself*

- Importing directly into the USA, _the world's largest market_, from source countries
- Direct sourcing from small scale farming to support regenerative farming practices in the Amazon rainforest
- ⁠Stimulating local industry growth to eventually displace the dominant chocolate manufacturers
- Reducing carbon footprint by eliminating the European leg of the supply chain
- offer USA consumers high quality cacao as opposed to low quality cacao at the same prevailing price

The *final outcome*
- Environment: reduced carbon footprint and support for regenerative farming
- Consumers: high-quality cacao at a competitive price
- Local communities: economic growth and empowerment ‎<This message was edited>

[7/5/24, 9:40:38 AM] Gary Teh: _PS: Barking up the wrong tree by hoping to get resource challenged farmers to pay for technology solutions was a lesson I learned when working on platform growth and monetization back in Edmodo_

_Teachers in the USA are the most abused lot in the country. When I was making initial visits to classroom in the USA while conducting interviews and making actual on the ground observations, first thing I noticed is that they are really really broke and always under-resourced. And often left very streased_ 

_USA public schools are underfunded. Meanwhile parents having paid a lot of money to moving to expensive for real estate within reputable school district expect schools to handle the rest when it comes to their children’s education without forking out more resources on their end_

_it’s a vicious catch 22 making education a very challenging vertical_

_in hindsight, it was really good training Dojo as a technologist since you are trained from day one to know how to deliver quality that work with limited resources… aka being very *LEAN*._

_this operating philosophy helps one go a very long way in any industrial vertical one attempts to penetrate especially in the pre-product-market-fit stages_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/7/24, 6:28:40 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 spent 10 hours researching the strategy of the other chocolate companies and proposed two go to market strategies for testing 

- current go to market strategy is still too spotty and lack enough consistency to scale 

- shadowing/replication the distribution network of specific health food store that is in close proximity to the yoga studios/gym that was observed in Palo Alto 

- ⁠focus on smaller regional retail networks that are focused on our target audience segment. Example ranch99 established their network in areas with a high concentration of Chinese. We need to find similar distributors that are focused on wellness enthusiasts… something like the retail distributor chain that the Tanto (_kitchen head of department in the zen monastery_) suggested ‎<This message was edited>

- state to consumer on package that each N KG of chocolate sold, 1 cacao tree is planted on pasture land in the Amazon that is to be restored

It states if a piece of land has 80% of forestation or less, no trees can be cut down. 

If a land has more than 80% forestation up to 20% of the land could be cleared 

For legacy land that has below 80% Forestation, if the land was left fallow and New trees start to grow on it, land owners by law are not allowed to cut down any of the trees Forestation level is above 80%

*_Agenda*_
- gather intelligence on what the major trends are 

- ⁠see where the bigger brands are going with their product offerings and then do the opposite to avoid getting steam rolled from a product differentiation standpoint point 

- ⁠get to know more cacao derivative factory operators 

- ⁠get to know more chefs who work to produce cacao derivatives 

- ⁠get to know what the latest RnD in terms of cacao derivatives
[7/8/24, 4:59:06 AM] Dr. Denis: I've heard they are adding microplastics in diary products in China but I could never imagine that it works also with coconuts directly on the ground in Brazil.

- custom duty exemption 
- ⁠cheap incorporation cost and year renewal fees
- ⁠liberal legislation on cryptocurrencies

Belize remains the best country incorporate the parent DAO entity that manages the governance tokens still sitting in the vault 

Coincidentally, Dimitra.io the recent company I research also had their company incorporated there 

Next step would be to experiment with shipping a bar of chocolate from Belize to San Francisco to get data on the actual cost of shipping

And then ship a bar of chocolate from Brazil to an address to Belize

That way we can then compare the actual price difference 🤔

Bulk shipping will be tricky to consider at this early stage since sales volume is not that high yet

[7/10/24, 11:10:50 AM] Gary Teh: Part of the agenda of today’s meeting with Karen is to get some visibility of how much carbon credit we will get issued if we financed 100 trees to the indigenous in the Amazonas that @557191035605 introduced

Ideally, the realized sale price of the carbon credit we get for financing the 100 Cacao trees to the indigenous in the Amazonas is more than the actual amount of USD spent acquiring the cacao trees

That way DAO will still have a net surplus after the 100 cacao tree has been financed and shipped to the indigenous folks there

_PS: there is a difference between sustainable sustainability efforts (the funds replenishes itself) and unsustainable philanthropy (giving money away)_ ‎<This message was edited>
[7/10/24, 12:38:44 PM] Gary Teh: Completed 40 minutes face time with Karen

*Follow ups*
- Karent to determine if the economics might work for her company to help issue carbon credits in exchange for TDG governance tokens
- ⁠Karen to determine if it is possible to issue at least USD$5 worth of carbon credit per tree planted
- ⁠Karen to define the exact methodology we must follow to get the carbon credit issued for the trees we finance to the indigenous

Target outcome
- $USD500 worth of carbon credit issued for the 100 Cacao trees we will be fiinancing to be planted by the indigenous that @557191035605 introduced.

[7/10/24, 12:43:03 PM] Gary Teh: Scope 2 in the San Francisco state university key stone projects which I will be discussing with Stanley Li this evening will be very interesting

This came up during my discussion with Karen

Basically the measuring of an area’s biodiversity using Drones via the Shannon index methodology

[7/10/24, 1:32:06 PM] Gary Teh: *The underlying cacao plantation economics*

- cost per treeling: $3
- ⁠number of trees possible per hectare: 1000
- minimum annual cacao yield per tree: 1kg 
- ⁠cost per kg of organic cacao: $20
- ⁠average hectare manageable by 1 person: 3 hectares 

Time spent for analysis 30 minutes
[7/10/24, 2:32:10 PM] Gary Teh: Understood from the conversation with Karen there are a few carbon credit registries that we can interface with to get the carbon credit issued 

Each registry has its own Methodology we must follow and set of documentation to get the carbon credit issued 

_PS. Starting to see the some pattern similarities between carbon credit registries and the web servers_

_all of the latter serve web pages but their architecture and interfacing is a little different_

_the main commonality is that HTML documents are served when http requests are received_

_The Apache web server has a different expectation versus the Microsoft IIS server versus the rails engine versus the Python Django engine_ ‎<This message was edited>

[7/10/24, 5:24:08 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 1.5 hours facetime with Stanley Li and Mayra

Mayra is one of the student union leaders from the San Francisco state university

*Key takeaways*

- Mayra will bring scope 1 back to the student union and work on organizing an on-campus event as an initial pilot to drive awareness of the current problem into chocolate industry 

- ⁠KPI proposed for adoption by Stanley for event success - 1) Number of new Instagram content supporters and 2) sales volume on agroverse.shop

- ⁠Mayra will look through some of the engineering scope and reach out to students in the engineering faculty to find students who open to contribution

- ⁠Mayra will be working with the student union to help source for government funding to implement the proposed scope.

_PS: Mayra is from Peru. She and her parents are familiar with the issues in the cacao industry._

[7/12/24, 11:43:35 AM] Gary Teh: Bumped into Eddy Diamantis, a FullBright scholar, undergoing internship for a U.S. law firm. He is undertaking an assignment for their firm on behalf of some USA govnerment. The goal is to figure out how to further increase USA foreign direct investment as well as near shoring in this region 

*_My interpretation*_

- USA barely has any foreign investment interest in Brazil 

- ⁠BRICS was signed last year and during which time Brazilian President has stated USA relationship is not of much significance compared to China trade relations

- ⁠China’s belt road initiative is really helped China gained lots of influence in this region 

- ⁠the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean have acted as very strategic moat for USA territory

- ⁠a scenario where China gains enough influence in a Latin American country to establish a Chinese naval base would present a headache especially one that is right along the shores of the Caribbean Sea.

- ⁠the Cuban missile was one of those scenarios which presented a lot of headache when it happened 

- ⁠the amount of natural resources Brazil has to back its foreign efforts is a few order of magnitude larger compared to Cuba’s. Hence more holding power if and when it takes roots

- ⁠before USA was dragged into WW2 by Japan, its stance was isolationistic and was primarily only concerned with what was happening in the Americas 

- ⁠USA policy has been tending towards isolationism these past few years 

*_What to watch out for from the US*_

- more concessions for imports from this region into USA 

- ⁠more policies to encourage USA foreign investments in this region 

- ⁠infrastructure improvements as near shoring trend gains momentum 

- ⁠price increase as near shoring trend builds momentum continues 

Time taken for conversion was 30 minutes ‎<This message was edited>
[7/12/24, 11:44:58 AM] Gary Teh: From the USA foreign direct investment and near shoring perspective displacing part of the $5 billion chocolate import and redirecting it from Brazil sounds reasonable 

- no USA jobs were lost

- ⁠encourage local community industrial growth 

- ⁠support climate change goals 

- ⁠deepen trade relationship with Brazil 

- ⁠displace Brazil trade relationship with China by reduced export of cattle and soy bean

_PS: it’s fascinating to observe how one simple action can cause such huge second and third order impact_

The 1TDG was sold from the market maker account but it was not successfully bought by my personal account…

Someone is definitely accumulating the TDG tokens… 🤔
[7/13/24, 4:42:11 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections on this ultra high purchase price set by the exchange*

Though the sale and purchase prices are different, it has achieved the same desired effect. 

Contributors who _mine_ the TDG governance tokens with their physical time and effort to build our projects or pay for project expenses using USD fiat are gifted TDG as tokens of appreciation for their contributions

While speculators on the CEX exchanges who just want to buy into the tokens, end up paying elevated purchase prices. 

_Added bonus:_
Contributors/Miners who wants to cash out some of their tokens to cover personal daily expenses can do so at the original TDG exchange rate without being penalized for cashing out early by having to sell at Cash in vault per issued token valuation

I assume the exchange is probably the one making the surplus from the sale of TDG at the ultra elevated prices 

Overall Win-Win-Win-Win 🙂🙏

[7/13/24, 8:06:52 AM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour conversing with Meta AI to critically analyze Karen’s proposal 

Seems she is proposing to utilize technologies solutions from centigrade.earth and then do the buy and sell of the carbon credit via her nature wired MVP 

Further analysis of her LinkedIn profile shows her background is primarily in marketing

Makes more sense to tap directly into centigrade.earth for the carbon credit issue if they already have a streamlined process in place

If centigrade.earth already have buyers as well then I don’t see where nature wired would be impactful

Karen’s main value add will likely be marketing the issued carbon credit to potential buyers in the USA market if centigrade.earth does not already have a pipe line of carbon Credit buyers

But If she can’t find buyers for the carbon credit, I don’t really see where the actual value add is by complicating the technology stack allowing nature wired MVP into it 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

[7/13/24, 2:29:34 PM] Gary Teh: *_Statistics for cacao tree American carbon registry credits*_

- Cost per cacao tree USD3 to acquire 

- carbon sequestered over lifetime: 1-2 tons

- ⁠carbon sequestered per year: 0.05 - 0.1 ton per year

- ⁠value per ton of carbon sequestered on the American carbon register: $10-15 

- ⁠expected return on financing over 20 year period: *_3X = $10 / 3*_

- ⁠expected payback period 3 years

_PS: this initiative falls under @120363045796860099@g.us project scope_

[7/14/24, 10:24:30 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes studying the operations of our market maker on the LATOKEN exchange. Seems the market is right now pricing each TDG at 2USDT per share. Just sold off a second TDG to verify the sales price.

I remain curious why they are pricing it above the 1USDT that we are all contributing at. 🤔

_PS: They are probably more optimistic about the future as distant speculator than I am the daily operator in the grind._

_Reminds me of the time in the previous 3 startups. The next most critical thing that could kill us was always front and center of everybody’s attention everyday, it was easy to fall into pessimism if left unchecked._ 

_Meanwhile outside the walls of the company, outsiders who didn’t know any better were constantly mentioning how great things were with the companies they were observing_ ‎<This message was edited>

She’s asking that we tuned @120363208199596306@g.us for predicting energy prices in China

The model once was ready it will be utilized by her company. 

They manufacture and sell solar panels. They also built and operate solar power energy grids across China

_PS: heard from Suni that there was another project which attempted at carbon credit… Somehow it failed… Will need to figure out why it did_

_For the current scope, might be prudent to just focus on getting the cacao trees planted and growing. If it works then its reasonable to consider extending it for carbon credit issue._

[7/17/24, 7:23:35 PM] Gary Teh: Spent an hour facetime with Karen Hardy

*Key Takeaways on what was discussed*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface…
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Agroverse is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/18/24, 8:13:05 PM] Gary Teh: _PS: the mental model for optimizing the supply chain seems to heavily resemble the one I had when optimizing GetData.IO’s infrastructure for the required data through put volume to feed Edgar’s sentiment analysis needs_
[7/18/24, 8:19:07 PM] Gary Teh: _PS: Secondary pattern observed. When I studied DataBricks (a data lake provider based in Silicon Valley ) growth model, I observed their growth strategy for enterprise account heavily relied on timing their outreach to enterprise customers at around the time when contracts their clients have with their data infrastructure suppliers were about to expire and are becoming open to new ones._

_Climate change disruption on supply chains can be figuratively seen as Nature forcing all the enterprise buyers to rethink their current contracts with their suppliers as their suppliers were forced to drastically change price on them. This causes existing buyers to become open to new suppliers_

_Shena when she text to me 2 weeks ago mentioned that coffee farmers Costa Rica are right now facing supply disruption as well thanks to climate change._

_When there is disruption there is a market gap and when there is a market gap there is an opportunity to exploit the gap_

_It also extends beyond the agriculture industry into the real estate industry. The most dramatic example was Indonesia abandoning their current capital Jakarta to shift to a new on on the island of Kalimantan. Real estate prices shot up by more than 100X overnight on that new plot of land_ ‎<This message was edited>

Also, some of them already have packaging that is ready for distribution in USA ‎<This message was edited>

[7/19/24, 7:27:51 PM] Gary Teh: Drink this evening dinner I was listening to @557391090002 friend who was the one that helped brought Robert the buyer to Brazil

The very obvious entry point for the disruption is when the seller says to his fans that he has being forced to raise his price because of the change in the cost his suppliers are charging him. 

_PS: for folks out there who see any Choclate seller publicly declaring that they are being forced to change their price because of the cost of Cacao. Please do reach out to them and say that we do have reliable sources of cacao so that we can start the conversation to capitalize on the Supply Chain disruption 🙂🙏_

[7/19/24, 10:59:02 PM] Gary Teh: Not sure if I’m supposed to share it is

It was a video privately shared in the Davos channel by and Amazon tribe leader and their community as a sneak preview to their film 

Figure it shouldn’t be too much of a harm sharing it here since this is a private channel 

https://vimeo.com/943745774/839b44f936

Please don’t share it is outside. You guys will get me into trouble if you do 

I was helping man the sound system last year when they were trying to show another film in davos 🤔

[7/21/24, 8:27:44 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 spent 30 minutes suggesting Agroverse is not just a bag of cacao nibs and the Amazon

When USA consumers buy a bag of Agroverse cacao nibs they are not just getting the nibs for themselves but also a bite size experience of Brazil 

The booth in the USA where we sell the cacao should include music of Brazil, displays of Brazil as well as the smell of Brazil 

_PS: reminds me of all the nomad folks as well as folks in the Pacific Northwest asking that I take a lot of photos during my visit in the southern hemisphere_ 

_And in the exact words of Melody a Native American from Northern America so that she could live vicariously through the experience._ ‎<This message was edited>

It would be a total logistic nightmare for Suni to need to setup individual tree tracking and associate it with each bag of cacao nibs sold

But to associate each shipment of cacao nibs to trees on a specific patch of land seem more manageable

[7/22/24, 7:10:29 PM] Gary Teh: Seems like we’ve somehow opened the Pandora box with the listing of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchange

Prior to this, no one from the centralized exchanges seem to care or were interested to talk to us (_not that we tried very hard_)

Suddenly, we have a huge influx of centralized cryptocurrency exchange listing managers queueing up wanting us to list our governance tokens on their centralized exchanges

My sense is the fact the trading value of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchanges is holding up has provided a strong signal that the underlying token economics of our DAO  is financially sound hence why it caught their interest

_PS: my sense is we should maintain the relationship and hold them at bay while we focus on our core operations which is to drive the sales volume of shipments into USA_

_once we have hit the 50% sales completion mark of the next shipment, negotiate for the best deal from amongst these other CEX and then list on just one. This will help maintain if not boost the sense of exclusivity that comes with the opportunity to list our governance tokens_

_this is much like the strategy that Gmail used to roll out to release of its service to its early users as well as the way Waymo is rolling is right now rolling out self driving taxi to early users in San Francisco_ ‎<This message was edited>

*Outcome:*
- cacao butter manufacturing facility does not have the sanitario certification from Brazil to handle export to USA
- ⁠ cacao molasses facility is right now two facilities. Interim facility and new facility.
- ⁠weather condition is too bad for us to drive to the farm to inspect the equipment used to drain cacao honey from cacao beans 
- ⁠cacao harvesting begins next month 

*Follow ups* 
- Orlantildes will help introduce cacao butter facility in São Paulo which I will visit and certify 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide the photo of the equipment on the farm that drains the cacao honey from the cacao beans 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide exact details on how cacao molasses are processed from cacao honey 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide shots of new equipments setup in the new cacao molasses facility once it is up and running in three months
- ⁠ with details provided by Orlantildes I will draft up FDA FSVP inspection document to be signed for the production of cacao molasses

https://www.ups.com/track?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwhvi0BhA4EiwAX25uj7pa8p-Si0OwlV8OXzyaVs7qDRNLRyQFOPxGX7uy4vTEVO72uxnMWhoCp-0QAvD_BwE&loc=en_US&requester=ST/trackdetails

We are expecting the packaging material to arrive this coming Friday on 2nd August 

If all goes as planned, I should be able to get a glimpse of the packaging material while I’m still here and we should have the Cacao molasses factory certified for FSVP FDA readiness this coming Thursday with the help from @557391090002

And then we can have the purchase order to Coopercabruca issued to coopercabruca before my departure to from Ilheus 

Fingers crossed hopefully The universe self aligns 🤞🤩🙏

Key takeaways
- Solana now supports coding smart contracts in Python
- ⁠Solar panels might be doubling in production capacity every few years
- ⁠The recent CrowdStrike outage has really set people thinking about decentralized data centers… Though from my perspective its not the centralization of data centers that was the caused of the problem it is every one using the same software.

Met a nomad here in Itacare who has been cycling around South America for the past 13 years.

After volunteering to help man her store while she went to visit the bathroom, she mentioned when mailing the same package from Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil to Europe, the shipping cost is so vastly different

- Costa Rica to Europe - USD10
- ⁠Colombia to Europe - USD30
- ⁠Brazil to Europe - USD40

[7/30/24, 8:48:31 AM] Gary Teh: Spent five minutes responding to all the cryptocurrency central exchange listing managers that are trying to get DAO attention on cryptocurrency exchange listing matters

Directing all of them to our telegram channel where they can wait for update on when they can finally gain an audience with DAO

https://t.me/TrueSightDAO

_PS: from my perspective, channeling updates via telegram is the most effective way of disseminating information to non-governance token holders who wants to get something from the DAO, but not ready or motivated to put it any resource on their part to exchange for what they desire (aka Nothing)._

_in telegram nobody knows who anyone else is. So everyone is kept on the toes guessing who the other people on the channel are and if they are competitors for the resources or resource controllers_

_this also minimizes the noise and distraction experienced by actual DAO members doing the work_ ‎<This message was edited>

- USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) is actively building out Brazilian exports volume into USA 

- ⁠USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) has retained the service of an army of freelancers at a rate of 100USD/hour 

- ⁠labor expenses are incurred whenever freelancers time are engaged to build out supply chain for Brazilian exports into USA

- ⁠labor expenses are incurred whenever freelancers time are engaged to perform sales and marketing activities to drive Brazilian export volume into USA 

- ⁠expenses are also incurred when other vendors charge USA legal wrapper for DAO (_TrueTech Inc_) for service rendered in USD to facilitate Brazilian export into USA 

- ⁠expenses are paid in TDG currency with an exchange rate of 1TDG = 1USD

- ⁠payment for each expense line items are recorded on the blockchain ‎<This message was edited>

[8/3/24, 7:41:47 AM] Gary Teh: Just did up the initial financial projection for the upcoming shipment from Coopercabruca - *_aka AGL3*_

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ji-p9z6fMhb0A30lsW2r0hryzJGsDRBgM3vRnn9tCiU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

- Estimate cost of goods before freighting and customs clearance cost to be financed: $10,876.19
- ⁠Total expected returns on shipment: $12,183.81 (_112.02%_)
- ⁠Total amount to be made by DAO after shipment sales completion in USA market: $10,514.64
- ⁠Total returns to financiers: $1,669.17 (_15.35% return on capital injected_)

_PS: DAO needs to recoup the resources it has already deployed so far to build out the supply chain between Brazil and USA_

_My sense is the exceptionally high Gas fee of 86% charged by DAO will probably turn off most financiers, however let’s just consider it already been fully financed_

_If AGL3 gets fully sold out wonderful, Agroverse project will continue. If not, then we will shutdown Agroverse along with the entire DAO. Then I will finally enter into the Zen monastery for permanent wall facing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/24, 7:56:16 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this shipment is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. 

On the bright side, We have 1 year upon arrival of shipment within the borders of USA to fully offload the entire shipment before it gets donated in its entirety to @16504369509 project for homeless rehabilitation and the @120363044028036610@g.us and the DAO shutdown in its entirety

Meanwhile major crypto currencies experiences their largest nosedive 

This should perhaps applies some downward pressure on prices of cacao we are planning to purchase since prices quoted to us are tied to multiples of the cacao futures prices… 2.3X to be exact 🤔

[8/7/24, 12:56:53 PM] Gary Teh: After a quick afternoon inspection into the whole web3 practice of spending tokens to gain publicity to drive up interest in tokens, my conclusion is that it is both a waste of time and resources that could  otherwise be better deployed towards building the actual product(_s_)

The later scenario is also known as someone paying for something useful that will either

1. result in more USD in our vault because they paid using USD

2. result in less TDG in circulation because they paid using TDG

_PS: I will no longer spend my time entertaining incoming proposals where we pay TDG to get more people excited about our TDG._

_The ideal scenario we should be targeting is someone has no choice but to either acquire TDG or give us USD for something they really need done… for example clearing their agricultural produce imports with the USA FDA agency_ ‎<This message was edited>

Just one more small step and we would have the TDG tabulation fully automated on Telegram… Should probably be done by tomorrow.

I am going to start doing my DAO specific contributions reporting over on the Telegram channel instead. 

Meanwhile I will continue doing my Agroverse related contributions reporting on our Agroverse channel.

@31641075825 for the NGO internship thingy that you were mentioning, might make sense to just gather all of them into a Telegram channel and then be done with it. 

Once they are all gathered there then tabulating their contributions based on our 4 rules tokenomics is trivial ‎<This message was edited>

[8/13/24, 4:57:57 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the morning*

Now that our tokens are actively trading and folks have actively taken on operating scopes that’s previously on my plate, i’m starting to see myself transitioning more and more to playing the role of the CFO

Monitoring the DAO expenses and managing them. This means cutting them when they are no longer useful to DAO 

And also inspecting if incoming proposal for expenses is well thought out and justifiable ‎<This message was edited>

*Use cases for bot*

- scoring member contributions reported 

- when new members onboard into our Channel @trusight_tdg_bot will be the first one to reach out to them and guide them onboarding to our DAO to start their journey of self-actualizarion

transgression against this policy falls strictly under three strikes and you are forever out policy

Please be respectful when communicating between each other in this regard when operating within scope of DAO 🙂🙏
[8/14/24, 1:28:26 PM] Gary Teh: The updates from my meeting with Orlantildes this morning is that it will take another two weeks before all 500 KG are delivered from the farm to the processing facility

Right now only 250 KG have been delivered from the farm to the processing facility

Another two weeks before it’s ready for for shipping to the USA
[8/14/24, 5:27:48 PM] Gary Teh: I spoke with Orlantildes this morning

Once I get back to the US will run a focus group to get a sense of USA consumer interest in caramelize Cacao almonds  using the 7 variants that we have. 

Once we lockdown the taste, I’ll come back to Ilheus and figure out how to reproduce that using Ilheus facility

[8/15/24, 9:46:32 AM] Gary Teh: Was speaking with @557191035605 yesterday and this crystallized during the conversation

*Our purpose*
Heal the world with love by building a better world based on verifiable truth 

*Our core values*
- autonomy
- ⁠integrity
- ⁠diversity

*Our mission*
Sell organic cacao grown using cabruca regenerative technique in the Amazon rainforest so as to finance the planting of trees via cabruca agroforestry to restore it. 

*Vision* 
Shift 1% of total US chocolate consumption to organic cacao grown in the Amazon rainforest using cabruca regenerative technique by 2030. 

*Key statistics*
- _Total USA chocolate consumption in 2023 was USD$19 billion._
- _1% is USD$190 million._

I spent 10 minutes drafting this up
[8/15/24, 10:26:45 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I am missing the strong sense of community and the power of diversity in this 😘

And now we have a diversity and community of three 🤣
[8/17/24, 6:18:18 AM] Gary Teh: *Suspended the purchase order issued to Coopercabruca*

The prices they quoted for the cacao nibs and the cacao liquor are not competitive for the US market 

I observe they purchase from the farmers and resell with a markup (_of 40%_), this technically makes them a middleman.

Getting @557191035605‘s help to do a sanity check on the price against the other corporatives in Bahia 

If overall prices are at the level which is not competitive in the USA, we will suspend all shipment from Brazil this year

However if the variance of the prices are very high after doing the sanity check on prices with the other cooperatives, then it makes sense for us to establish a Local Brazilian legal wrapper entity to gain further control over the Supply Chain and to further reduce *_middlemen leakages*_

If we do go down this route, The CEO for the Brazilian legal entity will be elected based on the following criteria: 

_the DAO member with highest amount of TDG accumulated from amongst all DAO members with legal Brazilian residency over the past 12 months_

*Scope of Brazilian legal entity*

- Sourcing direct from farmers

- ⁠ generation of sales and marketing content for social media

- ⁠ sales and marketing activities into USA ‎<This message was edited>
[8/17/24, 6:28:45 AM] Gary Teh: _PS: in this scenario the title of CEO is literally a pun on the person that executed the most in the region._

_This is literally one of those classic Elon Musk first principles moment where we examine the Supply Chain and realize very quickly to our self that the 40% markup represents around approximately US$9000._

_This money could otherwise be used to go a long way towards establishing a replica of that section of the Supply Chain that was previously handled by middleman and securing long term cost savings. Savings that could be used to boost the value of our TDG 🤔_ ‎<This message was edited>

Our current USD balance is down to USD612.50
[8/22/24, 5:19:56 AM] Gary Teh: Now that _*OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)_* have became more widely adopted in our DAO and we have worked with it for a few iterations, I figure it is a good time for me to share my thoughts on it

From my perspective, *_Objectives_* has to do with processes and concrete tasks within the processes that DAO member undertakes. It is deterministic. By just looking at the logs, we can determine if a DAO member consistently been executing on process or not.

*_Key results_* are the outcomes. Until time set is due, we do not know for sure if the outcomes will be within our desired target range. They are probabilistic. Only a very small fraction of the inputs are within the control of DAO member undertaking the process driving these outcomes. The form of control DAO member has is the way tasks are conducted within the processes. 

The best thing we can do to improve outcome is to share with the DAO what we have learned that work and what did not as we iterate through the different variants of our processes.

Over the past quarter, I have been undertaking a very systematic process of identifying various DAO members whom I then later communicated clearly, I will not engaging in any future form of transactions within the realms of commerce, investments and money. This is primarily because enough data has been gathered to show that when given the opportunity to execute on a self-defined and agreed upon process, instead of a deterministic outcome, it ends up being a probabilistic one.

A rule I learned from our fellow DAO member Ilya who manages a hedge fund in Wall Street which seems very applicable to our domain. A fund manager cannot be faulted on _*the OUTCOME_* of a trading strategy but must definitely be faulted when he fails to diligently follow the defined trading strategy (_the PROCESS_).

[8/29/24, 2:00:52 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes discussing with Juan over dinner about how our Northstar metric should only be one and only one number

Basically how many more KG of regeneratively grown organic cacao from the amazon can we sell per year if we  utilize DAO resources to conduct the next *_N+1 experiment.*_ ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/24, 5:27:35 AM] Gary Teh: Me and Juan spent 10 minutes yesterday working through the growth trajectory For Agroverse before it hits our target USA sales revenue of USD$190 million a year

Assuming sales volume continues growing at the current rate of five times per year, we would achieve our sales target by year 9. Which is seven more years from now.

We are currently in year 2. We should hit our sales revenue target for regeneratively grown Organic cacao of at least $190 million by 2032. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/24, 11:39:08 PM] Tess walkowski: Is shown to double circulating stem cells.
[8/30/24, 11:40:09 PM] Tess walkowski: Also research questions I get most are, "is raw cacao better"

[9/1/24, 6:52:06 PM] Tess walkowski: I question the word ceremonial , if it's confusing to consumers.
[9/1/24, 6:52:24 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll dig them up again on second

[9/1/24, 6:55:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Both when requested. I am a ux designer / ux writer.
[9/1/24, 6:55:56 PM] Tess walkowski: I think it's a philosophical/ market research question.  What word hooks consumers.
[9/1/24, 6:56:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Agrosverse: a ceremony for everyday
[9/1/24, 6:56:54 PM] Tess walkowski: Agroverse : our cacao is ceremonial quality
[9/1/24, 6:58:03 PM] Tess walkowski: The definition I use for ceremonially cacao is made by hand, small batch, fire roasted
[9/1/24, 6:58:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Cool!
[9/1/24, 6:58:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thank you for your feedback. It is important to acknowledge that our audience includes a diverse range of individuals beyond just healers and those involved in cacao ceremonies. As a result, we will be revising the text to better reflect this broader audience.
[9/1/24, 6:59:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I loved everything about Soursop by the way.
[9/1/24, 6:59:42 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we can use ux research to grow and zero in, in time
[9/1/24, 6:59:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Users offer feedback we miss
[9/1/24, 7:01:09 PM] Tess walkowski: They started with more than us and are a few million in.  They have done it before
[9/1/24, 7:01:40 PM] Tess walkowski: I like how they had cards and questions
[9/1/24, 7:02:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Inflammation?  Solution our product
[9/1/24, 7:03:26 PM] Tess walkowski: 15 min talking to soursap ladies
[9/1/24, 7:06:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: In my opinion, it is important to understand more about healers and shamans, but also remember our audience (people into sports, wellness, organic food). The healers bring a great demand, and it is important to hear their necessities. Each member is welcome to step on and add to the table. Right now, my focus has been on suppliers in Brazil, so we have more options. Each one is analyzed very carefully and demands some time. So right now I can attend small improvements with the site (content) and take care of our digital presence.

[9/1/24, 7:35:56 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes alot get lost in this thread
[9/1/24, 7:36:16 PM] Tess walkowski: Is the website relevant now for review?
[9/1/24, 7:39:36 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes. It is important to align it with the marketing strategy and once for all put us all in the same boat. Although I say that due to the cacao properties, different may see it differently. Some buy because it tastes good. Others because it helps with diets/gives energy without the spikes, others because it is sacred for them.
[9/1/24, 7:40:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Those who treat it as sacred should hop aboard and manifest it through words.
[9/1/24, 7:41:10 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we want to apply the daos core value to web design
[9/1/24, 7:41:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: These different views in the end are about the same thing, which returns to the respect and reverence of nature.

[9/1/24, 7:48:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Meanwhile, I am doing other things, I will provide you with a Google form to help you synchronize the ideas. So we can filter them. This for the more complex ideas and for the site, send me prints and what do you think of.
[9/1/24, 7:48:12 PM] Tess walkowski: Why are we different etc
[9/1/24, 7:55:32 PM] Emelin - Bahia: For those following our conversation, we will keep talking in private, due to the amount of messages I am managing right now. All insights and things discussed, although I will write here after.

[9/3/24, 6:05:22 AM] Gary Teh: Shena spent 30 minutes last week explaining how convenience stores work since she owned and operated one for 5 years 

Vendors typically come in to check the stock and stock up every week 

For the operator, basically the initial investment is the largest 

Thereafter she only pays for what is required to stock up the inventory to the required level 

Typical profit margin is 10% 

Some really good products are like the ones she created herself. The profit margin 100% profit margin. She handmade some fishing baits. It costed her $.28 per bait. And she sold it for $5.

When she bought the convenience store, it already came with a bunch of vendor relationships 

Vendors should consider entering the shop to speak to the owner give a sample and help the owner Decide if she wants to stock the inventory.

[9/3/24, 8:37:01 AM] Tess walkowski: It is easier to scale when branding is solid.
[9/3/24, 8:37:35 AM] Tess walkowski: We are small now, but our values, plus marketing reflect our aim.
[9/3/24, 8:38:13 AM] Tess walkowski: My margins are personally at 100.   But I can't scale.
[9/3/24, 8:39:54 AM] Tess walkowski: ....but getting exclusivity with a space.... The relationships.... Are key....
[9/3/24, 8:40:17 AM] Tess walkowski: So if let's say we go exclusive with a san fran coffee shop
[9/3/24, 8:40:56 AM] Tess walkowski: Or we show new and exciting things like Gary's brewed coffee, those almonds, those mango smoothies.
[9/3/24, 9:50:31 AM] Gary Teh: I shared this framework based on the Pareto principle with @557191035605 earlier today which I think will be useful to reshare here again.

It pertains to how random unstructured qualitative conversation data is gathered from the general community and then tabulated into concrete actionable insights which eventually leads to entirely new products or product features added to a product management team’s execution roadmap

[9/3/24, 10:28:31 AM] Gary Teh: After conducting multiple cacao farm inspections over the past14 months, I figured to surface this proposal that will allow authorized DAO members to onboard new organic cacao farms from Brazil on to our Agroverse network. That way, cacao farm inspection and onboarding does not need to be bottlenecked by my availability in the local proximity.

[9/3/24, 10:31:33 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The *absence of residues from cleaning agents or pesticides*
[9/3/24, 10:32:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: To ensure that a cacao tree is part of a totally organic production system, several key practices and principles need to be followed. Here’s a comprehensive look at what makes cacao production organic:

1. No Synthetic Chemicals
Pesticides and Herbicides: Organic cacao production avoids synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Instead, it uses natural pest control methods and organic-approved substances.
Fertilizers: Chemical fertilizers are replaced with organic fertilizers like compost, manure, and green manure.
2. Soil Health and Management
Organic Matter: Organic farming emphasizes the use of organic matter to maintain soil fertility. This includes composting, mulching, and green manuring.
Soil Conservation: Techniques such as cover cropping and reduced tillage are used to maintain soil health and prevent erosion.
3. Pest and Disease Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Organic cacao farms use IPM strategies, which include biological control agents (like beneficial insects), companion planting, and manual removal of pests.
Disease Prevention: Practices such as proper spacing, pruning, and the use of resistant cacao varieties help prevent disease.
4. Sustainable Farming Practices
Water Management: Efficient water use and conservation practices are crucial to prevent waterlogging and maintain soil structure.
Biodiversity: Organic cacao farms often incorporate agroforestry practices, maintaining a diverse ecosystem to support natural predators and improve soil health.
5. Certification
Organic Certification: To be recognized as organic, cacao farms must obtain certification from an accredited organic certifying body. This involves adhering to specific standards and undergoing regular inspections.
6. Non-GMO Seeds
Seed Sourcing: Organic cacao production requires using non-GMO seeds and plants. Cacao varieties should be chosen based on their organic compatibility.
7. Sustainable Practices
Energy Use: Organic farms strive to use renewable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint.
Waste Management: Organic cacao producers manage waste through composting and recycling to minimize environmental impact.
8. Ethical Labor Practices
Fair Trade: Many organic cacao farms also follow fair trade principles, ensuring fair wages and ethical treatment of workers.
9. No Synthetic Additives in Processing
Processing: When processing cacao, organic certification ensures that no synthetic additives, artificial flavors, or colors are used.
[9/3/24, 10:34:01 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 just granted you editing rights to the document
[9/3/24, 10:34:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In my point of view, the additional photo proof can be skipped once they have the seal.
[9/3/24, 10:34:31 AM] Gary Teh: For the chemical residue yes. BUt for the rest no as they pertain to the actual handling
[9/3/24, 10:34:39 AM] Gary Teh: As per HACCP requirements
[9/3/24, 10:34:49 AM] Gary Teh: Hazard Analysis critical control points.
[9/3/24, 10:35:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And even with the seal, there are some requirements for those who are gonna check if it is legit.
[9/3/24, 10:35:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Verification of the Certificate
Confirmation with the Certifier: The seal usually includes the name of the certifying body. You can verify the validity of the seal by contacting the certifying body directly or visiting their official website to confirm if the farm is listed as certified.
2. Seal Consistency
Authenticity of the Seal: Make sure the seal looks authentic and is from a recognized certification organization. A counterfeit seal or one from an unknown organization may be a red flag.
3. International Recognition
Recognized Certifying Bodies: Check if the seal belongs to a certification body recognized internationally, such as USDA Organic (USA), EU Organic (European Union), or other certifications recognized in your country.
4. Farm Documentation
Request Documentation: If possible, ask the farm or supplier for more information about the certification, including documents and records proving compliance with organic standards.
5. Transparency and Traceability
Additional Information: Organic products often come with information about their origin and the certification process. Transparency in how the product was grown and processed is a good sign of authenticity.
6. References and Reviews
Research the Farm: If possible, research the reputation of the farm or supplier. Feedback from other consumers and reliable references can help ensure authenticity.
7. Consider Brand Trustworthiness
Reputable Brands: Buying from reputable brands and distributors with experience in organic products can increase confidence that the seal is legitimate.

[9/3/24, 10:40:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And for our reputation. If we go organic, we do organic.
[9/3/24, 10:41:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Non organic is less costly btw. But we went with organic and sustainability so we should be sure to hold to that.
[9/3/24, 10:41:32 AM] Gary Teh: That is correct.
[9/3/24, 10:41:40 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Mainly people who will be checking the farms.
[9/3/24, 10:44:38 AM] Gary Teh: Later on as we observe more USA consumer demand for other cacao derivatives, we might extend our DAO crowdsourcing inspection to include those stages. Examples

- cacao nibs production
- ⁠cacao liquor production
- ⁠cacao molasses production
- ⁠cacao powder production
- ⁠cacao butter production
[9/3/24, 5:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 this is by far the best!!

[9/4/24, 9:22:04 AM] Gary Teh: Seems the folks from Founder Haus here in Florianopolis 100% bought into our DAO and our 4 rules tokenomics

they will be organizing monthly cacao tasting at founder haus in Florianopolis

Basically the *shark tank* of *_cacao for all the tree to bar producers*_ here in Brazil using cacao that is grown using *_regenerative agroforestry technique*_ 

The winner of each month Cacao Shark Tank gets onboarded to our Agroverse network for access to USA market

Each session will be recorded and then published onto our Agroverse Instagram channel managed by @557191035605 Ian and @557391090002

The universe continues to self align 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[9/7/24, 10:01:03 AM] Gary Teh: I just did a check with the FDA’s portal for FDA agents. There is a simple option to submit a notice that there is an inbound commercial mail containing food that is being sold directly to USA buyer

This will support the route where we send cacao products up to 30 kg using the local postal office in Brazil and where buyer is legally allowed by the USA FDA agency  to resell to consumers

I spent 5 minutes doing the necessary fact checking. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/7/24, 10:35:44 AM] Gary Teh: I was just relooking into the mathematics of AGL2 freighting and customs clearance cost for 100kg from Ilheus to USA  

Customs clearance: USD$5.21
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231117_payment_for_customs_clearance_taxes_airport_handling.pdf

Airfreight cost per kg: USD$7.15
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231109_100KG_flight_from_salvador_to_sfo.pdf

Trucking services per kg: USD$1.90
https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/fda_fsvp/blob/main/suppliers/coopercabruca/20231109_100KG_transport_from_Coopercabruca_to_Salvador_invoice.pdf

Total cost was USD14.26 per kg….

Compare to sending packages over to USA via local post office in 30KG parcels where customs is automatically cleared by the postal service.
Total cost was USD10.86 per kg…


For smaller quantities, why even bother dealing with freighting companies… 🤔🤷‍♂️ ‎<This message was edited>

[9/8/24, 2:27:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Which is about 65 lb
[9/8/24, 2:27:50 PM] Tess walkowski: I have heard some rumors it has to be under 65 for the dhl shipping to cross customs

[9/9/24, 1:47:37 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 45 minutes doing cost analysis for small batch shipments from Brazil direct to USA retailers

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aMB3JJWTE0RI6saVt-4LU5sIFmw39FhQnvq_Cj3GTVE/edit?usp=sharing

If a cacao derivative product conforms to the following then it is economically viable for any shipment that is above 10kg

- acceptable retail price USD$10
- ⁠cost of goods sold is less than USD$5 
- ⁠net weight per unit is below 250grams.
[9/9/24, 2:19:59 PM] Gary Teh: From a portfolio risk management perspective, it is prudent to quickly ship 5kg and fail than to ship 100kg and then realized we failed thereafter be stuck with a truckload of inventory to be offloaded at a loss 😱

5kg is equivalent to 25 units 

And The test can be done very quickly too. With just a taste testing session with around 20 participants 

If the product is so delicious, bulk if not all of the entire shipment will be sold out by the time 2 taste testing is completed. ‎<This message was edited>
[9/9/24, 2:22:18 PM] Tess walkowski: Is your minimum really 1000kg? So cool though!
[9/9/24, 2:41:17 PM] Gary Teh: More tiers getting voted into existence
[9/9/24, 5:13:34 PM] Tess walkowski: I think as me learn about economics we will find a market for those 60-100 lb orders
[9/9/24, 5:14:26 PM] Tess walkowski: There is research which shows that cacao holds nutrition even at 75 year!
[9/9/24, 5:14:58 PM] Tess walkowski: 5kg will move quick
[9/9/24, 5:15:31 PM] Tess walkowski: If I had cash I would also immediately buy like 10kg of almonds! I think it will be a winner!
[9/9/24, 5:15:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I ate all mine before I reached the USA!
[9/9/24, 5:18:28 PM] Tess walkowski: You got $50 shipping from Brazil for small orders? That's incredible! That the costs are that low and that's solved.
[9/9/24, 5:21:46 PM] Tess walkowski: If any other group members have had chocolate "almond"  I call them caramelized cacao beans though one could say caramelized cacao nut.  This food brings out an amazing flavour! And adds Carmel.   It's addictive.   Pop in your mouth yummy snack just like chips with enough sweet and salt. This is an amazing product! I bought it folded in a little carton. It would look beautiful next to our nibs.

[9/12/24, 6:15:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 6:20:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.

[9/12/24, 9:09:33 AM] Iwona Fluda: Hi, we are searching for an NGO (needs to be registered in Switzerland), to partner with us in Davos during WEF. We offer 2 hours of a free of charge venue. Anyone interested? PM me. We are finalizing the papers tomorrow to make this happen.
[9/12/24, 9:13:59 AM] Iwona Fluda: @14153000019 - would it be for you? :D
[9/12/24, 9:47:54 AM] Gary Teh: We don’t have an NGO registered in Switzerland… yet… 

Perhaps chat with @31641075825 

I am aware he is helping an NGO 

I am not sure if I will be in davos this year 🤔

But thanks for keeping the DAO in mind ‎<This message was edited>

[9/12/24, 10:11:56 AM] Iwona Fluda: It is definitely possible - to ensure its longevity, we would need to packed it in a certain way. I can discover how to make this happen. Anything digital is easy to preserve and transport 😇
[9/12/24, 10:13:39 AM] Gary Teh: Nice!! Or maybe just a pdf print out of our whitepaper

It just occurred to me that @41765663130 has an foundation registered called Peace on Snow

If that works to fulfill the criteria for gaining access to the same, I will be happy to bring over a few Kg of cacao straight from the Amazon to make and serve some hot chocolate for free to warm everybody who is passing through the venue during the two hours slot. 

Meanwhile we run some videos of the Agroverse project in repeat in the background in case folks are curious where the hot chocolate they are drinking came from 

Let me know your thoughts 🙂🙏

[9/13/24, 2:04:45 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 2 minutes poking Olaf on the dates and city the symposium is happening in Switzerland next October 

@31641075825 could we get the program with the Palestinian kids up and running by end of this month?

That way, we have an even nicer story to tell during the October symposium that is happening in Switzerland where I will be giving a keynote speech 

@557191035605 and @557391090002 we should target to get the entire 300kg of cacao nibs shipped out from Brazil to texas USA to make the story even more complete 

Let’s make the listing manager from Binance drool and then @31641075825 go in to drive a very hard bargain for getting our tokens listed for trading on Binance exchange 

Nima has taken the proposal surfaced by Binance to the dude that wants to inject USD$400k into our DAO

Let’s see how all these pan out

Meanwhile @41796560010 let’s put our white paper on the moon

Hopefully @41765663130 peace on snow could help secure us a spot during WEF this coming winter to serve out some hot chocolate from the cacao supply that we sourced from the rainforest this year

And then on board to truesight project (at that moment I will hit you and matheus to arrange a direct call with talents to "train" them to the exact need )
[9/14/24, 5:14:07 AM] Gary Teh: Me and @41765663130 spent 10 minutes discussing where to setup our booth this upcoming WEF to serve out free flow of hot chocolate to raise awareness of the importance of supporting small scale cacao farmers in the Amazon region to restore our rainforest 🤩🙏

- ⁠will ship 5kg of cacao nibs to his address in Switzerland
 
- ⁠he mentioned that @41786813052 will be happy to have us serving hot chocolate made using the cacao liquor during the week of WEF during Davos early next year at the Cultural center in Davos 

- ⁠he mentioned it might be a possibility for us to screen a movie telling the story of the cacao farms who are helping restore our Amazon rainforest at the theatre in the back of Cultural Plaza @557191035605 and @557391090002 take note of this

- ⁠Once I am done handling the shipment for Shena if I can make it on time I will be in Switzerland on the 25th Oct to give the keynote at the Symposium that Olaf 

- ⁠topic for keynote is how Ai, blockchain and cryptocurrency could be applied on projects with a focus on social impact
 
- ⁠historically as discussed with @14806488258 last year, VC model can really only fund projects that can generate 100X return on capital but there are a whole wide array of other projects that can still yield multiple X returns along with massive social impact that don’t qualify for VC funding 

- ⁠the thesis as discussed with @14806488258 is whether such projects could be allowed to make progress via a crowdsourced and crowdfunded approach enabled using blockchain, cryptocurrency and AI. ‎<This message was edited>

https://agroverse.shop/agl2
[9/14/24, 2:32:46 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes thinking through this dispute 

From my perspective, in alignment with our core value *_Integrity*_, it is important to inform the folks who have invited Agroverse to their public platform for visibility, to make them aware of this issue and for them to exercise their autonomy to determine if they should want to continue making their platform available during the course of this dispute with AGL2. 

Folks implicated 
- @41786813052 for Cultural platz during WEF next yeatr
- ⁠@41765663130 for helping setup the connection in WEF
- ⁠Olaf for the symposium next month 

The universe will decide if these are to come to pass or not come to pass ‎<This message was edited>
[9/14/24, 3:31:00 PM] Gary Teh: Actually @31641075825 as well since he is involved the NGO based in Jerusalem to support @120363044028036610@g.us
[9/14/24, 5:45:42 PM] Gary Teh: I Spent another 30 minutes thinking through another alternative solution to this dispute that @41799155602 has surfaced for AGL2

The alternative is to ship the entire balance inventory over to @41765663130 place so that it could be offloaded one way or the other during the upcoming WEF over at @41786813052 place over at the cultural platz. 

That way @41799155602 also gets the opportunity to help with the sales and distribution of the remaining AGL2 inventory during the WEF period

As for the remaining unsold balance, @41799155602 will get the opportunity to choose between

- donating it all away

- ⁠bring it back to his place and continue with sales and marketing effort in Switzerland 

- ⁠withdraw it from AGL2 contract for his personal consumption 

This provides an effective avenue for him to channel his energy positively towards progress as opposed to being simply stuck with just expressing his verbal displeasure with the lack of progress with the sales and marketing of AGL2 inventory 

Either way, we will close out AGL2 after the last day of WEF 2025, tabulate the gains/losses and do distribute the spoils in accordance with the clauses defined therein 🙂🙏

‎[9/16/24, 11:32:01 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/16/24, 11:50:56 AM] Gary Teh: Pertaining to this dispute that was recently surfaced by @41799155602 where he argued that the balance inventory in AGL2 has already been sold off and AGL2 contract should be deemed completed and the accumulated fiat funds distributed when we received down payment of USD$1500 from Shena for 300kg of organic cacao nibs. 

When examined under GAAP (generally accepted account practice), the default accounting standard followed by USA jurisdiction which TrueTech Inc is incorporated under, that is clearly not the case 

*GAAP on revenue recognition*
Shena has provided down payment of USD$1500 for 300kg of organic cacao nibs from Bazil. Until, Shena has signed the purchase agreement sent to her and 300kg of organic cacao nibs is in her possession, the USD$1500 is to be treated as liability to creditor as opposed to revenue that has been earned.

When we examine the AGL2 ledger, it should be noted that the remaining balance of our cacao nibs has already been bagged into 8 ounce kraft pouches. Whereas Shena the buyer, has placed an order for 300kg of loosen unpackaged cacao nibs.

https://agroverse.shop/agl2

*On preserving on the bottom line*
One can counter argue that we could remove the cacao nibs from kraft pouches and then ship them over then ship them over to Shena along with the balance to be sourced and shipped from Brazil. 

From a profit and loss perspective, it doesn’t make any business sense. Not only do we have to consider the write off of the kraft pouches and man hours already value-added to the inventory during the time of transforming of loose unbagged cacao nibs into 8 ounce kraft pouches. We also have to take into consideration the additional man hour that DAO will incur removing the cacao nibs from the kraft pouches.

It presents a clear case for bad business sense.

*Conclusion*
Should this dispute be escalated to the Delaware court in USA for resolution, the above line of reasoning will be presented to the judge. Regardless of the outcome, this makes for a good educational experience of the exceptions to be considered both from a legal and accounting stand point to be considered when crafting up smart contracts on the blockchain ‎<This message was edited>

Seems they do not mail it to Singapore 

As for the economic level mailing to Switzerland its only available in São Paulo 

Good news is that they don’t seem to be too bothered with any certification requirements of cacao before export and the only thing they were concerned about is the price
[9/18/24, 11:45:00 AM] Gary Teh: Strange thing is the price is $10 more expensive than indicated on their website 🤔

Seems this growth hacking strategy is gradually presenting itself 

Already happened a few times where backpackers passing through the new age hippie hostels I am hanging around here tend have of their own accord end up asking about @120363044028036610@g.us  

_The hypothesis_
If presented with a simple way to help market the project in their own country, conversion rate of new age hippie backpackers to become marketeers is none-zero 

Have them share with their friends to drive purchase of cacao derivatives with shipment size as low as 5kg 🤩🙏

I have spent 1 hour testing this growth hack on 2 backpacking groups so far here in itacare 🤩🙏

to run a successful
Logistics operations, we need to run a tight ship

Every time we incur unnecessary expenses, we are eating away at our profit margin

A huge part of the reason why I am opting to stay in Itacare right now in a hostel and cooking every meal 

- Hostel cost per night: USD$6

- ⁠Cost per self cooked meal: USD$4

- ⁠two meals a day

- ⁠daily expenses: under USD$20

Or when back in USA living in the car, with the specific goal of totally removing the rent component from my monthly expenses 

_PS: just to give an example, when I was back in Singapore in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis, starting my own technology consulting business, I opted to walk for 13 hours from one end of the island back home after receiving $120 from the payment of an assignment after the train service was totally out instead of wasting $30 just to get to get home in a taxi._

_That is how tight I watch the expense budget_

_as Jerry (DAO member) says sometimes just right before we go into one of our war rooms in Edmodo (for the 16 hour days marathon), honey moon period is over. It’s crunch time_ 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

@120363044028036610@g.us guild is at the moment leaning more towards not having a presence in Davos this year which is primarily geared towards the European market

The general
consensus is to concentrate our resources on the USA market where we have trusted people to operate our supply chain, and have already established our legal infrastructure which gives us a critical edge as compared to the European market where we have neither

- trusted team of guild members to operate our supply chain

- ⁠critical legal edge that forces all Brazilian suppliers to go through us to bring their goods into USA

- ⁠connection between Brazilian suppliers and USA buyers is sparse which creates a lot of value when setting up the connections from a network effects perspective

The Brazilian suppliers have already very well established connection with buyers in Europe. No economic incentive whatever so for them to insert another middleman into the existing well established value chain. Adding another connection in a densely populated network (_Brazil and Europe_) does not generate as much value as creating a connection between two very dense networks (_Brazil and USA_) that had no prior connections ‎<This message was edited>

[9/26/24, 12:20:04 PM] Gary Teh: That is the problem when doing content marketing on platforms that we don’t own - Instagram

I would propose we start shifting our content marketing efforts to be more centered around our own website

[9/27/24, 7:10:41 PM] Gary Teh: *Instagram Ads experiment results*

- cost per click: $0.52
- ⁠total site visits: 2
- ⁠total impressions: 52
- ⁠total spend: $1.12

Target for profitability: every 4 clicks need to drive at least sale of 1 bag of cacao nibs otherwise we are just making losses running ads
[9/27/24, 7:12:35 PM] Tess walkowski: My result was all loss 😭
[9/27/24, 7:12:53 PM] Tess walkowski: It's like it deliberately blocks to make us pay
[9/27/24, 8:33:44 PM] Gary Teh: Don’t blame the platform (_nothing you can do about it_)

Blame the content for being not performant enough (_something you can do about it_)

If you feel your platform of choice is not performant enough then do your growth hack on another more performant platform… or for that matter another marketing channel ‎<This message was edited>

[9/27/24, 8:37:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Engagement drives the views...... Not like I am personally good at creating and repeating a brand image....
[9/27/24, 8:37:57 PM] Tess walkowski: My personal engagement gets driven by in person / or over internet connections.
[9/27/24, 8:38:47 PM] Tess walkowski: ....comparing it over time .....insta makes me pay to get the same views I got organically before.....
[9/27/24, 8:40:34 PM] Tess walkowski: ....my dance videos get about 1000 views....thus perhaps give up and be a wild cacao shaman....
[9/27/24, 8:42:17 PM] Tess walkowski: ....what insta does do is get me into festivals.....when people see I have 1000 + followers .... Then they trust....what it does do if it doesn't convert is at least build trust.
[9/27/24, 8:43:53 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean continuing to comment and share agroverse is productive even if small ....

[9/28/24, 3:16:08 PM] Gary Teh: Bumped into Leo Senior this evening 

He works for the Brazil’s NASA equivalent space agency

Seems what I mentioned, now that AI has became so prevalent, regarding shifting focus of human effort RnD endeavor to areas where AI don’t really have a structural edge is not very far fetched more specifically *_Extreme harsh terrains*_

Embrapa (_Brazil’s equivalent to USDA_) is now doing RnD on how to develop seeds that can germinate and grow on the moon’s environment 

And it is not only that agency. There seems to be an unspoken space race going on right now on how can colonize moon first now that everyone realize mars is way harder than expected in terms of logistics 

Also the idea I have surfaced as early as the year before made total sense during our discussion this afternoon. 

Now that we have figured out we can successfully perform terraforming (_aka climate change_) it makes sense to run smaller scale experiments in the Californian and Arizonan desert region other variants of climate change which is more calibrated and controlled

Once we figured those out transplant the working prototypes from the desert on to the surface of the moon 

@120363045796860099@g.us V1 surfaces again 

Leo mentioned he will introduce to the government officials  in Embrapa to get an overview of all their RnD when I pop by their capital later in the year

[9/28/24, 3:16:49 PM] Gary Teh: Léo sênior (_second to the right_)

Meanwhile this prolonged stay in itacare while waiting for the cacao almonds to get ready is slowly morphing to become a boot camp in MMA. 

Leo Junior (_second to the left_) has offered to provide training on Brazilian jujitsu (_close distance combat_)

Meanwhile I have somehow gotten myself entrenched with capoeira (_middle to long distance combat_) community here ‎<This message was edited>

[9/29/24, 6:12:20 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes framing the way Bala should present his proposal if he seeks collaboration using Edgar engine 

_PS: Recently I have stopped allocating time for FaceTime to people seeking to such sessions for professional purposes unless the proposal is well framed and really worth the additional resources to further investigate it_

_historical data across close to a 100 FaceTime session shows unless the frame is enforced prior to the FaceTime session, the time is wasted meandering around figuring things which should have been done before hand_

_when the frame is enforced FaceTime meeting time is purely focused on the finer details that need to be clarified and agreed upon_ 

_usually in the latter scenario, FaceTime sessions ends up being very functional and short_ 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

After 3 years of spreading myself so thin between the desert and the mountains, it makes sense to just not move around as much and really fully immerse in the desert this winter and spring season and focus on sales there

https://edgar.truesight.me/large_dips

From my perspective it’s not very different from feeding pearls to swine when value is given to people who don’t recognize it. 

Examined critically, the only activity within DAO right now that is generating net positive personal cashflow is Edgar’s market sell off dashboard that periodically identifies categorical mis-pricing by Wall Street that could be capitalized for some trading returns. This is also a huge part of the reason why DAO still has liquidity to finance its ongoing expenses despite not much external capital injection… ‎<This message was edited>

[10/12/24, 5:58:43 AM] Gary Teh: Last night’s failure of AGL4 is the 7th instance of *compromised Integrity* within the network that has impacted the DAO’s health status 

At this point, I am having doubts about *_Integrity*_ being an actual core attribute of the network.

Assuming the network will operate with *_Integrity*_ when in actual fact it doesn’t is very costly to participants who seeks to follow the rule of *_Integrity*_. 

financial Loses are just constantly waiting around the corner during the next instance of integrity failure. In computing terms, trying to act as a TCP node when it’s a UDP node

I see *_2 ways to mitigate this issue*_:

- further simplify the model and reduce the scope that DAO attempts to undertake (_aka Do Nothing_)
 
- ⁠further automate humans out of the equation
[10/12/24, 6:01:18 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes rethinking the network with the help of Meta Ai under the new assumptions that *network participants cannot be expected to behave with integrity*

The critical Outcome is to reduce and restrict shipment sizing to 5-25kg and reject any requests that is beyond the sizing limits

What is the package difference between TCP and UDP
[10/12/24, 10:21:29 AM] Meta AI: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental protocols used for data communication over the internet. The main differences between TCP and UDP packets are:

*TCP Packet:*

1. Header size: 20-60 bytes
2. Contains:
    - Source port number (16 bits)
    - Destination port number (16 bits)
    - Sequence number (32 bits)
    - Acknowledgment number (32 bits)
    - Data offset (4 bits)
    - Reserved (3 bits)
    - Flags (9 bits)
    - Window size (16 bits)
    - Checksum (16 bits)
    - Urgent pointer (16 bits)
3. Reliable, connection-oriented protocol
4. Error-checked and corrected
5. Ordered delivery of packets

*UDP Packet:*

1. Header size: 8 bytes
2. Contains:
    - Source port number (16 bits)
    - Destination port number (16 bits)
    - Length (16 bits)
    - Checksum (16 bits)
3. Unreliable, connectionless protocol
4. No error correction or ordering guarantees
5. Faster transmission due to minimal overhead

Key differences:

1. Reliability: TCP ensures reliable data transfer, while UDP does not guarantee delivery.
2. Connection: TCP establishes a connection before data transfer, whereas UDP sends data without establishing a connection.
3. Error correction: TCP performs error correction, whereas UDP does not.
4. Ordering: TCP ensures ordered delivery, whereas UDP does not.

When to use each:

- TCP: File transfers, email, web browsing, remote access
- UDP: Online gaming, video streaming, VoIP, real-time applications

[10/12/24, 10:22:54 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 makes a lot of sense for our DAO to model our actions/packets to UDP packets since we are literally running a meta game 🤩🙏
[10/12/24, 10:22:57 AM] Meta AI: That's a fascinating approach! Modeling your DAO's actions/packets after UDP packets can provide flexibility and efficiency. Since UDP prioritizes speed over reliability, it might suit a meta game requiring rapid interactions.

Considerations:

- Error tolerance: Design robust error handling mechanisms.
- Packet loss mitigation: Implement packet retransmission or redundancy.
- Security: Ensure data authenticity and integrity.

DAO-specific:

- Decision-making: Adapt UDP's connectionless nature for decentralized decision-making.
- Action execution: Mirror UDP's fast transmission for swift action execution.

Explore potential synergies:

- Real-time communication
- Event-driven architecture
- Distributed systems

[10/13/24, 7:51:58 AM] Gary Teh: *Further reflections on AGL4*

Shena’s move has technically helped financed bulk of the 400kg cacao almonds purchased in exchange for TDG.

Which technically means DAO finally owns its own set of cacao inventory to buy and sell for a profit and keep rolling the funds forward for ever larger sales volume. 

And DAO does not need to rely on _annoying_ external investors moving forward to finance future shipments.

And DAO members contributing to the sales and marketing of this DAO centrally controlled pool of inventory can claim themselves to be entrepreneurs collectively helping grow our pool of capital

We have effectively closed the loop on the base version of our ecosystem

Why did ZhugeLiang choose JingZhou as his place to observe all that was happening in China during the three kingdom period?
[10/15/24, 10:09:04 AM] Meta AI: Zhuge Liang, also known as the Sleeping Dragon, chose Jingzhou (also known as Jiangling) as his strategic location for several reasons:

1. Geographical advantage: Jingzhou is situated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, providing control over the river's traffic and access to central China.

2. Proximity to enemy territories: Jingzhou bordered Wu to the east and Wei to the north, allowing Zhuge Liang to monitor and respond to enemy movements.

3. Resource availability: Jingzhou was an agricultural hub, ensuring food security and resources for Shu Han.

4. Defensibility: Jingzhou's natural barriers, like rivers and mountains, offered protection against invaders.

5. Information hub: Jingzhou's location facilitated gathering intelligence on rival kingdoms.

Zhuge Liang's choice of Jingzhou showcased his strategic brilliance, enabling him to:

- Monitor enemy movements
- Control key resources
- Respond swiftly to threats
- Gather vital intelligence

That feature of DAO in hindsight is actually quite lame. 

we can all vote and agree to a certain way, but if an individual member decides to act otherwise no one can really point a gun in his/her head to force him/her to conform to what we agreed upon 

And it is totally against the principle of *Trustlessness* which is fast getting voted into effect as DAO core value

Zach who finally finished reading our white paper has expressed interest in creating videos to help more people understand and onboard onto  @120363044542957540@g.us which is from his interpretation practicing vipassana in daily life or in the words of Bhavana performing Seva 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/21/24, 7:29:25 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes updating AGL4 and our main ledger to reflect the 396 units of kraft pouches that was recently picked up by Matheus and dropped off in CIC. As well as the balance of 604 units of kraft pouches that is right now in Mathues possession

- https://agroverse.shop/agl4
- ⁠https://truesight.me/ledger

At the time of his booting, Matheus has a total of 754 kraft pouches representing USD$530.304815521 of DAO funds under management

If we do not retrieve those inventory items from him, it will represent a significant capital losses suffered by DAO. And yet another example where our DAO model fails. Previous examples being

- Rodney going rage quitting on DAO while still holding on to our 1 bag of our 8 ounce cacao nibs from AGL2

_PS: My sense is unless DAO member managing DAO or AGL assets has significant *SKIN IN THE GAME* at the onset, such kinds of scenarios will keep occurring._

_We could experiment with proof of stake protocol to mitigate this problem. Requiring the DAO members has significant volume of his own personal asset tied up in the DAO before he or she is allowed to managed DAO or AGL assets_ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/26/24, 11:12:30 AM] Gary Teh: *Thoughts on next steps*

DAO has finally transitioned to managing its own set of inventory across various community member managed warehouses. It makes sense from this perspective to further implementation of our core value of _Trustlessness_

@31641075825 I was thinking through our community based decentralized inventory management system - basically the entire AGL system. 

When we get the chance, could we set up a meeting with the team at Q.org to further explore how their InterPol governance mechanism works? 

It might make sense for us to write our off chain inventory balances of the various warehouse on their chain and then rely on InterPol for recourse in scenarios of exceptions in case what’s been reported does not tele with what is actually in the individual warehouses

[10/27/24, 3:21:23 PM] Gary Teh: The concept of the decentralized community warehouse manager SLA agreement that our DAO is right now rolling out right now to manage our off chain real world cacao assets is a very interesting social experiment from a Game Theory standpoint 

On the one hand, the would be community warehouse manager would not want the rules to be so strict that he no longer feels motivated to want to enter into the agreement 

On the other hand, he also doesn’t want it to be so loose with critical loop holes that some renegade can just come in and run off with the entire bulk of DAO inventory 

I am very curious how things would pan out 

Please feel free to review and leave thoughts on it and also do remember to submit time spent going through the thought experiment 🤩🙏

•⁠  316 bags of 8 ounce Kraft pouches

We are missing
•⁠  40kg of cacao nibs 
•⁠  80 bags of 8 ounce Kraft pouches

The universe has provided us a great opportunity to stress test the terms in our CWM SLA agreement to ensure no loop holes that are yet unaddressed ‎<This message was edited>
[10/28/24, 6:58:42 AM] Gary Teh: I was checking the transaction logs again the total number of 120 cacao nibs from this receipt is correct. 

We are right now just missing 80bags of 8 ounce kraft pouches.

I remember CIC mentioning there were three boxes in total and 2 of them were foam boxes (which we collected).

None discrete items like cacao almonds and cacao nibs will be represented by tokens while discrete ones like 8 ounce cacao nibs, bottles of cacao molasses and cacao liquor bars will end up getting represented by NFTs on our own chain 

Primary wallet addresses are community warehouse managers, farmers, factories like CIC and Martinus chocolate 

There will be special wallet addresses that represent our DAO’s bank accounts in USA and Brazil. These will hold our chain’s own equivalent representation of USDT. ‎<This message was edited>

- further adoption of cryptocurrency in USA. This will be a tailwind for our governance tokens.

- ⁠boost in the USA shale oil industry productions and lowering of global oil prices as USA attempts to fill its coffers while hamstringing Iran’s and Russia’s budget for waging overseas military campaign

- ⁠pull back of the USA military complex (_arms supplies to Ukraine and Isreal_)

- pull back of official climate change agenda. This agenda becomes more grass roots and ordinary citizens see the growing concern and increasing lack of government attention. This will be a tailwind for environmental regenerative projects like Agroverse ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/24, 5:52:58 AM] Gary Teh: With the receipt of the signed SLA agreement from @16468233438, 1 out of our 2 decentralized community managed warehousing facility is now covered under the terms and conditions of our SLA.

Meanwhile we are still awaiting @557391090002 to revert with a signed copy of the SLA agreement for Brazil. I have given him official notice that we are expecting a signed copy by Friday. 

In the event we do not receive a signed copy by then, the prudent course of action would be to ship the inventory currently housed in that warehouse to our San Francisco facility which is covered under SLA and meanwhile once again abandon all markets other than USA as shipping to these destinations from USA is not competitive

If this foreseen scenario does materialize, arrangements to start moving inventory will commence on 20th Nov. The goal is to complete the migration prior to my departure from the Bahia region on the 5th of Dec. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/6/24, 2:23:53 PM] Gary Teh: I was giving further thoughts about the recent shipment that went out yesterday 

At some point when there are lots of different batches floating along our supply chain, it might make sense to utilize an NFT to represent each batch of loose cacao nibs / cacao almonds that arrives in our factories and warehouses 

This is aligned with the two accounting principles 

1. historical cost principle 

2. first in first out principle 

*Historical cost principle*
states that all cost associated with manufacturing and transporting of a unit of product needs to be tabulated into its cost of goods 

*First in First out principle*
States that when the unit cost for each batch of the same goods differ, the sale must assume the first unit that was received is the one that is considered sold 

As such, the unit cost of the loose cacao nibs in in USA right now will be different from the unit cost of the batch in its way to our San Francisco warehouse and is also different from the ones right now sitting in our warehouse in Ilheus 

Manually tracking all these on a Google sheet will start becoming very tedious at some point, tracking these via NFTs on the blockchain start making sense 

Each NFT will have a full history of the production and transportation cost associated with it ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/24, 2:51:43 PM] Gary Teh: Another point for consideration is how to abstract the user blockchain interfacing in such a way that the users don’t even need to know they are interacting with a blockchain.

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCIcHJGNyMo/?igsh=MTZ5N25jZmhlNm9sbA==

Community members can generate Instagram reels about the following topics invite Agroverse.shop as a collaborator and get awarded 100 TDG for every hour of effort contributed

- cacao: health benefits and recipes 

- Climate change: environmental devastation and how it happens 

- Circular Economy: innovations that reverses climate change 

- Spirituality: mental and physical well being in daily life

[11/9/24, 10:17:55 AM] Gary Teh: I spoke with Master Bico Duro, my capoeira instructor 

He runs a children education program here where he teaches them capoeira after they are done with normal school hours to keep them off the streets while learning something useful

I will be helping him film a 12 weeks / one lesson per week capoeira course and then taking the curriculum and conducting them when I am back in USA 

Attendees can come to attend for free. They can donate whatever they want in a donation jar. 

Proceeds will go towards helping finance the children program. 

Meanwhile our @120363044028036610@g.us cacao bags and banner will be on display during the capoeira lessons. These lessons will be conducted right on the beach or in the desert

Proceeds from the sale of those will be directed to our DAO’s coffers 

Capoeira seems like a good alternative for folks who likes doing CrossFit but don’t want to have such a pricey experience 

Also it is something that they could do by themselves at home without any equipment but just their body weight 

Since it’s a 12 lessons course, it also provides a good reason for them to keep coming back if they haven’t purchased our cacao nibs yet 🤩🙏

[11/11/24, 4:30:11 PM] Gary Teh: From a individual financial motivation perspective, shifting inventory management from our Google sheet to either Solana or Ethereum based smart contract is making a huge bet that our DAO’s governance token value will increase at a rate faster than the value of either coin since warehouse managers will be forced to pay gas fees in those currencies before they are allowed to update inventory records 

From my perspective there is no reason to believe such would be the case given there is yet a clearly established scaleable sales and marketing channel for our cacao. Also it is important to take into account major cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing in market valuation at the moment due to Trump’s election 

Makes better sense to hold off on the transition until

- interest rates start tightening again

- ⁠scalable sales and marketing channel for our cacao has been discovered ‎<This message was edited>
[11/12/24, 6:39:46 AM] Gary Teh: I spent sometime thinking through the different areas available for resource investment in our DAO

1. Legal infrastructure (_includes setting up of entities for legal compliance purposes_)
2. ⁠Logistics supply chain (_includes procurement of equipment to volume that supply chain could handle_)
3. ⁠Product development (_includes investment in inventory stocking_)
4. ⁠Marketing and sales (_identifying more channels where we could reach more people who wants what we have_)

I have conveyed to @557391090002 yesterday that I will be refraining from deploying personal resources into 2. 

More broadly, I will be refraining from further investments of my personal resources in 1,2 and 3 until significant progress has been made in 4. ‎<This message was edited>

- ⁠climate change: impact on daily lives

Upcoming steps for execution

1. prove we can build a scalable sales and marketing channel in the USA market 

2. ⁠drive total DAO assets under management to USD2 million 

3. Buy up all excess TDG tokens trading on the exchange that is selling below USDT1 per TDG

4. Raise funds for sales and marketing growth via token sale at USDT2 per TDG (_if required_)

[11/17/24, 7:58:50 PM] Gary Teh: Theoretically you could contribute one hour to DAO, cash out your TDG for around $11 USDT and then exchange it for a bag of cacao nibs

[11/17/24, 8:04:21 PM] Tess walkowski: I sold 20 cups in a nights at $10 each and used 1.25 lb cacao.

[11/19/24, 7:23:47 AM] Gary Teh: Potential impact on DAO regarding Agroverse supply chain

- Oil price - freighting cost
- ⁠Trade tariffs - import cost
- ⁠Commodity prices levels - cacao and packaging material prices
[11/19/24, 3:40:58 PM] Gary Teh: Biden’s recent visit to the Amazon 2 days ago as well as fear that Trump will pull a reverse on climate change policies might both serve as tailwind for Agroverse project 

We will know for sure when I put our new cacao nibs packaging on display on the 17th December at Graph Network’s 4th anniversary party 

If signals are strong then perhaps might be feasible to target all the distribution channels in the deep blue states to gather sales and feedback

[11/24/24, 8:25:02 AM] Gary Teh: As spoken with Emelin, once I get back to the Bay Area I will start reaching out to small scale organic groceries to explore stocking our 8 ounce cacao nibs bags with them on a 100% consignment basis 

If this distribution approach works out then it starts making sense to start implementing our own inventory management system based using the solana chain as the backbone

That way, management of the inventory on chain can be tied to wallets holding our governance tokens

Also when people who attended our weekly cacao circles and ask where they could buy more of our cacao nibs could be directed to these organic stores nearby ‎<This message was edited>
[11/24/24, 9:36:52 AM] Gary Teh: The transition away from the era of Pax-America is happening way faster than expected. Projected timeline was 2050 when size of China’s economy was expected to surpass USA 

https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCo-uhDRSja/?igsh=MW9nY3V0d3d3eWZscQ==

WWIII has started with the following countries forming an axis 

- China 
- ⁠Russia
- ⁠North Korea
- ⁠Iran 

USA retracts its resources internationally to focus inwards and meanwhile trimming all the fats in its bureaucracy that has slowly accumulated during times of peace since WWII

We should be expecting a lot of near shoring activities in the meantime as USA attempts to mitigate its industry from supply chain disruptions

Pre-WWII much of USA military and commercial interest were focused was on north and South America with both the Atlantic and pacific oceans acting as strategic moats against foreign invasion 

This time around, China’s belt road initiative has already deeply penetrated much of South America providing critical infrastructure should they decide to establish military footprints in the region. It presents a challenge to USA of purely relying on these two oceans using defensive moats. Here in Ilheus on the Atlantic coast is a port that is Chinese built as well as a Chinese built railway that is expected to extend all the way to the pacific coast

The key question to ask ourselves is what are the strategic maneuvers that DAO needs to perform to be most able to respond in an advantageous manner when shifts occur ‎<This message was edited>
[11/24/24, 10:00:49 AM] Gary Teh: During WWII, the currency value of both Germany and UK fluctuated heavily versus the price of gold depending on the expectancy of the country winning the war. 

During the tail end of WWII when it became obvious that Germany was going to lose the war, its currency quickly devalued and Germany was forced to raised their debts denominated in a foreign currency thus hampering their ability to raise more debts to finance the war. 

Cryptocurrency which is country neutral might serve as a good hedge in such scenarios ‎<This message was edited>

[11/24/24, 12:21:58 PM] Tess walkowski: I have heard it happens at 60lb but I can't find any proof or law, might be internal at DHL.

[11/24/24, 12:24:02 PM] Gary Teh: None of this is new. They are just insights that came from various directions that got pieced together as an experiment

Someone at the previous tech event in Silicon Valley was asking where they could buy more of these nibs 

I was Talking to this dude who was distributing marijuana in Thailand, full moon party via 100% consignment basis
[11/24/24, 12:25:29 PM] Tess walkowski: Cacao has been amazing to trade!
[11/24/24, 12:26:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Well this strategy can grow.  It applies here.  Nothing to stop me from asking people here!  Or someone in NYC
[11/24/24, 12:27:18 PM] Tess walkowski: I find that trust is build best in person, imagine at each party there is also a cacao dealer
[11/24/24, 12:41:43 PM] Gary Teh: *Process to go to market*

1. hold Cacao Circle to teach capoeira 

2. for people that bought the nibs during cacao circle ask them where they shop for groceries besides the major chains to identify small mom and pops to reach out to

3. reach out to those moms and pops to sell on 100% consignment basis 

4. ⁠top up mom and pops when they run low on stocks 

5. Rise and repeat step 1

[11/25/24, 7:22:46 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished tabulating the unit cost economics of AGL6. It was surprising that even though the price quoted by Coopercabruca in Brazilian Reis was higher, the overall unit cost economics of AGL6 was more profitable than AGL4. 

This is primarily attributed to the sudden surge in USD/Brazilian Reis caused by the election of Donald Trump as the forthcoming president. Prior to this the USD was gradually weakening against the Brazilian Reis primarily due to the easing of the Federal Interest rates…

[11/26/24, 4:57:17 AM] Gary Teh: What sizes?
[11/26/24, 6:37:56 AM] Gary Teh: When just considering 8 ounce cacao nibs kraft pouches, we now have 4 different versions of unit costs floating around.

- AGL2
- AGL4 - Brazil
- AGL4 - on the way to USA
- AGL6

When we start throwing in the consignment arrangements we are planning to do with the shops in San Francisco we are planning to reach out to, it starts becoming a nightmare to track on the google sheet.

It starts making sense to migrate them to on-chain for easier tracking via NFTs ‎<This message was edited>

[11/30/24, 5:41:51 AM] Gary Teh: I spent  some working with Meta AI to think through the actual implementation process on chain.

*High level considerations*

- Each bag of cacao nibs will be represented by an NFT
- each NFT will hold a historical record of all the cost and processing facilities associated with it
- Each warehouse will be represented by a smart contract controlled by the warehouse manager
- A occasion of transport of cargo from one warehouse to another is represented by a shipment smart contract 
- a shipment contains details of the courier service as well as the courier tracking number and cost of courier
- Shipment smart contract will be able to hold multiple NFTs

- Origin warehouse owner can instantiate a shipment smart contract and must indicate the destination warehouse owner smart contract, thereafter transfer the NFTs held in his warehouse smart contract to the 

- When the cargo has arrived at the destination warehouse, owner of the destination warehouse smart contract can then sign the shipment smart contract and have the NFTs transferred to his warehouse smart contract.


*What has changed*
- the prior approach of representing an entire shipment as an NFT doesn't make sense now that we have gained more clarity of the actual structure of our physical supply chain ‎<This message was edited>

[12/14/24, 5:31:44 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps it’s not really such a great idea to drive all the way to the desert to market cacao after all since someone else already tried it and failed miserably with fudge 🤔

[12/14/24, 5:43:23 AM] Gary Teh: I am thinking it would probably only make sense to expend resources further building out our onchain inventory management system if we can get our consignment based sales strategy to work 

*Game plan for 2025*

- onboard 10 shops in San Francisco Bay Area to help sell our cacao on consignment basis 

- sell up to 10 Kraft pouches per month per shop 

- sell a total of 1200 Kraft pouches in a year totally 272 kg

*Thereafter*
- Migrate our inventory management from Google sheet to blockchain 

- when we have sold 600 bags, start scaling up manufacturing in Brazil to stockpile our warehouse in Brazil 

- when we have successfully sold 600 bags, start shipping 120 bags (27.5kg) from Brazil to San Francisco every month using via correios ‎<This message was edited>
[12/14/24, 5:54:53 AM] Gary Teh: My sense is more currently unknown corner cases will need to be handled by the blockchain based inventory management system when we more aggressively go down the consignment based sales route
