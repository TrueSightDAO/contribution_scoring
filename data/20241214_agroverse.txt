[9/25/22, 4:02:03 AM] Johnson Teh: Tks, as mentioned my sg tech Coy is now tapping to onboard Indo farmer with a B2G initiative. 

But believe the key is logistic and managing of these farmers, for these areas to stay poor for so long their poverty DND must be super strong, 
so the tech fix must enable in a quick and impactful way
[9/25/22, 4:07:13 AM] Gary Teh: Could you help elaborate what DND means?
[9/25/22, 4:07:27 AM] Johnson Teh: Sorry DNA
[9/25/22, 4:10:28 AM] Francois renet: Thanks @14153000019 for being such a source for good!
[9/25/22, 4:11:43 AM] Francois renet: i can try and help with the commodities. If everyone could do a quick message with what they are looking for, or have to offer, I can try and put something together to match supply and demand.
[9/25/22, 4:21:47 AM] Youna Kim: Now that K-food and ingredients are so popular, I can create restaurant brands in the region with planners, and franchise ingredients from Korean and African farmers in other cities with the unique character of the region.
[9/25/22, 4:24:27 AM] Youna Kim: I think it would be a good idea to arrange an opportunity to go on a preliminary research tour of this project. Then we get to know each other better and real things happen

@6598383264 is tapped into an entire network of Michelin restaurants

@6581766589 team has built out the FoodLens platform which is right now recording agricultural product from farms in India. 

We could either tap into his Foodlens platform later on to record the available inventory (rolling out in USA, Keyna, West Africa and USA) or utilize the one that @6598383264 team has been commissioned by the Indonesian government to do build depending on which one is more suitable for our technology backbone.
[9/25/22, 9:43:36 AM] Gary Teh: @6581766589 do you have the URL to the market place you described in your pitch deck?
[9/25/22, 9:46:23 AM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 right now we are exploring the supply side. 

The goal is to see what is available by next week and then next week @6598622082 and @821071361022 take the list to the restaurants and cafe in their network to see what resonates with these operators and then figure out the pricing and logistics after that.
[9/25/22, 9:59:19 AM] Francois renet: The easiest way for my contact is to know what people are looking for as food commodities is just one aspect of her business. I believe she's back from Ethiopia today, and I can ask her to put together a list of what she has access to and we take it from there? You know me @14153000019 i don't like to over promise and under deliver!
[9/25/22, 10:25:24 AM] Gary Teh: Ok! Looking forward 🤩

[9/25/22, 10:34:20 AM] Gary Teh: I am starting to see clearly both @6581766589  and @6598383264 are pursuing a B2C model. This might work for domestic food production and distribution in countries that are self sufficient. 

The B2B model we are pursuing makes sense for cross border food distribution to countries that are not food self sufficient. Since that aspects is its own beast and requires its own set of logistics and financing model.
[9/25/22, 10:38:19 AM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‎You changed the group description
[9/25/22, 10:38:50 AM] Francois renet: for sure @14153000019 , and even more complicated now that the supply chain is broken. So in effect this requires both food innovation, and distribution innovation
[9/25/22, 10:39:33 AM] Gary Teh: yup. Agrihood scope is focused on food innovation. 

EcoVerse21 scope is focused on distribution innovation

These two projects are complementary. 😁
[9/25/22, 10:40:50 AM] Francois renet: If only we could combine both solution @14153000019  🙂
[9/25/22, 10:41:24 AM] Gary Teh: Based on what I have read so far from multiple sources, the supply chain disruption is going to get more and more disrupted over the rest of this decade. As trade war continues, aging population concerns causing staffing to become strained
[9/25/22, 10:45:35 AM] Francois renet: same goes with food, and several countries talking about stockpiling their resources to meet the need of their own population. energy and food shortages...that is a very worrying combination
[9/25/22, 10:46:12 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, it's a cleaner architecture solutioning wise for each project to have a well defined scope. That way participants of the each projects can focus their attention on very specific mission. 

Otherwise, we will end up with one huge monolithic beast that becomes really hard to maintain and extend in the long run. And also makes it hard for participants to comprehend the full model since a person familiar with one area might not be familiar with the other. 

Best to just abstract the other areas into their own black box.
https://microservices.io/
[9/25/22, 10:46:35 AM] Gary Teh: The problem is just going to become worst overtime
[9/25/22, 10:48:12 AM] Gary Teh: we utilize the micro-services design principles  a lot when designing engineering solutions.

It will also make it easier for new participants to come in with their own network without having to concern themselves with how the other aspects are implemented. Their component will work so long as they implemented our defined interface

[9/27/22, 12:17:41 AM] Betty: Here is a list of supplier and what they offer 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NaGz2ufAgMFI-eeDpbdF3l87bb-azycX5ZdOTQKoXE/edit?usp=sharing
[9/27/22, 12:18:20 AM] Betty: In Nigeria.
Buying directly from.manufacturers is much more cheaper
[9/27/22, 1:11:55 PM] Gary Teh: Could we get your help to find a shipping company based in Lagos to handle the outbound? 🙂
[9/27/22, 1:12:50 PM] Francois renet: On that subject. I was just told by a friemd is the shipping industry that cost are going way way down.
[9/27/22, 1:12:56 PM] Gary Teh: We will do outreach of shipping company on the Singapore side once we assembled the list and showed them to the restaurants in Singapore
[9/27/22, 1:13:06 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful 🤩
[9/27/22, 1:13:29 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps due to the global shortage of demand for non-essentials
[9/27/22, 1:15:39 PM] Gary Teh: I am studying the global supply chain routes to figure out where each African countries’ exports usually go 

Bulk of food supplies are right now headed for China since that country is not self sufficient when it comes to food production 

Seems on the European side, food production in the Mediterranean region is more than sufficient to support its population 

Likewise in north and South America food production can support the population there
[9/27/22, 1:15:49 PM] Francois renet: No more lack of containers. They are not stuck in ports anymore
[9/27/22, 1:16:38 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! I think everything is going to normalize to pre-pandemic by spring 2023
[9/27/22, 1:18:47 PM] Gary Teh: @821071361022 could we get your help to come up with a logo for EcoVerse21?

[9/28/22, 12:11:15 AM] Gary Teh: Actually I don’t even know how we will be able to establish a foothold in the oil supply chain originating out of Nigeria into Western Europe
[9/28/22, 12:23:59 AM] Betty: Yeah that part will need a lot of concerntration but speaking with exporting companies I believe they'll advice best based on that
[9/28/22, 5:36:26 AM] Francois renet: i can help with that
[9/28/22, 7:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: That would be perfect!!  🤩
[9/28/22, 7:35:49 AM] Gary Teh: If we can link up at least one trade route then we have a minimal working base which we can start experimenting with 

- crowdsourcing of funds for funding the trade 
- redirecting part of the surplus from trade back to the African communities
[9/28/22, 7:02:50 PM] Youna Kim: If you guys can visit Korea for Ecoverse21 gathering on 27th-28th October. 
I can arrange join the event in Korea. It will be very good experience and networking. I also can ask for providing the accommodation in a beautiful Hanok stay. 
also I will guide  more than that. 
Just let me know^^
[9/28/22, 10:55:09 PM] Youna Kim: I have a connection with VC in Dubai. If it becomes concrete, I think I can ask for more information etc.

[9/30/22, 9:17:56 AM] Gary Teh: @19514467219 Referencing these two maps, I wonder if it might be possible to setup two routes with Nigeria on the Western Hemisphere 

Oil from Nigeria to Europe 
Wheat from US into Nigeria
[9/30/22, 11:41:40 AM] Gary Teh: After further digging, I observe much of the exports from the eastern African coast are primarily destined for East Asia specifically China which is not self sufficient food production wise 

I understand that Singapore mainly relies on its asean neighbors for food supply 

Since those food containers are going to be passing through its ports anyways let’s see how we can tap into that supply chain 🙂
[9/30/22, 11:45:19 AM] Gary Teh: @821071361022 once the list from @255659580499 and @254729080961 becomes available would be great if you could check if any cafe, restaurant or grocery store owners in your network would be keen to stock some 

@6598622082 I wonder if there is an association for small independent grocers in Singapore 

@19514467219 your contact based in Ethiopia might come in relevant for the portion of the trading network off of eastern coast Africa 🙂
[9/30/22, 12:01:43 PM] Francois renet: she is still in Ethiopia. possibly working on the natural gas deal...
[9/30/22, 12:01:55 PM] Francois renet: but she's a rockstar!
[9/30/22, 6:07:01 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect!!
[9/30/22, 6:09:06 PM] Gary Teh: @6598622082 do you think it will be helpful to get an introduction to the executive team of Chope.co to figure out the BUY side for food supplies coming out of east coast Africa? 

https://www.chope.co/

If it is, I can make that happen. I am familiar with their board member 

Let me know 🙂
[9/30/22, 6:16:45 PM] Vincent Song: Hi Gary, as far as I know, Chope is a restaurant listing consumer facing platform. I don’t know if they go into the supply side of things for the restaurants. 

If the board member is a restauranteur or supplier, they can give us a bit more insight to the purchasing patterns of local restaurants.
[9/30/22, 6:23:25 PM] Vincent Song: I am still unsure if the local restaurants will bite-shift to African suppliers. Cos consistency of supply and consistency of quality are really key for them. We can only try. 

Perhaps you can ask that board member if they think there’s an appetite to diversify to sources from Africa?
[9/30/22, 6:37:42 PM] Johnson Teh: Dude since you know them you can Just ask for their needs (provided this need is what we can provide, else is like asking for fun not fund)

But I do agreed they might not be so
[9/30/22, 7:22:03 PM] Gary Teh: 👍
[9/30/22, 7:55:45 PM] Gary Teh: @6594897484  I just recalled my family is familiar with a distributor who has a stall in the Telok blangah seafood distribution center 

If you do source any seafood supplies while you are in East Timor while you are there, we can hook up the supply chain with his side.
[9/30/22, 7:57:59 PM] Gary Teh: He regularly brings in seafood supplies he source from fishermen in Indonesia as well. So I think he will be open to stock supplies from East Timor
[10/1/22, 7:24:14 PM] Gary Teh: Reaching out now to my ex-business partner whom we ran a pretty large import (China, Thailand, Malaysua and Singapore) export (US, Australia and UK) eBay operation when eBay first launched in Singapore

He used to operate around 100+ hawker stalls in Singapore, before he sold it off to run a master franchise in China for informatics before the bunch of us started the whole import export idea. 

Let’s see if he is keen. If anyone call pull off the China BUY side in my network. I think he is the most likely person. If that works out then I think we should be able to link up the East African SELL side and the China BUY side 🙂

[10/1/22, 8:21:18 PM] Gary Teh: @255659580499 and @254729080961 once we have the list ready. I will forward it to Lawrence he will check with his distributor contacts in China 🙂

1. Chick peas 
2. Pigeon peas 
3. Black pepper
4. Cloves 
5. Tea 
6. Cashew nuts 
7. Green grams

[10/1/22, 9:00:56 PM] Gary Teh: @6598622082 seems these are already exported from Kenya into Singapore

Tanzania to Singapore

[10/1/22, 9:25:11 PM] Johnson Teh: Traders make their money by tiny margin and high barrier to entry … So that they can reach almost oligopoly over time n make bigger money
[10/1/22, 9:26:47 PM] Johnson Teh: Lots of their risks are in Credit and logistics … so it is very tough to get into their trade
[10/1/22, 9:27:21 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Got it 🙂👍
[10/2/22, 1:55:49 AM] Francois renet: Let’s find out!
[10/2/22, 2:50:52 AM] Gary Teh: @6598383264 mind sharing the details on the profit margin generated when you shipped that container of navel orange from Australia to China that one time? So that we can get a sense. 

Based on our records when running the eBay import export operation, our profit margin typically range from between 5% to around 80% depending on the SKU. However the nature is different because those are retail items. 

The most extreme one was finity. That was when I had the “stupid” idea of picking up a rubber seed I picked up when hiking in the jungle and listing it for sale on eBay. It sold for USD5 and it costed me nothing 🤣

Speaking of which I remember my friend, the master forager mention you could harvest quantities of seaweed from the Northern Californian coast if you picked up a cheap commercial license from the national park service. 

And I also remember there was a Singaporean who was shipping boxes of seaweed to Japan for USD5,000 per box. He was just gathering all those freely on the beach 🤔

I remember a friend whose family operate a really large scale farm out here in California. 

I could just reach out to her and get her to make an introduction.
[10/2/22, 2:52:32 AM] Gary Teh: Lawrence was a very very strong sourcer. Some of the stuff he is able to get us at the price points, I wonder how he even pulls it off 

The problem with consumer retail SKU is their typical shelf life is around 3-4 months
‎[10/2/22, 3:26:11 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/2/22, 3:26:52 PM] Gary Teh: There business model is simple.

City dwellers pay USD500 upfront for the season. 

This money is used to finance the seed purchases of farmers 

Every day once harvesting season starts city dwellers get a delivery of a box of vegetable greens placed at their doorsteps. Whatever is in the box is whatever gets harvested by the local farmers

The end consumer shares the risk along with the farmer 

https://openfoodnetwork.ca/
https://juniperfarm.ca/
https://www.nutrafarms.ca/


This is the google keyword to find more companies like these 

“home delivery network canada for agriculture products”

What happens during off season is interesting
[10/2/22, 3:28:09 PM] Gary Teh: Since nothing gets produced in Canada during winter these networks need to source for food supplies for their clientele base further south
[10/2/22, 3:29:25 PM] Gary Teh: That is where companies like these ones come into play 

https://www.proorganics.com/

https://www.profilecanada.com/companydetail.cfm?company=2185544_Wild_West_Organic_Harvest_Coop_Richmond_BC
[10/2/22, 3:31:41 PM] Gary Teh: These are the companies that establish relationship with farmers from out of state for example California 

The delivery network operators would probably get invited to the farms of the Californian farms to get a sense of the growing situation and build relationship with them by these intermediaries 

Come off season the delivery network operators would reach out to the intermediaries to place and import order for produce from a specific farm they visited
[10/2/22, 3:34:11 PM] Gary Teh: I would assume the convention for the hook up be pretty much the same if the source is from Africa 

Northern America is probably not a good destination for export at the moment 

The insight I got was that well water has to be exotracted from increasingly deep depth 

At great depth, ground water is too salin for agricultural use. It is going to cause crop failure at some point if the trend is not reverse. However glaciers the source of these ground water are melting away right now
[10/2/22, 11:17:54 PM] Betty: There are companies that deal on this in the city
[10/2/22, 11:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: That is wonderful! Could you extend the document you shared with the ores too?

Also could you source for a shipping company in Lagos that could handle outbound shipments from the port. 

I will follow up with Lawrence on the China side. 🙂
[10/2/22, 11:22:34 PM] Gary Teh: Following up with Jayan right now who used to work for the Singapore port of authority as well as shipping stuff within the region to figure out how shipping is being done.
[10/2/22, 11:23:18 PM] Gary Teh: @6598622082 what function does Enterprise Singapore Africa Desk serve? How can we tap on them?

[10/2/22, 11:55:12 PM] Gary Teh: I spoke a friend of mine who was the cofounder of Spin. They ship mini-scooters from China into US and we’re setting up manufacturing facilities in Morocco. They are using this shipping service 

https://www.flexport.com/

It seems all encompassing and does port to port delivery 

Tentatively unless otherwise I think we have enough details for shipping matters until exceptions surface 

Now let’s just fully focus on the BUY side 🙂

If what Mariam said today is true then it’s probably BUYing season for food produce in the northern hemisphere as we head into winter 🙂
[10/3/22, 12:09:34 AM] Betty: I'll contact the available ones and list them out

[10/4/22, 12:42:34 AM] Vincent Song: Broadly, ESG supports the BD work of Singapore companies looking to connect with companies in those countries.
[10/4/22, 7:15:57 AM] Gary Teh: Got it. 🙂
[10/4/22, 8:45:45 AM] Gary Teh: I was thinking through the interfacing. There are two approaches we could tap into them 

Approach 1: Passive. Have them introduce new Singapore companies hoping to source for supplies from Africa. We become their trading partners 

Approach 2: Active. Have them introduce us existing Singapore companies looking to expand into Africa. We reach out to check if they are keen on sourcing for supplies. My hunch is some of them accounts for the existing imports already happening. We can help expand their import volume 

@6598622082  thoughts? 🙂
[10/4/22, 8:46:51 AM] Gary Teh: From their perspective, we are an African company even though there are Singaporean faces in this company 🤣
[10/4/22, 4:15:33 PM] Vincent Song: Yea but we will need to have the catalogue of products first. They can then link us up with the right type of companies.
[10/4/22, 4:15:41 PM] Vincent Song: Or trade associations
[10/4/22, 4:49:00 PM] Gary Teh: Great! I am still owing that catalogue now that @971561302188 @255659580499 and @254729080961 have all submitted the kinds of produce that are available 

My conversations with Jayan and Tushar and Zaizhuang the past two weeks has helped enlightened the shipping process

[10/6/22, 12:55:41 PM] Francois renet: hey guys! we were talking about the notion of time recently. Thought i'd share this painting by Artist Maria Linares Freire
[10/6/22, 12:55:47 PM] Francois renet: With Physics in mind I would like to introduce my work "Cogs of Time", inspired by the book "The Order of Time" by Carlo Rovelli. This painting reflects the relativity of time. How time is an ilusion and reality is timeless.Thanks for the motivation

[10/6/22, 1:17:29 PM] Gary Teh: Yea!! I like his the whole Yin and Yang is also represented in this drawing 🙂
[10/6/22, 1:19:42 PM] Francois renet: Her entire body of works centers around it! Doing an interview with her for our magazine this month!
[10/6/22, 1:20:22 PM] Gary Teh: Are they all in display somewhere? 🙂
[10/6/22, 1:21:54 PM] Francois renet: I think at a museum in Paris at the moment. Coming soon, we will be creating virtual viewing rooms of the works by the artists we feature!
[10/6/22, 1:25:22 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! 🤩
[10/6/22, 5:34:50 PM] Gary Teh: @6598622082 I consolidated the list on this google sheet. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbbrDWe-LhxEPTBCJQQoiIGy-3uffZaGu0KWu7PZBWs/edit?usp=sharing

Let's try to reach out to Enterprise Singapore Africa desk and check if we could be referred to the relevant trade associations. 🙂
[10/6/22, 5:35:04 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/6/22, 5:35:49 PM] Gary Teh: Let's also check if they need more parameters and we could get the help of @255659580499 @971561302188 and @254729080961 to revert to the local supplies for more details
[10/6/22, 5:35:55 PM] Vincent Song: Hi Gary, this is a list and not a catalogue? I can ask them but usually it comes with more details of the origins and even photos
[10/6/22, 5:36:57 PM] Vincent Song: Friday and sat are off days for the ME. let me ask them early next week
[10/6/22, 5:37:45 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. Mind sharing what other columns for missing for this list to become a catalogue they can use for decision making. 🙂
[10/6/22, 5:39:18 PM] Vincent Song: My memory is hazy now cos it’s one of many things we look at. But I do recall pictures, pricing and origins are prob things in a catalogue
[10/6/22, 5:40:09 PM] Vincent Song: Anw, lemme just bounce this off it’s Nairobi office to see
[10/6/22, 5:40:50 PM] Vincent Song: I can try get a meeting for ya since the regional director there owes me a great deal but I won’t join in the meeting
[10/6/22, 5:47:38 PM] Gary Teh: Before we get that meeting perhaps get try to get this list looking somewhat resembling a catalogue 🙂

Any idea the KPI the director needs to meet for his job? 

That way, we can structure our talk in such a way he stands to gain from engaging in helping us move this project forward
[10/6/22, 5:48:29 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding pictures do we need actual photos of what is actually there in these African locations or some photos downloaded from the internet will do? 🙂
[10/6/22, 5:48:52 PM] Vincent Song: Let me send the list to him and ask him early next week?
[10/6/22, 5:49:15 PM] Vincent Song: See what else he thinks is needed
[10/6/22, 5:49:42 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect! 🙂
[10/6/22, 5:51:18 PM] Vincent Song: I’m gonna ask him in terms of sourcing, if sg companies will be interested in the list of products. What other info is needed. Etc. anything else you want me to ask?
[10/6/22, 6:03:11 PM] Gary Teh: Items not on this list would be helpful 

We can use that as more directions for sourcing 

I know @19514467219 contact Liza also has a relatively large inventory 🙂
[10/6/22, 6:04:38 PM] Gary Teh: Also figure out what his kpi 

I wonder if it might be possible to rope him in to this network 🤔
[10/6/22, 7:00:55 PM] Vincent Song: Ok got it.
[10/6/22, 9:52:52 PM] Betty: I just viewed this, though I put a call already to some persons at the port for exporting more details will be shared on that, I also have the contacted a friend of mine who gets most of these from his farm, but I've been hospitalized since Sunday tho I feel better but I'll make sure to follow up on this today
[10/6/22, 9:56:13 PM] Satheesh Paddolker: ‎You removed Satheesh Paddolker
[10/6/22, 9:55:56 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! Please take care Betty. 

Thanks for following up with handling the details for exports. Also once @6598622082 comes back with more details on more information we might need, please do follow up with your friends. Let's try to fill up the google sheet with as much details as possible to facilitate the exporting of product out of Africa. 🙂

By the way, @255659580499 is a practicing doctor. I wonder if he might be able to help you with your condition.
[10/6/22, 10:04:10 PM] Murtaza: Happy to help, just PM

[10/15/22, 12:04:36 PM] Gary Teh: Folks @6598622082 asked me these two questions pertaining to the trade routes we are trying to setup into Singapore from Africa. I thought to share them here too.
[10/15/22, 12:10:39 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/15/22, 12:12:45 PM] Gary Teh: How can a win-win situation be established between Singapore and Africa:
--------

Singapore imports the bulk of its food supplies from overseas. The supply chain shock experienced during the pandemic has shown that we need to shore up our food security. Right now there are efforts to further increase the volume of home grown food production. A complementary approach to this effort would be to increase the number of trading partners for food supplies. This will provide further insurance for our food security in case any food supplies from any existing trading partner gets disrupted. 

From the micro-perspective, Africa is a remote and foreign location that most Singaporeans are firstly not familiar with (often considered dangerous no thanks to Hollywood propaganda) and not really motivated to go explore and seek out partnerships opportunities. 

Our trading network serves as a trusted channel where  companies in Singapore hoping to source for new supplies from trading partners in this region can tap on.

ESG (Singapore) can help by engaging in a win-win partnership by directing keen Singapore companies to join this trading network.
[10/15/22, 12:14:42 PM] Gary Teh: @971561302188  would you like to start a Google doc and add these two sections I just shared into it? This will serve as the start of EcoVerse21 white paper. 🙂
[10/15/22, 12:17:58 PM] Gary Teh: What we are trying to do
--------

Africa after decades of foreign aid from the West still does not have the necessary infrastructure in place to float their own economy. The main bottleneck right now is firstly lack of financing availability for locals to start their businesses and secondly lack of job opportunities for locals to gain capital through work. 

Right now, China is trying to aid the development of this region through the belt road initiative. This does not alleviate the above described bottleneck. Bulk of these Chinese loans are channelled back to Chinese construction companies never passing through the hands of locals, while local governments are left saddled with expensive debt which they cannot finance. The subsequent defaults lead to commandeering of built infrastructure by Chinese authorities. Meanwhile, Chinese money is pouring in with the goal of buying out resource rich patches of land from the locals who lack the capital to develop it themselves.

While there is a current Web3 trend which aims to alleviate the economic situation via Play To Earn models, this is ultimately unsustainable as long term solutions as there is no concrete and sound fundamental economics backing these. Bulk of them are driven by the mania that the NFTs associated with the Play to Earn games will keep increasing over time. Price trends observed over the past year has proven otherwise. Total population of full time employed Play to Earn workers the world over has fallen by around 90% year to date.

When we take a step back to examine the full picture, Africa is rich in natural resources and generates a lot of foreign revenue through these exports. In the mid to long term, China will increasingly rely on Africa for its food supplies while Western Europe will increasingly rely on Africa for its own energy supplies. Right now bulk of the margin is kept profit by the middle men. Given the increasing observed reliance and profit margin, this presents an opportunity for us to establish an alternate trade route to channel resources through. 

When we take into account the aging population problem that is happening right now in most industrialized nations, it becomes imperative we start building up the economy and education system of areas of the world where next generations youthful work force will be coming from. Africa is one of this regions where a substantial portion of the population is still youthful.

This goal of this alternate set of trade routes is to redirect surplus generated back to these African communities to power the financing of new business thereby creating new jobs opportunities. The end goal is a self sustaining eco-system that is no longer at the mercy of external entities which can foster our next generation of global work force

Let me go chat with them to see if they might be keen to sample some of our coffee beans
[10/15/22, 2:02:02 PM] Gary Teh: We might be able to setup a trade route for coffee to the entire west coast of the US to these boutique small scale coffee roasteries if there is demand 🤔
[10/15/22, 11:26:38 PM] Betty: Sure I can do that,

[10/25/22, 7:47:56 AM] Gary Teh: Folks just finished our chat with Habib, friend of @6598622082, who works for the ESG committee in Singapore 

Habib will be helping make a bunch of introductions to the various trade associations where we can find buyers 

We learned from him that various buyers will have their own set Quality control needs. This is something we will need to look into and ensure integrity when we start conducting the exports of out Africa since that is the most problems portion of this entire operation. Failing to do so properly will get our entire network of suppliers blacklisted 😢

Also he will be sharing a list of trade conventions that we should establish a presence in to source for more buyers 

Meanwhile while we wait, we should source for more farmer friends in our network that we can help generate sales volume for. 🙂🙏
[10/25/22, 7:49:31 AM] Gary Teh: I have also shared our inventory list with Habib to better facilitate the introductions he will be making

For now let’s just focus on match the supply and the demand
[12/18/22, 12:57:17 PM] Peter Peng: Alibaba of Africa is what we need
[12/18/22, 12:57:28 PM] Peter Peng: Does such a thing exist?
[12/18/22, 1:04:54 PM] Gary Teh: Alibaba is coming into Africa and there is also a local platform 

Rather than trying to build the platform directly which is very capital intensive let’s just focus on setting up a few trade routes that we could immediately generate revenue and further bootstrap our network

[12/18/22, 1:54:53 PM] Gary Teh: Hey @41765737357 happy to see if we could direct source from Africa some of the materials you are right now using in your products 🙂🙏
[12/18/22, 1:55:50 PM] Gary Teh: @971561302188 is based in Nigeria 

@254729080961 is based in Kenya 

@255659580499 is based on Tanzania
[12/18/22, 2:07:23 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Thank you @14153000019 I am glad to have found some ingredients for my cosmetics in africa, fair traded and organic, what makes me very grateful at the first place. But I don’t think this is enough. The supply chain is not perfectly transparent. I wish to know where my karitée is being hatvested and who is taking care of the soil. In my certification (cradle to cradle certified gold) it is quite difficult to change suppliers, but I can always upgrade to the better. Biodynamic agriculture for example. Since I am only buying small amounts, I am very dependent on my distributors, but I hope to chance that asap. Happy to follow your chat here.
[12/18/22, 3:47:48 PM] Gary Teh: We already have some stuff sourced 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbbrDWe-LhxEPTBCJQQoiIGy-3uffZaGu0KWu7PZBWs/edit

Happy to source for more Ingredients that you need for your products 

What are some ingredients that you are currently sourcing from Africa
[12/18/22, 11:34:55 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: It is Shea butter and Passifloraseedoil. But in order to include it to my list, it would need some certifications. Bio/organic/natrue/cosmos. I wonder, if we could give prove of invitonment safe and ethical sourcing using technology. What do you have in mind for this?
[12/19/22, 6:08:10 AM] Gary Teh: I think of two options 

- source for a certification authority to provide the certification 

- come up with our own auditing process and then do the issue (we need to get into the QC anyways)
[12/19/22, 6:09:34 AM] Gary Teh: I believe @41799155602 made a introduction earlier on to someone knowledgeable about QC. We could start investigating into that with him
[12/19/22, 6:27:10 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I guess that would be needed. Keeping the control. But that is basically what makes the Project a bit of work. Taking random certifications might not include small and fair business and that is, what I believe something to change. It should be easy to excess, affordable and transparent.
[12/19/22, 6:34:37 AM] Peter Peng: This screams blockchain and smart contracts
[12/19/22, 7:15:10 AM] Gary Teh: Yes and yes to what @41765737357 and @14075792560 are suggesting 

Let’s me check with Anita to see if liquid legal would be familiar with the certification side then we can setup the blockchain side to handle the notarization on chain mechanism

Hi Gary - I'm not familiar with obtaining a letter of credit.

On the certification side - Off the top of my head, the "Environmental Working Group" has been around since the 90s advocating for the ethical treatment of workers and consumer transparency. They are one of the most popular certs in the health & beauty realms

[12/19/22, 11:36:29 AM] Gary Teh: I foresee it being used for notarization in the initial application 

Later on when the network gains more critical mass and blockchain becomes more prevalent in the wider population we could handle the transactions on chain 

Think of it as a version of Alibaba where the merchants and the buyers themselves also own the platform

It’s the wholesale center for all things Gem in the US!! 🤩

[12/19/22, 1:18:46 PM] Gary Teh: Seems the case. Unfortunately got kicked out, they thought I was writing the prices on my phone when I was trying to figure out what was the gem mentioned in one of the books
[12/19/22, 1:39:28 PM] Gary Teh: I guess it might make sense to go to the bazaar a few streets down to check out what those folks have instead
[12/19/22, 8:00:09 PM] Gary Teh: Sourcing the shea butter right now in Nigeria

And the passifloralseed oil from Ghana right now

Should get a revert soon 

I am assuming your distributor based in Switzerland was handling the importing paper works? 🙂
[12/19/22, 11:38:55 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I am going through different suppliers. In France and Germany. Swiss are just Subsuppliers. It is very complicated. From my Passiflora, I don’t have the exact origin! Cosmetic industries are used to work very intransparent. It is changing slowly. And the labels @41791555798 mentioned are known in the food sector, I have not done a propper research to find out how they work. I do have only one supplier in Germany that I trust entirely. They have a very few row materials, but are in contact with the source. Taking personally care for each step and handling it very well. These guys might even be interested to use such a system once it is working. They did, but I like, and went all around an existing system. Very personal and transparent. I love new technologies and would like to have sexy, easy solutions for the future. Keeping the personal approach, but macking it accessible to many. Being able to include smaller independent producers. As I wrote before, keeping the cost affordable. So the money goes to the soil rather than getting taken by all processes in between before getting to the costumer. But a verification system is necessary in order to keep the transparency, and the quality high. Yes, the distributors provide us with all product data sheets and thake care the products are trsted for whatever they need to be tested by law.
[12/19/22, 11:40:39 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: tested
[12/20/22, 12:01:15 AM] Anita Lamprecht: Hello @41765737357, what about setting up a call and we discuss what you would need and have done so far. This way it would be more efficient for me to start a proper research on the certifications. There are quite a lot of certifications e.g. for natural  cosmetics (just made a quick google research and found this overview for example https://www.ecco-verde.ch/de-CH/themen/zertifikate) and I think finding one that works both in Switzerland and the EU would be great.  Is this your homepage: https://www.karinlanz.ch? Please let me know, when you are available for a call (if you like). Thank you. Anita (I speak German)
[12/20/22, 12:02:43 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Yes, my personal one. The brand is https://lanur.swiss

Should something firm up in the meantime and we don’t have a Swiss CooP setup for our legal wrapping yet, We will be utilize the TrueTech Inc, US Delaware corp as our OffChain entity 

@16468233438 has kindly offered to renew the registration for that legal entity for this forthcoming year. Should amount to USD450.

The amount he paid for the renewal will be issued out to him in terms of shares in TrueTech Inc at USD1 per share. 

The same amount of governance tokens will be issued by TrueSight DAO to TrueTech Inc to be included as part of its holdings. 

So for every share issued out of TrueTech Inc, it will have a corresponding holding of TrueSight DAO Governance tokens

[2/4/23, 3:40:04 AM] Gary Teh: It occurred to me if we might be able to award governance tokens to incentivize the shipping of samples and storage of produce? 🤔
[2/4/23, 3:45:13 AM] Gary Teh: Here are the full list of produce we have sourced for so far within this network 🙂🙏

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YbbrDWe-LhxEPTBCJQQoiIGy-3uffZaGu0KWu7PZBWs/edit


@254729080961 has managed to hel source for Coffee supplies in Kenya 

And since we have a list of purchasing agents here in the list you provided we might have hit jackpot regarding matching supplies and demand. 🤩

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1ShLiC64Mm0eqyohk9BujwE1g0_8rXITM/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msexcel

 I guess the next thing is to tokenize the making of cold calls to the purchasing agents too

That way once goods pass through EcoVerse21 from the suppliers to the buyers all the folks in the middle who have contributed to the linking up of the supply chain will end up getting remunerated via appreciation of token value 🤩
[2/4/23, 4:09:38 AM] Anupa/diya: This has to be researched in detail because normally shipping is done via DHL or FedEx via bussiness accounts.
The storage of any produce for wholesale is a huge expense since they have to be kept in temp controlled environments and other details.

It might be good to have an incentive attached or some kind of tokenomics 

As there is a powerplay and corruption in this bussiness, governance tokens have to be awarded to people with the right ethos or  a set of principles of Dao guidelines should be imposed
[2/4/23, 4:31:04 AM] Betty: This document doesn't open, kindly give view access.
[2/4/23, 4:34:16 AM] Anupa/diya: Done
[2/4/23, 4:37:24 AM] Betty: Great, thanks 👍
[2/4/23, 5:14:19 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Now that the two dynamos are linked up I believe the engine is going to start churning 🤩
[2/9/23, 11:50:56 AM] Gary Teh: I was wondering if we should just focus on coffee beans during our initial iteration? 

Thoughts?
[2/9/23, 12:07:27 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I have friends who roast and sell coffee directly from the farm here in zurich. Don’t know from where, but if anyone needs a contact
[2/9/23, 12:20:53 PM] Gary Teh: That would be wonderful! 🤩

Could you help make the introduction?
[2/9/23, 12:34:19 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: i left a message. almost on my way to argentina to check my own supply chain. btw when are you back in BA?  Not before 25?
[2/9/23, 12:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: I think we will have just missed each other. My ship arrives at port on the morning of the 26th. 🤣
[2/9/23, 12:43:24 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect overlapping it seems. I am sure I will see you again in Zurich the next time I pop by in Europe.
[2/9/23, 12:43:53 PM] Gary Teh: For the coffee beans, if needed, we could arrange to have some samples shipped over. 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 12:44:07 PM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Plane leaving 25th 🙈
[2/9/23, 2:13:40 PM] Gary Teh: Our movements are so perfectly in sync we are running parallel 🤣
[2/9/23, 5:58:03 PM] Anupa/diya: If we look at coffee beans, then our target market would be roasters like Karin mentioned or buyers who sell to roasters. Coffee beans are normally washed or unwashed at this point and can't be indirectly used for commercial use.

There are companies who sell coffee beans kits so the consumer can self grade, self wash, self roast, self grind, and then make. Which might be cool
[2/9/23, 5:59:36 PM] Anupa/diya: If we can find coffee farmers who have access to units  roasting in their some county. Tts easier
[2/9/23, 5:59:59 PM] Anupa/diya: I have a roaster s list somewhere. Let me look for it
[2/9/23, 6:02:10 PM] Anupa/diya: Coffee might be a good place to start because like the oriental tea service. In Ethiopia, coffee has its own coffee ceremony
[2/9/23, 6:05:52 PM] Anupa/diya: Called Addaa Buna. Buna is coffee 
Apparently Eritrea has their own ceremony has well

He knows of folks in souther America who supply coffee beans as well 🙂🙏
[2/9/23, 7:56:26 PM] Gary Teh: Yup. It definitely feels just focusing on one commodity (coffee bean in this case) helps focus our attention for this project as well as accelerate the compounding of network effects 🤩

[2/11/23, 8:21:48 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @14153000019 
Hello :)

Here it is.
[2/11/23, 3:13:22 PM] Tres Garcia: ‎Tres Garcia left
[2/12/23, 6:40:01 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes sure .. can do .

If we are looking at coffee ..

We will need to narrow down on which is the user group are we planning to start with

If the farmer of any produce is the focal point.. that would be quite revolutionary depending on the country 

If we are looking at the roaster, then our journey would be different 



If we Start with
[2/13/23, 4:28:02 AM] Gary Teh: Could you elaborate on both? 🙂
[2/13/23, 7:56:34 AM] Anupa/diya: If we are looking at product fit to the service 

We need to identify 
1. What is the problem area or the area of opportunity we are trying to address
2. Who are the people 
3. What is the ecosystem or service system  are they in now
4. What are the gaps and challenges they face 

We might have an solution in mind but how do you cater it to the user group

Depending on the user group, we can tailor our web 3 context not solution to the actual scenario to build the most probable outcome.
[2/13/23, 8:01:37 AM] Anupa/diya: In an project like that, one will  have to factor natural resources + energy + climate , currency and global/national exchanges, physical storage, trading, regulations, human capacity + dynamics, time, geographic location, cultural and ethnographic backgrounds and rituals
[2/13/23, 8:01:50 AM] Anupa/diya: Please feel to add to this
[2/13/23, 9:22:16 AM] Gary Teh: Based on what we have learned so far from @971561302188, Tushar (who had left the room), Tres (who has left the room), Aga (not in the room) these are the following assumptions about the sell side

Statement 1) African producers are not able to secure fair price for their produce

Statement 2) middle men are imposing unfair prices when procuring these goods from them 

Statement 3) middlemen are artificially restricting supplies to keep prices elevated on the consumer side 

Statement 4) it is challenging to acquire certification to become eligible for exports to buyer destination 


Based on what we know from @41765737357 these are what we have learned from the buy side

Statement A) buyers on the European side are concerned with whether the processes used to grow these produce are environmentally friendly (not specific to coffee though. Needs to be proven this problem exist for coffee)

My hunch is if there is actually a problem to be solved after validation, it would make sense to go for it. Otherwise this project will end up heading in the direction of Cypher defense (aka the graveyard 🤔🤣)
[2/13/23, 9:27:43 AM] Anupa/diya: Just to add to statement  A .. Process authentication, licenses, pricing and transportation
[2/13/23, 9:29:07 AM] Anupa/diya: If the middle man can be limited and the farmers can directly trade with a buyer, that's beyond fabulous. Web 3 can do that, thats real change. It has a direct impact on the economy
[2/13/23, 9:30:01 AM] Gary Teh: Are these processes currently handled by the middle men?
[2/13/23, 9:30:41 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I can corroborate on the seller side issues.
[2/13/23, 9:32:08 AM] Anupa/diya: For what I have seen, the farmers need grading resources, storage plants, transport and mostly the centralized systems fix the price
[2/13/23, 9:32:36 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I had built a platform for this in 2019 and the greatest challenge was onboarding farmers.

Back then, they preferred having everything abstracted.

Also, you'll find that how fast the exchange happens matters a lot. Which is something middlemen capitalize on.
[2/13/23, 9:45:03 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes thats very true, the exchange movement is rapid. 

For my experience, onboarding is not easy at all as well  the grass root level adoption has to be very very solid and efficient. However, farmers also have a phone and someone of the family can use it. They do have daily meet ups for conversation exchange and are driven by social community change. 

Yet again, what kind of farmers are we looking .. they vary from single generation family to small and medium scale businesses. In person interaction is key for something like this.

Farming is almost political driven by most countries. That's another thing 

If we choose a rooster, then we will have to see where are they located. Many farmers don't have close access to roasters, it's either in a different city or even country.
[2/15/23, 3:43:31 AM] Gary Teh: Simple rules we abide by in this space 

1) When coming to a fork in the road and in doubt  get a majority vote 

2) when realize no one has any idea of a missing piece find more people to join that are willing to contribute missing piece 

Both actions awards you with governance token grants 🙂👍
[2/15/23, 3:46:43 AM] Gary Teh: Freely exercise your autonomy 🤩
[2/15/23, 3:47:18 AM] Anupa/diya: 🤣🤣 i believe in  community voices in most cases.
[2/15/23, 3:47:51 AM] Anupa/diya: As a group it will be a good idea to see which route we want to take as a first mission.
[2/15/23, 3:48:41 AM] Gary Teh: Want to create a poll? 🙂
[2/15/23, 3:48:46 AM] Anupa/diya: Which is the market produce we would like to look into. 

Is it small scale or wholesale  or what kind of categories
[2/15/23, 3:49:07 AM] Anupa/diya: I was thinking. To start with maybe we can actually start a conversation on slack
‎[2/15/23, 3:49:24 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[2/15/23, 3:49:28 AM] Anupa/diya: So we can have the conversation recorded and not bombarding the group
[2/15/23, 3:49:40 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes I have the option
[2/15/23, 3:49:41 AM] Gary Teh: Dropout rate is usually around 100% 🤣
[2/15/23, 3:49:51 AM] Anupa/diya: 🤣🤣🤣
[2/15/23, 3:50:15 AM] Gary Teh: We tried the same with telegram and discord 

Drop out rate is the same 

Can’t teach a horse new tricks 🤣
[2/15/23, 3:50:35 AM] Anupa/diya: I think it is imperative for people within the group to do some research before we go ahead
[2/15/23, 3:50:53 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes you can. You need to be a smarter teacher 🤣
[2/15/23, 3:51:50 AM] Gary Teh: I believe some people are more talented as teachers 

Unfortunately that is not my profile. I defer to stronger profiles in that department 🤩
[2/15/23, 3:52:25 AM] Anupa/diya: We can do a poll
[2/15/23, 3:54:35 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎POLL:
Do we need to individually research. If yes, please look into the agro market, gaps and challenges. Pick a produce of your choice and look into the supply chain. If  No, then should we look at the info given in the group.

And then tokenize for successfully bringing these coffee buyers into the network??

[3/14/23, 8:22:46 AM] Anupa/diya: Hi everyone!
[3/14/23, 8:22:57 AM] Anupa/diya: Ecoverse has taken a new turn
[3/14/23, 8:23:19 AM] Anupa/diya: I propose a very short and quick workshop as we are all super busy with time.
[3/14/23, 8:24:16 AM] Anupa/diya: I urge the people who are or know about commodity transaction like buying and selling to drop in.
[3/14/23, 8:26:13 AM] Gary Teh: Yes please! 🤩
[3/14/23, 8:28:12 AM] Anupa/diya: We are looking at building a service for the commodity market and we have found a product fit for it
[3/14/23, 8:28:30 AM] Anupa/diya: We need some kind of initial testing.
[3/14/23, 8:29:19 AM] Anupa/diya: If you can suggest potential people who could aid the conversation (doesn't have to be a part of the DAO) that will be great
[3/14/23, 8:30:24 AM] Francois renet: Can you clarify?
[3/14/23, 8:31:28 AM] Gary Teh: @41765737357 would be great to get your inputs as well
[3/14/23, 8:34:38 AM] Anupa/diya: Pricing is a huge area of opportunity or challenge for the produce market
[3/14/23, 8:36:42 AM] Anupa/diya: Find the right price for the buyer or the seller is a task. In most faces, it is third party dependant and eliminates the seller from the decision making
[3/14/23, 8:36:52 AM] Francois renet: I meant how will the service be presented? As an app?
[3/14/23, 8:37:41 AM] Anupa/diya: Well in most cases, that's the most feasible representation
[3/14/23, 8:39:45 AM] Anupa/diya: However, I see to pre-empt a solution at the beginning might negate a great outcome 

The aim of this quick workshop just look at the current scenarios of pricing exchange and visibility. What are the thoughts of buyers and sellers on pricing.
[3/14/23, 8:41:09 AM] Anupa/diya: Tomas, Gary and myself have been in conversation. I would like to open it up to the group cause there is no decentralized pricing service for agro community as per my knowledge
[3/14/23, 8:41:49 AM] Anupa/diya: This has great potential to bring the voice the sellers to the stage and that would be a game changer. Who knows
[3/14/23, 8:43:21 AM] Gary Teh: 🙂👍🏻
[3/14/23, 9:02:56 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: that reminds me that i did not hear back from my coffee friend 😬
[3/14/23, 9:22:42 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes Karin ! It would be great to have you in the chat
[3/14/23, 9:23:23 AM] Anupa/diya: @19514467219 since you have engaged in the post activity. I hope you see you at the session
[3/14/23, 9:29:15 AM] Francois renet: When is the session?
[3/14/23, 9:30:04 AM] Anupa/diya: Well we can have a vote on a suitable timing

[3/21/23, 9:19:45 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Thank you too.

My apologies for not showing my face. I was in transit.
[3/21/23, 9:20:09 AM] Gary Teh: No worries. It was valuable contribution you made nevertheless 🙂👍
[3/21/23, 9:26:48 AM] Anupa/diya: Great insights !
[3/21/23, 9:26:54 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: please have a look at this as a technical ‘solution’. this is what I like as a buyer.
[3/21/23, 9:27:22 AM] Anupa/diya: I will set up a whiteboard online tool which we can add inputs
[3/21/23, 9:27:27 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: great pleasure to meet you all
[3/21/23, 9:28:35 AM] Anupa/diya: It would be good to have like some similar conversations of gaps and challenges with other buyers and producers which maybe we can carry out independently and feedback to the group
[3/21/23, 3:37:41 PM] Suhaimi QuantEdge: ‎Suhaimi QuantEdge left
[3/21/23, 6:49:12 PM] Gary Teh: Always happy to see you 🙂🙏
[3/21/23, 6:54:54 PM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to your leadership in this initiative 🤩
[3/21/23, 7:22:01 PM] Anupa/diya: Nice try 🤣 ! Everyone s in it
[3/22/23, 3:21:12 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys! I was thinking about the aggregation platform, and then to Karin’s comments, and how she purchases some of her products from large corporations’ surplus. 

Are you guys familiar with the Queen of Raw? She set up something similar for textiles. Manufacturers can resell their surplus of textiles and other manufacturers can buy them. It’s a sustainability play in as far as we are using unused resources versus polluting by creating more. 

Perhaps a similar system could be set up for other commodities/products?

I also believe that reaching out to certifiers to get a list of the companies they have certified could help cut through the noise. 

Just my Wednesday morning 5 cent ideas!
[3/22/23, 7:01:27 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: An other 5 cent: in terms of working with agricultural products in the circular way a platform could be cross industry. Lanolin comes from wool. We use one sent extracted from sugar cane waste that smells like patchouli…
[3/22/23, 7:01:50 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Ok, that just didn’t narrow it down 😅
[3/22/23, 7:07:14 AM] Francois renet: This is great @41765737357! Dream big or go home!
[3/22/23, 7:07:34 AM] Francois renet: Built the right way with the right people this could be huge!
[3/22/23, 7:07:53 AM] Francois renet: Add scientists and product developers to the mix and BANG!
[3/22/23, 7:08:55 AM] Francois renet: Actually, if you could come up with a couple of ideas of how textiles/wool could be repurposed, I am happy to speak to the Queen and see if we could piggy back off of her platform!!
[3/22/23, 7:13:23 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Well, what is spinning in my head right now would be a platform for side streams. So, first onboarding ‘bigger’ players (already certified and on the market) to trade their side products. Then hook smaller farmers and nitch products…
[3/22/23, 7:14:37 AM] Francois renet: How do we get to these people?
[3/22/23, 7:14:55 AM] Francois renet: Or do we build a skeleton platform first and then invite them?
[3/22/23, 7:25:44 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: before building, we might need some market research. if waste of our resources is the biggest problem of our time, this might be the point to start. only high quality producers are at this moment aware of side streams, because their products are so valuable, you would not want to waste any of it. then again these guys must already have been thinking about solutions …
[3/22/23, 7:41:36 AM] Francois renet: You’d be surprised how much people with blinders @41765737357! The lack of imagination and vision is baffling!
[3/22/23, 7:51:20 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes this is imperative for us to look at the key stakeholders and then pin point on our user group along with the viability.. we can also build a persona... which is a representation of the potential user dea we trying to solve the problem 

What is our area that we are trying to solve or what is the area of opportunity we are trying to build on
[3/22/23, 7:52:02 AM] Anupa/diya: I agree ! Go big or go home !
[3/22/23, 7:53:57 AM] Francois renet: I think the areas are multiple. But perhaps we start by trying to solve the roadblocks/opportunities for members of the group such as @41765737357 ?
[3/22/23, 7:57:18 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes I will set up the miro board which I suggested yesterday so we can continue the brainstorming there to see what is feasible 

We can have 3 areas 

Opportunities ... gaps and challenges... these can be insights by us and research... can be quantitative data..

It will be easier to see the feasibility and viability as well
[3/22/23, 7:59:11 AM] Francois renet: @14153000019! We always come back to the first conversation we ever had my brother. It’s all about creating THE network of trust, purpose and execution!
‎[3/22/23, 8:00:04 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[3/22/23, 9:11:26 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: well, I am not sure, if this is what ecoverse21 is about but if you want me to go crazy and throw some of my innovations ideas in: I would love to safe the shells of carefully sourced oysters from luxury hotels, to extract matting powder for cosmetic products. I believe in taking what we have, use streams that already exist, give it an extra value and then work back the supply chain and have an impact on the sourcing (environmental and social)
‎[3/22/23, 9:14:19 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎image omitted
[3/22/23, 9:16:46 AM] Francois renet: This is great! What it boils down to is creating value. Value for whomever picks up the oyster shells from the restaurants. Supply chain to get them to powder. What is the process? What is required to do with the shells to make them usable?
[3/22/23, 9:25:55 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: I have not looked into it yet. When I started looking for the mating powder I could only find it from perls somewhere in the south east pacific and it sounded like very far away no control and like a waste. i stopped the development process because of not satisfying solutions, but I thought by myself, I should open a side business and starting to trade resources. opening side streams. i wanted to safe this for later. 😊
[3/22/23, 9:31:30 AM] Francois renet: Hi! I’m Later. Nice to meet you @41765737357 ! 😂

[3/22/23, 6:32:52 PM] Anupa/diya: Thank you ! Val ! This will be great!

[3/23/23, 9:35:29 AM] Anupa/diya: https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/7-projects-using-web3-to-support-smallholder-farmers
[3/23/23, 9:42:38 AM] Anupa/diya: I quite liked the concept of Hara where farmers are connected to resources like banks and insurance companies etc

Just a thought.. farmers are always looking to find the right resources whether at a production to selling level  

If we are saying that we shouldn't eliminate stakeholders from the ecosystem, maybe we can create better accessibility and availability to resources. 

This can probably also built other chains of transaction between other skateboarders.
[3/23/23, 9:42:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Skateholders
[3/23/23, 11:24:40 AM] Gary Teh: I believe to focus our attention and efforts, we should shortlist a maximum of 2-3 models we want to test and then vote on one that we will focus our full attention on just validating it

Divergent thinking is good for the variant generation phase, however continued loitering on the divergent phase will just cause enthusiasm and corresponding energy to become dissipated in an undirected fashion. Once the dissipation is done, there will be no more energy left to actually power the business model
[3/23/23, 11:26:11 AM] Gary Teh: Simple analogy, we filled up the car with a full tank of gas. Then we press on the pedal without engaging the gear

The engine spins but the wheels don’t move

After a few hours we have burned up all the gas and the car remains on the same spot the whole time🤔
[3/23/23, 11:29:03 AM] Anupa/diya: If we have a process system for phases like discover define develop delivery ..then we can evaluate what goes into what phase
[3/23/23, 11:29:47 AM] Gary Teh: You are the specialist for design thinking.

Are you past the discover phase yet? 

If not, what is missing? 🙂
[3/23/23, 11:30:34 AM] Anupa/diya: We are just in the discover phase .. I am not a big fan of the double diamond.. it's the easiest to explain.
[3/23/23, 11:31:15 AM] Gary Teh: What are the next steps needed for the discover phase in this project??
[3/23/23, 11:31:31 AM] Anupa/diya: I will add it in the miro.
[3/23/23, 11:31:42 AM] Gary Teh: Perfect! 🤩
[3/23/23, 11:59:52 AM] Tomas - Offchain: @918017107841 is there a miro link already to input some thoughts?
[3/23/23, 12:00:20 PM] Tomas - Offchain: I'm a little lost in 50 ws groups
[3/23/23, 12:00:28 PM] Tomas - Offchain: 🥲
[3/23/23, 12:00:35 PM] Anupa/diya: I am just emailing Val as we speak !
[3/23/23, 1:59:21 PM] Tomas - Offchain: 💪
[3/25/23, 4:34:32 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 you mentioned there was a specific use case in the agriculture producer space that you were very passionate about? 

Want to share it with our group? 

From my perspective, since we operate as a DAO, makes a lot of sense to perhaps focus our attention on projects that at least a few people feel very passionate about than on projects where most members just feel slightly interested about
[3/25/23, 4:37:54 PM] Gary Teh: In traditional startup projects progress relies heavily on availability of VC funding, For DAO projects progress relies heavily on member passion and engagement 

The progress of Dan’s Artist build community project is a case in point.

[3/27/23, 7:38:17 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Beware of non original things
[3/27/23, 7:43:12 AM] Gary Teh: I love OEM stuff

I was a importer and exporter of OEM originated from southeast and east Asia back in 2004 when eBay first came to Singapore
[3/27/23, 7:44:27 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Jajaja
[3/27/23, 7:44:40 AM] Tomas - Offchain: Then you know your stuff
[3/27/23, 7:44:42 AM] Gary Teh: Too bad, we did not stick with the business model or further build upon it but pivoted away. 

E-commerce became really huge in Southeast Asia 5 years after we shifted away from the sector into other sectors. All the major e-commerce players you see in that field came into being around 2010

Once again, we were too early 🤣
[3/27/23, 8:26:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Hi Everyone ! Busy Monday!
[3/27/23, 8:42:48 AM] Anupa/diya: From my experience, the pool of small scale producers raw and semi processed are highly underpresented due to the intermediaries. Empowering and mobilizing such communities is a huge task but if it can be done, it can scalable in many different countries.

As there is a huge socio political cultural component in agriculture, there is a large potential for investment. 

However, any project that we decide to do. 

 we has to have 
1. A Strong purpose. What are we trying to solve and why. It has to connect with the principles of Trusight.. equality diversity inclusivity(Gary? 🤣) 

2. Who are the people in the ecosystem 

3. What is the scope, bussiness model 
Analyze the market,customer and science trends future trends 
How will it work and is it working .mvp . Prioritize on top 2 to 3 areas for ideation 
Create _ build_ prototype 
What is the ROI
Validate for market delivery.

How does it work with Tru Sight model 
And etc 

As I see the two main areas 
That could be explored are
1. Producer as the key consumer 
2. Middle men. The certificate providers or the exchanges or cooperative.

Or if there are any more areas.

If we further brainstorm on how we can go forward. If we can settle on a meeting date maybe next week end
[3/27/23, 8:44:44 AM] Anupa/diya: I think we can also take a call on the level of engagement or roles.

If we are really going forward. Maybe we need to open up the project to other people for resources or even list it on the website 

Open for bussiness 🤣
[3/27/23, 8:46:56 AM] Anupa/diya: It will great if define at what point this can be a social experiment to an actual viable project
[3/27/23, 9:13:57 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, the transition from a social experiment to a viable project is when we have figured out a viable business model that all participants are receptive towards
[3/27/23, 9:15:01 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a car as an analogy, until we have figured out the blueprint of a car design that works, everything before that point is just ideation
[3/27/23, 9:20:04 AM] Anupa/diya: Let's say .. do we only apply for investment funds or do we also aim like at research grants for smaller milestones 

Since these projects will be working on a grass root level  . Who ever it is, producer or intermediary, we will have to show qualitative research to show and test the viability
[3/27/23, 9:28:22 AM] Anupa/diya: I will be exporting this chat into a document so we don't lose out on the comments said by everyone
[3/27/23, 9:33:30 AM] Gary Teh: At the early stage, I believe research grants will be more viable

I am not at all familiar with how impact funds operate, perhaps Alessandro might be able to advice
[3/27/23, 9:42:23 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I agree. Most investors would like to see the MVP first.
[3/27/23, 9:44:20 AM] Anupa/diya: @254700187599 if we need to speak to producers for a workshop .. would you know anyone who is willingly
[3/27/23, 9:44:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Or even @971561302188
[3/27/23, 9:45:13 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yes.
[3/27/23, 9:47:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Fab ! If yiu could make a list for the data base.

We can collectively create a database of the various stakeholders.. farmers.. intermediaries..we could potentially speak to

[3/27/23, 10:22:15 AM] Anupa/diya: We can select as a group the potential actions for the ledgers and make a token list for ecoverse
[3/27/23, 10:27:24 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, the active participants within this group should have an exercise to do this 🙂👍
[3/27/23, 10:37:23 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Ooh😄
Thanks!
[3/27/23, 10:40:25 AM] Gary Teh: Don’t thank me. It is the system you should thank 🙂👍

I am just pointing out the feature of the system

Based on the current issued governance tokens to USDT in reserve (approximately USDT0.004 per token), it’s equates to USD1 per lead generated 

This amount will either go up or down based on how successful our ongoing efforts to getting to a monetizable model
[3/27/23, 10:52:49 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Great!

[4/2/23, 7:25:03 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 want to share more about the Cacao supply you found in here South America? 

I am right now in Brazil and hanging out with @554792591729

I will be headed over to Columbia in a few weeks time. I believe @5491125130580 might be doing the same too

@5491125130580 is flying from Buenos Aires to meet up with me in Florianopolis tomorrow 

I believe Martin who caters for House of Balance in Davos Switzerland utilizes cacao from this region

This might be an interesting trade route to explore

He did reach out earlier about raising funds to acquire a cacao farm here in Brazil last month. Haven’t heard back from him since when I asked for more information on the financial side 🤔
[4/2/23, 7:28:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Hi Gary and tru dao, so I have been traveling in Sierra Nevada where I have been studying cacao and writing about it.  My medium article will be live in a few days and I will start to discuss this.
[4/2/23, 7:29:03 AM] Tess walkowski: I ended up staying with a Kogi family, deep in the mountains where native cacao grows
[4/2/23, 7:30:11 AM] Tess walkowski: They have a harvest coming up, and I would like to buy half if it, and sell this cacao which helps them, and over time we move to a larger farm and help the community get land back.

[4/2/23, 7:31:46 AM] Gary Teh: What you propose is perfectly aligned with our use case for EcoVerse21 

Helping find buyers for agricultural produce for small producers in developing countries so as to help channel funds back to these communities to build up their facilities
[4/2/23, 7:32:37 AM] Tess walkowski: They could really use solar power , and long long rolls of  pex plus crimpers and tools
[4/2/23, 7:32:52 AM] Gary Teh: How long will you be there for? And which part of South America and you in? 

I will pop by on my way up north 

Let’s take a look at the facility you are describing while I am there 🙂

Also how much is the per unit cost of the cacao harvest?
[4/2/23, 7:33:08 AM] Tess walkowski: When do you arrive
‎[4/2/23, 7:34:29 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/2/23, 7:34:37 AM] Gary Teh: Via leticia
[4/2/23, 7:34:38 AM] Anupa/diya: @13134136108 this is excellent! Thanks for sharing your research. Your real time insights would be great
[4/2/23, 7:34:41 AM] Tess walkowski: I will sell for the highest market price is USA and European markets
[4/2/23, 7:35:23 AM] Anupa/diya: You will get a list of  insight mapping requirements. 🤣
[4/2/23, 7:35:50 AM] Tess walkowski: I am in Sierra Nevada
[4/2/23, 7:36:08 AM] Gary Teh: @554792591729‘a family has extensive knowledge in Civil engineering. They would be great advisors to the Green upgrades you are mentioning about 🙂👍
[4/2/23, 7:36:09 AM] Tess walkowski: Right now in palomino
[4/2/23, 7:36:27 AM] Gary Teh: Could you share a link via google maps? 🙂
[4/2/23, 7:37:07 AM] Gary Teh: The location of the farm? 🙂
[4/2/23, 7:38:59 AM] Tess walkowski: The farm is up from Rio ancho
[4/2/23, 7:39:15 AM] Tess walkowski: It's a heavy hike the harvest is in early May
[4/2/23, 7:39:51 AM] Tess walkowski: You would need to come with supplies and payment to visit the farm as it is closed a bit to outsiders
[4/2/23, 7:39:57 AM] Gary Teh: Actually pertaining to what @41765737357 proposed about helping bring the surface the stories of how producers utilize sustainable cultivation methods, it might be helpful to conduct an interview with them. 

I know that @554792591729 has been thinking of doing such a filming series 

Also I wonder if the @19514467219 art talk magazine series might be interested to cover this 🤔
[4/2/23, 7:40:07 AM] Tess walkowski: They have nothing and do not use money ....
[4/2/23, 7:40:21 AM] Gary Teh: What sort of supplies and payment? 🙂

[4/2/23, 7:41:48 AM] Gary Teh: Cool! How long are you going to be in Columbia?
[4/2/23, 7:42:02 AM] Tess walkowski: Till this harvest is done at least
[4/2/23, 7:42:17 AM] Tess walkowski: I will be in this region still but I don't know what city
[4/2/23, 7:42:40 AM] Tess walkowski: Around here minca / bonda / Rio anci / palomino
[4/2/23, 7:42:54 AM] Tess walkowski: Prob end of may early June
[4/2/23, 7:43:12 AM] Gary Teh: So it’s going to be in four weeks? 

The timing seems quite convenient 

Let me try to meet up with Amir whom I met on my cruise to Antartica 

He is a financier based half the time in Columbia
[4/2/23, 7:44:10 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s see if we can put something interesting together to both benefit the local community as well as our TrueSight community 🙂
[4/2/23, 7:44:40 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes I am working with other people too and have many contacts
[4/2/23, 7:45:33 AM] Tess walkowski: This one came up yesterday when I realized my research brought me up a remote mountain to a community which has not come down for 500 years
[4/2/23, 7:45:56 AM] Gary Teh: Mainly on the supply side or the demand side as well?

@918017107841 had a lot of experience with the import and export trades out of Africa 

I am aware that @554792591729’s family has experience with how farms operate here in South America. So does @5511982667030 for larger scale farms
[4/2/23, 7:46:04 AM] Tess walkowski: It's delicate, because they are indigenous in this case.  However that is also the correct way.
[4/2/23, 7:46:29 AM] Gary Teh: That is the circular way to do things ☯️
[4/2/23, 7:46:46 AM] Gary Teh: Chat soon. Heading for my ayuhuasca ceremony now 🤩
[4/2/23, 7:46:48 AM] Tess walkowski: We could aim to get a farm here or buy land and then hire them to help us process at fair wages double national day pay
[4/2/23, 7:46:55 AM] Tess walkowski: Is it your first
[4/2/23, 7:47:20 AM] Tess walkowski: I mean hey Gary, maybe we are meant to be putting mayo buddies
[4/2/23, 7:47:39 AM] Tess walkowski: If you are with the tribes please say hi and bring me some rapeh :).
[4/2/23, 7:48:13 AM] Tess walkowski: I just did my kambo initiation
[4/2/23, 7:51:13 AM] Gary Teh: Yes!!
[4/2/23, 7:55:54 AM] Tess walkowski: Where are you now
[4/2/23, 7:56:07 AM] Tess walkowski: Good luck. Are you doing two?

[4/2/23, 8:10:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Just did kambo initiation
[4/2/23, 8:11:05 AM] Tess walkowski: I work with other medicines cacao is coming up in the discussion bc it is powerful.
[4/2/23, 8:29:05 AM] Gary Teh: That seems to be a theme as well during Davos this year. That was why Martin got so into cacao too
[4/2/23, 9:36:25 AM] Tess walkowski: I mean Gary even before you go up I want you to try what I make it's stellar.
[4/2/23, 9:37:23 AM] Tess walkowski: I will presell this cacao at $55 lb if anyone wants to reserve and my resulting set of hearts made with this is also $55 pre reserve
[4/2/23, 9:37:46 AM] Tess walkowski: It made me cry the first time and hit like medicinal mushrooms
[4/2/23, 9:38:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Since then I set out to learn more!
[4/2/23, 9:38:12 AM] Tess walkowski: And know why
[4/2/23, 10:42:52 AM] Tess walkowski: But if anyone can help me microfund first round I need about $1000- $2000

[4/2/23, 5:26:33 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s discuss and clarify the terms for financing as well as recourse in case of exceptional event 

Just brought in @6598383264 who is very experienced with international deal structuring from this more than 20 years of experience in Private Equity 

I am right now doing an audit of our receipts from subscriptions revenue generated by Edgar (our resident AI)

As of now our DAO USDT5000 that could be readily deployed. 

Tentatively that amount should increase by another USd1000. The exact number will be known once I am done doing the audit

Once we have clarified the terms of financing, let’s submit this as a proposal for the entire DAO to vote on 🙂👍
[4/2/23, 5:28:03 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/2/23, 5:29:49 PM] Gary Teh: The way I see it, if this is minimal viable transaction works out, our DAO can explore acquisition of farm In South America

As @5511982667030 suggested operating farms will require their own set of logistics

@554792591729 has kindly offered to go visit some of the farms they have on the Brazilian side near the borders of Bolivia. Would be great to go study and understand the operations if we do decide to proceed to phase 2 (acquisition of farm)
[4/2/23, 5:32:11 PM] Gary Teh: @381644913030 will need your guidance on how our governance model can support this incoming transaction 

By the way @381644913030 has came up with this wonderful governance framework which dictates how our DAO’s funds and governance token will be managed 🙂🙏

[4/2/23, 8:41:18 PM] Gary Teh: Regarding the financing terms I believe it is important we keep in mind the triple bottom line

1 - ensure you @13134136108 make enough so that you can continue your endeavor 

2 - ensure enough goes back to the Colombian community so that they can building their infrastructure to further improve upon their quality of life

3 - ensure enough comes back to our DAO so that we can continue expanding support to more transactions that fit the triple bottom line criteria
[4/3/23, 7:20:54 AM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.
[4/3/23, 7:24:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Let's discuss financing.  This situation is a small opportunity where we can test with less risk.
[4/3/23, 7:25:03 AM] Tess walkowski: It is contingent on the cacao being told, and this is a VERY special cacao not commercially available
[4/3/23, 7:26:23 AM] Tess walkowski: I have many research threads going on but when I tried this cacaco.  I make my own products with it, which are superfood ball, they will be hearts
[4/3/23, 7:26:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Nutrient dense, this is a ceremonial food.
[4/3/23, 7:27:47 AM] Tess walkowski: My research has taken me deep.  I finished an initiation in kambo with a mambo, who is amazing and also is indigenous and has been going tribe to tribe

[4/3/23, 7:30:20 AM] Tess walkowski: This story sells, they are three brothers with a few more brothers on this side of the hill, they want food sovereignty and to preserve their culture and THEY WANT THEIR LAND
[4/3/23, 7:30:54 AM] Tess walkowski: So as we dream future, we would buy them land down the mountain, and make a cacao facility there
[4/3/23, 7:31:45 AM] Tess walkowski: If you tasted this ....
[4/3/23, 7:38:06 AM] Gary Teh: How many pounds of cacao would our potential investment yield? 

Also is there a buyer list already assembled 

There might be opportunity to utilize DAO member help to assemble the list. Effort can be considered sweat equity investment and remunerated via our governance tokens 🙂👍
[4/3/23, 7:46:02 AM] Tess walkowski: Gary, when you come, I can show you also the arhuaca chocolate facility.
[4/3/23, 7:46:38 AM] Tess walkowski: I think we should meet mid coast a few days near don Diego or quebrada Valencia
[4/3/23, 7:47:39 AM] Tess walkowski: This harvest is small, maybe 200-300 lb
[4/3/23, 7:48:24 AM] Tess walkowski: We can use this model, work on relationships, and develop forward with this family and others
[4/3/23, 7:49:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Goal over time eco co-working space for medicine and culture for non natives and as our base
[4/3/23, 7:49:47 AM] Tess walkowski: And land back for them.   Then we would buy cacao acherage in both Brazil and Colombia.
[4/3/23, 7:49:56 AM] Tess walkowski: My articles discuss why.
[4/3/23, 7:50:33 AM] Tess walkowski: We also have access to rapeh in Brazil and Colombia and other amazing products
[4/3/23, 7:50:48 AM] Tess walkowski: But cacao opens the heart, it tells a story
[4/3/23, 7:51:35 AM] Tess walkowski: I am bootstrapped.  I write copy take pictures. Think. But I also deeply believe in value.
[4/3/23, 7:52:03 AM] Tess walkowski: Doing work in both.  Brazil. Colombia.
[4/3/23, 7:52:46 AM] Tess walkowski: A product receiving place in USA.   We could use dao as a model for a use case for change.
[4/3/23, 8:21:22 AM] Gary Teh: Perfect let’s do that
[4/3/23, 12:27:32 PM] Tess walkowski: Mini meet, my budget is bootstrapped but it's good. Palomino is also a good spot, it's semi remote, no ATMs and about 1.5 hours from Santa Marta airport
[4/3/23, 12:27:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I do guide type stuff if you need any type of experience
[4/4/23, 9:49:21 AM] Tess walkowski: I could only drop in for a minute today have to move from  my hotel room
[4/4/23, 11:34:16 AM] Tess walkowski: We should jump on a 15 if you think you will make it to the region and look for somewhere to stay.
[4/4/23, 11:34:25 AM] Tess walkowski: Hard to find the perfect place
[4/4/23, 11:37:35 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s discuss when we meet in Columbia 🙂👍

From my perspective, in relationship to our DAO, it ties back to our core value of Diversity 

In this case, firstly preserving ecosystem diversity by providing a balance against the further spread of large scale monoculture farming practices 

Secondly Channeling resources back to the village so that they can continue preserving their way of life. This serves to retain cultural diversity in the general ecosystem
[4/6/23, 8:01:16 AM] Anupa/diya: Hello Everyone ! Just reviving our main agenda of the ecoverse
[4/6/23, 8:01:49 AM] Anupa/diya: As we have the bussiness canvas model now, can we collectively start adding the thoughts we had during our call
[4/6/23, 8:02:13 AM] Anupa/diya: Maybe we can schedule after Easter
[4/6/23, 8:04:34 AM] Anupa/diya: Some of the main points 

1. Looking at the supply chain and distribution 
2.certification on the blockchain 
3. Intermediaries 
4. Farmer accessibility to larger markets 

Phygital service that can work across global spaces that will benefit the agro stakeholders 

We can identify the key user.

[4/6/23, 8:17:35 AM] Gary Teh: Seems to me there are three potential business models emerging in this chatroom

1. DAO becoming a financier in this space 
 
2. DAO becoming a logistic provider in this space 

3. DAO becoming a farming operator in this space

I wonder which business model we should focus on when we go about filling up our dedicated business model canvas. Thoughts?
[4/6/23, 8:19:16 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 2
[4/6/23, 8:19:34 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 1
[4/6/23, 8:20:00 AM] Gary Teh: This is business model variant 3
[4/6/23, 8:22:48 AM] Anupa/diya: It all depends on the key user and the purpose. Farmer (what kind) intermediaries or the service providers 

Logistics would be great because accessibility is a huge issue 

Grading plants or Grading digitized systems .
[4/6/23, 8:24:46 AM] Gary Teh: How shall we go about deciding which key user should we focus on?
[4/6/23, 8:27:11 AM] Anupa/diya: Research. Qualitative and quantitative... there has to be a strong validation of why we choose the user. 

What is this problem we are trying to solve .
What are the gaps and challenges 
Everyone had some great points last call
[4/6/23, 8:30:29 AM] Anupa/diya: If we can find a way of doing some ground work research that will be great. @254700187599 @971561302188  can we please look into that if possible .
[4/6/23, 8:32:45 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just lump all we have in mind on to the canvas 

I am sure the ideal user will start surfacing as we start seeing where all the gaps are as the collective insights are inserted 

From my perspective there are the three fits

Team Market fit - social capital
Team Product fit - human capital 
Product Maket fit 

Team in this case is our community 

No point attempting to solve a problem if 

1) no one in our community is familiar with the problem 

2) no one in our community has access to people who are experiencing the problem

3) no one in our community knows how to solve the problem
[4/6/23, 8:32:50 AM] Aléksa: Helloi 

Are you looking to acquire a farm?
[4/6/23, 8:34:09 AM] Gary Teh: The immediate context is  exploring how to provide financing to a distributor (@13134136108) looking to procure 50% of an indigenous farms harvest
[4/6/23, 8:35:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Later after organic dao structure is stronger and trust built via smaller contracts, future a farm but that's complicated
[4/6/23, 8:36:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Great points above.  I will write an article about use case for daos soon, focus on farming. Finishing the details on some background articles for cacao to educate users as well.
[4/6/23, 8:36:58 AM] Tess walkowski: This is exciting and glad to be a part
[4/6/23, 8:37:50 AM] Anupa/diya: We currently looking at a collective  purpose that will help us address the key issues at the agro tech community 

We are at the research stage so any insight will be very helpful!!
[4/6/23, 8:38:53 AM] Tess walkowski: I can share my research Ux ui for crowd dao but I want to be a little private if I share research.
[4/6/23, 8:38:59 AM] Tess walkowski: Cow dao
[4/6/23, 8:39:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Dao farm
[4/6/23, 8:39:43 AM] Tess walkowski: Does this group have a Canva/figma. I see many visions and great ideas in this group
[4/6/23, 8:40:49 AM] Gary Teh: This one was setup yesterday 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/canvas
[4/6/23, 8:43:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Whatever is comfortable for you as the research will be open to the community
[4/6/23, 9:11:11 AM] Aléksa: that depends  on many factors, it's a  bit difficult to say anything based on this
[4/6/23, 9:12:03 AM] Gary Teh: What are some factors that immediately comes to mind?
[4/6/23, 9:37:42 AM] Aléksa: how will the funding be given 
to whom 
from who 
what would be the deal
[4/6/23, 9:51:35 AM] Gary Teh: That is what needs to be explored

Angle 1)

Off the top of my head, funding provided by DAO to either 1) distributors or 2) [small scale farm] farmers  seeking for financing to facilitate buying and selling, growing of agriculture produce

In exchange for financing, the DAO gets a percentage of returns that is generated once the off chain transaction is completed. 

Two types of off chain transactions

    - 1) farmer sold off the goods to distributor 
    - 2) distributor sold off the goods to end buyer
[4/6/23, 9:53:17 AM] Gary Teh: Angle 2) funding from external investor that is past to DAO for a limited period of time to facilitate the underlying transaction described above 

Once the off chain transaction is completed, external investor gets his principle back and some profits 

DAO retains some percentage of the returns for facilitating the transaction
[4/6/23, 10:09:46 AM] Anupa/diya: Angle outcome... is it for global farming community of certain produce like coffee or wheat or specific
[4/6/23, 10:11:57 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective looking at the community market fit perspective, it’s really which market (type of farmers/distributors) our community has access to 

The DAO in this case plays a more passive role, it’s not the deal maker but the deal taker
[4/6/23, 10:14:15 AM] Anupa/diya: If we had some perspective of Australia and South East Asia would also be good
[4/6/23, 10:14:25 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/6/23, 10:15:02 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Will do.
[4/6/23, 10:15:51 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/6/23, 10:16:52 AM] Gary Teh: Another way to phrase it

I see we have a DAO (community of people)

I see there is a market

I am thinking what is the easiest way our DAO can establish a foothold in that market and profit from it in a sustainable manner to both the local community and the environment
[4/6/23, 10:18:03 AM] Gary Teh: If there is no way our DAO can establish a foothold in that market, then all our discussions and research conducted here within this space will just at best remain theoretical
[4/7/23, 7:01:19 AM] Aléksa: In order for the DAO to invest, needs to have a legal entity, be KYC/AML compliant, need to have a contract. 

Depending on the legal status of the farm, it can be okay, or can be a securities problem as you're investing because you expect some return. 

In addition to that, depending on the jurisdiction, you might need to be an accredited investor to make this type of investment. 

I dont understand fully angle #2.
[4/7/23, 7:12:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I think this type provides a good test use case for making a dao function.
[4/7/23, 7:13:47 AM] Tess walkowski: .....in this example....it's a family who needs farming supplies ....
[4/7/23, 7:14:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Money is less important to them that preserving their culture and taking care of their community
[4/7/23, 7:15:01 AM] Tess walkowski: ....let's say this works ....
[4/7/23, 7:15:41 AM] Tess walkowski: There is another thing which happens as this evolves....
[4/7/23, 7:16:07 AM] Tess walkowski: Does the dao put a stamp of approval on my cacao for example
[4/7/23, 7:16:58 AM] Tess walkowski: It's ethical.   There are two other companies who came up in my research.  And they changed the world.
[4/7/23, 7:17:51 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao beans were once considered so valuable they were used for currency
[4/7/23, 7:24:30 AM] Anupa/diya: Well most buyers need recognized certifications. The blockchain can be used for authentication and Traceability
[4/7/23, 7:24:39 AM] Tess walkowski: I will use your worksheet
[4/7/23, 7:24:45 AM] Anupa/diya: As a support
[4/7/23, 7:24:59 AM] Anupa/diya: In the past we have focused on coffee as well.
[4/7/23, 7:25:02 AM] Tess walkowski: This comes in time..... And that's a bit the issue honestly
[4/7/23, 7:25:16 AM] Tess walkowski: There is a monopoly in food
[4/7/23, 7:25:37 AM] Tess walkowski: The control means a few major companies have the world's supply.
[4/7/23, 7:25:39 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: This would be an issue for small scale individual farms in africa.
[4/7/23, 7:25:45 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee is another example
[4/7/23, 7:25:53 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes and it's a problem!!!!
[4/7/23, 7:26:07 AM] Tess walkowski: First off coffee is native to Africa not here
[4/7/23, 7:26:42 AM] Tess walkowski: It is a serious issue bc it means people don't get food sovereignty
[4/7/23, 7:27:01 AM] Anupa/diya: We haven't really looked at a specific produce that we will be targeting
[4/7/23, 7:27:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee and cacao are dry and easier
[4/7/23, 7:27:24 AM] Tess walkowski: Produce ....whoa
[4/7/23, 7:27:34 AM] Tess walkowski: Be a superhero take that on
[4/7/23, 7:27:34 AM] Anupa/diya: So that's where the solution comes in how can be build a solution that looks into local adoption.
[4/7/23, 7:27:45 AM] Tess walkowski: That Dao could save the world
[4/7/23, 7:27:59 AM] Anupa/diya: We will have to do pilots first
[4/7/23, 7:28:30 AM] Tess walkowski: ....from cacao to bananas it's a whole ...just wow....
[4/7/23, 7:28:59 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I think that would be great.

What we have is farmers associations that get certifications for farmers under them. They also get to contribute in inspecting farms and quality assurance.
[4/7/23, 7:29:01 AM] Tess walkowski: Absolutely small things where trust is built, but also where the contracts of the dao are build
[4/7/23, 7:29:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Where are you?
[4/7/23, 7:29:19 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Kenya.

[4/7/23, 7:30:47 AM] Tess walkowski: I love raw milk
[4/7/23, 7:31:01 AM] Tess walkowski: Raw milk is close to illegal where I am from
[4/7/23, 7:31:29 AM] Tess walkowski: I am writing though about Africa would love to chat more and learn about your country
[4/7/23, 7:31:31 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Sure. Look it up.
Our best produce is tea. Then coffee which is used for blending.

We are now the largest producers of avocado and macadamia in africa.

A lot of flower exportation among other things.

And wambugu apples😄
[4/7/23, 7:32:21 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: That would be lovely. You can dm me whenever.
[4/7/23, 7:34:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I will! My research is going to take me around the world.
[4/7/23, 7:34:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I am writing about Africa. It's powerful.  So I will need to learn African history
[4/7/23, 7:36:03 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: That's cool. I'd love to help.
[4/7/23, 7:36:43 AM] Tess walkowski: Sure!  I have 40-50 pages of research now
[4/7/23, 7:36:51 AM] Tess walkowski: It's an issue that is global
[4/7/23, 7:40:53 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yes it is. 

I am right here if you need help. There's a series of books called the lost crops of africa. They might be of great use.

All the best😊
[4/7/23, 10:03:51 AM] Gary Teh: 1) When you mention KYC/AML compliant do you mean for all the token holders?
[4/7/23, 10:05:24 AM] Aléksa: no, of the entity, the DAO
[4/7/23, 10:06:55 AM] Gary Teh: Any recommendations on the country to incorporate if it’s to cater to financing needs of this Colombian farm?
[4/7/23, 10:07:09 AM] Gary Teh: How do we do that?
[4/7/23, 10:08:50 AM] Gary Teh: Regarding the farm, which legal status will it cause us to have a securities problem?
[4/7/23, 10:09:26 AM] Gary Teh: Do you mean jurisdiction of the farm? Or jurisdiction where we incorporate the EcoVerse21 entity?
[4/7/23, 11:08:42 AM] Gary Teh: I just completed my subscription for ChatGpt using GPT4.

This is my question

“What is the most suitable legal structure for a DAO that handles import and export of agricultural produce if I want to incorporate in Switzerland?”

This is its answer 

If you want to incorporate a DAO in Switzerland to handle the import and export of agricultural produce, the most suitable legal structure will depend on various factors, including the size of the organization, the level of liability protection you require, and the governance structure of the DAO.

Here are three possible legal structures for a DAO that handles the import and export of agricultural produce in Switzerland:

1. Limited Liability Company (LLC): An LLC is a popular legal structure for a DAO as it provides limited liability protection to its members while allowing them to participate in the management of the organization. An LLC also offers flexibility in its organizational structure, as members can elect a board of directors or manage the organization themselves.

2. Cooperative: A cooperative is another legal structure that is popular for DAOs in Switzerland. It allows members to join together to pursue a common economic goal, in this case, the import and export of agricultural produce. Members typically have equal voting rights, and profits are distributed among members based on their contribution to the cooperative.

3. Association: An association is a legal structure that is commonly used to incorporate non-profit organizations in Switzerland. It is suitable for a DAO that aims to promote a social cause, such as sustainable agriculture. Associations have a democratic organizational structure with a board of directors elected by the members. Profit-making activities are limited, but an association can generate income from the sale of goods or services related to the organization's purpose.

It is crucial to seek legal advice to determine the most suitable legal structure for your DAO based on your specific requirements and objectives.

[4/7/23, 11:11:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I just learned I can't ship out
[4/7/23, 11:13:51 AM] Vlatko Gigov: that can be easily done through a business introducers agreement through a rev share. Check out unit.network model of having to deposit collateral in order to be creditworthy for next rounds of financing or business opportunity…
[4/7/23, 11:14:01 AM] Gary Teh: Was just consulting ChatGpt the same.

My question

“What is the most suitable organization type to choose when incorporating a DAO in Switzerland, if the goal is to handle import and exports of agricultural produce from South America and Africa to Europe? 

If we are expecting the size of our organization to be more than 10000 members in the future and they are spread around the world?”

It’s answer 

“If you are planning to incorporate a DAO in Switzerland with the goal of handling import and exports of agricultural produce from South America and Africa to Europe, and you are expecting the size of your organization to be more than 10000 members in the future and they are spread around the world, a Cooperative legal structure will be the most suitable organization type. 

Here's why:

1. Democratic governance: The cooperative structure enables a democratic organizational structure, where the members have equal voting rights and participate in the management of the organization. This is crucial in a DAO, where members of the community are the decision-makers and have the power to vote on projects, proposals, and distributions of funds.

2. Limited liability: Members of a Cooperative have limited liability protection, which means they are not personally liable for the DAO's debts or obligations. This protects the members' assets in case of legal actions against the DAO.

3. Economic participation: The Cooperative legal structure promotes economic participation of its members. Members participate in the profits or losses of the DAO based on the amount of contributions they have made to the DAO.

4. Robust legal structure: The Swiss cooperative law has a robust legal structure, which provides regulatory certainty, and facilitates capital-raising and the expansion of the DAO. As a result, a Cooperative can handle complex import and export activities, which require significant capital-raising to purchase and transport large amounts of agricultural produce.

5. Global reach: The cooperative structure can be established internationally, serving its members in different parts of the world. A cooperative can provide services, facilities, and resources to its members regardless of their geographical location.

It is important to seek legal advice when incorporating a DAO in Switzerland to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Additionally, it is essential to have a clear governance framework, operations plan, and community management system to manage a DAO, especially with a large number of members.

[4/7/23, 11:16:04 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: 😄

I have witnessed this with tokenization of real estate too. 

There is no recognition of tokens as legal ownership.
So startups have to form SPVs owned by the token holders. The certificate of title is owned by the SPV and held by a custodian.

As spoken suggested by @5491125130580 a few days ago, and right now kick started by @918017107841 we are assembling a list of grants that we will apply to for liquidity in our DAO

I believe this is a good time to  start figuring out the formal incorporation of our DAO. 

This is also most especially true since our DAO has already started generating revenue from Edgar and once the tokenomics is defined with GetData Inc, revenue from that direction too

It is time to get serious

That property in the desert once acquired needs to go under the ownership of our DAO. So definitely the need to sort out our incorporation needs to be dealt with very soon
[4/7/23, 11:30:39 AM] Gary Teh: So we can either acquire the piece of land in the desert of Arizona/New Mexico or

Or areas in Argentina/Brazil

In both territories we have civil engineering specialists available we can consult with
[4/7/23, 1:15:26 PM] Tomas - Offchain: Probably next week we will have more information on next steps

This is because the supply chain will be very different for coffee, shea butter and cacao 

Makes better sense to just focus on one ☝️
[4/8/23, 6:41:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is my choice for a reason also bc I can sell it.....
[4/8/23, 6:41:30 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee is not native to south America

[4/8/23, 10:15:18 PM] Gary Teh: Was checking with ChatGpt on KYC today to endures today for our DAO and this was what it suggested 

Starting to realize it is quite good for providing options when dealing with policy related matters 

KYC (Know Your Customer) is a process used globally to verify the identity of customers and assess the potential risks of illegal intentions such as money laundering or terrorist financing. KYC is already mandatory for financial institutions and other regulated entities, but it is relatively new in DAOs. Here are some ways that KYC can be performed for DAOs:

1. Verification of personal data: DAOs can require members or participants to provide scanned copies of their IDs or passports, proof of address, social security numbers, or other relevant personal information to meet KYC requirements. For instance, an independent third party can perform the KYC process, such as a digital identity verification platform, a token sale platform, or an exchange.

2. Smart Contract Verification: DAOs can deploy smart contracts that can verify users' identity and make sure that all users comply with the KYC regulations using the principles of self-sovereign identity. This approach requires users to have a digital ID, which consists of their personal data, and sensitive biometrics through the use of blockchain technology.

3. Reputation Verification: Reputation verification involves creating a rating system, where users are rated based on their past transactions and adherence to certain terms and conditions set by the DAO. Although this works slightly differently than traditional KYC, it still enables DAOs to minimize risks by avoiding users with bad reputation scores from joining the DAO.

It is crucial always to seek legal advice from an expert in the field since the regulatory paradigm for DAOs is consistently evolving, and a specific regulator may apply KYC regulations in a unique way. Educating members on KYC best practices through community engagement is also crucial for the DAO community to maintain regulatory compliance.
[4/9/23, 8:29:14 AM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 helped setup a dinner last night with a farm owner. He and his wife set everything up from scratch

One of the key problems he surfaced were that some agricultural produces like tangerine do not have a global commodity price (like for example coffee beans)

As such the prices middle men (what Satheesh call aggregators) quote them and other small scale farmers can be wildly volatile 

I now get a better sense of the problem that @254700187599 and @918017107841 described. As well as the concern that @19514467219 surfaced earlier during our last FaceTime conversation 

There might in fact be demand for an oracle solution as suggested by @918017107841 and @5491125130580
[4/9/23, 8:29:54 AM] Gary Teh: I prompted ChatGpt on the best strategy to build and roll out such a framework. This is its response 


Implementing and rolling out a blockchain-based oracle for agricultural product prices that do not have a commodity market can be a complex and technical task that requires careful planning, execution, and collaboration amongst the DAO members. Here's a strategy that can be employed:

1. Identify Requirements: Define the requirements that the oracle must meet to provide accurate and reliable data. List factors like market demand, product variety, supply factors such as input costs, seasonality, transportation, and storage costs.

2. Explore Existing Tools: Explore existing oracle platforms available in the market that can provide an off-the-shelf solution. Solutions like Chainlink, Band Protocol, Tellor among others can be used with modifications.

3. Design Oracle Architecture: Design the oracle's architecture that aligns with the requirements identified in step one, either by modifying the existing platforms or by building a new one. Using smart contracts to automate the workflow and data inputs can improve reliability and the robustness of the oracle.

4. Develop the Oracle: Developers can build and test the oracle based on the requirements set in step 1.

5. Pilot Study: Conduct a pilot study on a small scale to test the effectiveness of the oracle in providing reliable and accurate data.

6. Deploy and Monitor: Deploy the oracle on a large scale and monitor its effectiveness to ensure that it meets the expected requirements. Apart from active monitoring, regular feedback from users can help improve the oracle.

7. Marketing and Outreach: Promote the use of the oracle with stakeholders who can provide value from its use, such as those in agro-production, agro-insurance, government agencies or digital marketplaces. Active collaboration with stakeholders in the agricultural value chain is also critical.

8. Regular Maintenance and Upgrades: Regular maintenance must be conducted oracles to identify issues, resolve errors, and update the oracle's performance, reliability, and accuracy.

In summary, rolling out a blockchain-based oracle for agricultural product prices requires a systematic approach, a technically sound development team, and an experienced advisory team. The use of existing solutions, smart contracts, feedback from users, and stakeholder collaboration can contribute to the success of the oracle. Finally, a well-established maintenance schedule will help maintain performance and reliability over time.
[4/9/23, 8:31:33 AM] Tess walkowski: It's a long story Gary, a story which topples empires and effects politics..... The fluctuation in price causes farmers to lose all, and the history of colonializing involves monoculture things like Suger

[4/9/23, 8:45:21 AM] Gary Teh: Great inputs will add that to my reading list
[4/9/23, 8:46:24 AM] Tess walkowski: There are major major issues in produce that are revolutionary to address
[4/9/23, 8:46:32 AM] Gary Teh: @5491125130580 and @918017107841 pertaining to the roles required for this project of which the initial phase is focused on providing such an oracle solution. These are the recommended roles proposed by ChatGpt 

The implementation and rollout of a blockchain-based oracle for agriculture product prices that do not have a commodity market can require the following roles:

1. Project Manager: Coordinates the different activities involved in the project, communicates with the project team and DAO members, and ensures timeliness and the successful execution of project milestones.

2. Technical Lead: The person responsible for designing the oracle architecture and leading technical development activities.

3. Smart Contract Developer: Develops the smart contracts that will manage the data submitted to, and extracted from, the blockchain-based oracle.

4. Data Architect: Responsible for designing the metadata format for the data that will be recorded on the blockchain.

5. Blockchain Developer: Builds and integrates the blockchain-based oracle into the eventual platform for its use by stakeholders.

6. Quality Assurance Analyst: Implement quality control procedures, identifying issues and resolving them, and verifying that oracle results are accurate and consistent.

7. Outreach Coordinator: Responsible for coordinating promotion activities, which include pitching the oracle to potential users, writing and pitching guest posts, and engaging with those who could benefit from the new system.

8. Data Analyst: Analyze and optimize data to the maximum benefit of the interested parties.

9. Agriculture Expert: Those with experience in agriculture that can provide insights regarding the most important data points to record and how to present the data best.

10. Marketing Expert: The person responsible for designing and executing effective marketing campaigns for the resulting data.

The defined roles above are examples but will differ depending on the DAO's capacity, requirements, and goals. Coordination and communication among the roles are essential for the efficient functioning of the blockchain-based oracle. Each team member should have an excellent understanding of the scope of the work and how to accomplish it to ensure the project's overall success.

[4/9/23, 9:17:09 AM] Tess walkowski: Run agile with User research and meet in person that helps quick
[4/9/23, 9:17:14 AM] Anupa/diya: It's all great ! But we need an idea before that 🤣🤣
[4/9/23, 9:17:26 AM] Tess walkowski: 0
[4/9/23, 9:22:00 AM] Anupa/diya: Pricing is one of the key issues. This is an area which can attract producers at any level in any country with any produce. 

I wonder if this is a "narrative" that would attract the investors easily rather than concentrating on particular produce and country. 

With the pricing with can also look into @19514467219 idea of the certification
[4/9/23, 9:56:12 AM] Gary Teh: Prompt ChatGpt for that? Its seems to have a lot of content. 

What it lacks is the ability to execute the narratives, plans and strategy in the real world. That is where I believe humans are a nice complement.
[4/10/23, 8:50:29 PM] Gary Teh: Prompt to ChatGpt.

Our DAO’s purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good process to acquire and onboard small scale farmers to our DAO’s onchain oracle for agricultural product?
[4/10/23, 8:50:49 PM] Gary Teh: Response 

To acquire and onboard small scale farmers to our DAO's onchain oracle for agricultural products, a good process that could be followed is:

1. Identifying and Mapping farmers: Conduct a survey of small-scale farmers in the area or region of the DAO's presence and categorize them based on different factors like location, types of produce, and other details relevant to the DAO's goals.

2. Define Membership Criteria: Establish criteria for farmers to be eligible for onboarding, including the use of sustainable farming practices, compliance with local regulations, and willingness to share necessary data, such as planting and harvest times, yield volume, and others.

3. Set up an application process: Create an application process, where farmers can apply by submitting their farm's details, farming practices, and willingness to share data with our DAO.

4. Validate and verify data: On verification, farmers' details can be uploaded to our DAO's on-chain oracle, creating a decentralized and immutable record of their farming practices.

5. Farmer Education: Educate farmers on how to use the on-chain oracle and the importance of sharing accurate data while also understanding the rewards of the platform.

6. Provision of incentives: To attract farmers and ensure their consistent participation, provide some incentives to farmers, such as seed capital for farming, supply chain access, and contract discounts. 

7. Create network for farmers: Facilitate a network of small-scale farmers who are part of DAO to collaborate, learn from each other, and benefit from best practices shared in the network.

By following these steps, our DAO can create a curated and transparent on-chain record of small-scale farmers who are dedicated to best farming practices in the region, promoting the 'verifiable truth' of the DAO. It also ensures the integrity of the supply chain, supports farm communities, and encourages the development of sustainable farming practices. Additionally, this process addresses the centralization of power in the agriculture industry and supports local small-scale farmers, upholding our DAO's values of autonomy, integrity, and diversity towards building a better world based on fundamental truth.
[4/10/23, 8:52:27 PM] Tess walkowski: I like that. And I like how it's wide net and about more farms
[4/10/23, 8:52:38 PM] Gary Teh: Prompt to ChatGpt

Our DAO’s purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is a good process to monetize our DAO’s onchain oracle which provides agricultural product pricing data from small scale farmers?
[4/10/23, 8:52:51 PM] Gary Teh: Response 

To monetize our DAO's on-chain oracle, which provides agricultural product pricing data from small-scale farmers, a good process could be:

1. Determine the Market: Conduct research and gather insights on the target market that requires the pricing data, such as food companies, retailers, local cooperatives, and other cooperatives.

2. Define Data Inputs: Establish the data inputs required, ensuring they are accurate, standardized, and easily accessible.

3. Create A Subscription Based Service: Create a subscription-based service with different pricing tiers for different levels of data access to our DAO's oracle. 

4. Marketing and Sales: Develop marketing and sales strategies to raise awareness of our DAO's on-chain oracle's price data offerings.

5. Partnerships: Seek partnerships with food companies, retailers, cooperatives and other organizations who may benefit from our on-chain oracle's price data.

6. Develop Tools: Create tools to integrate our on-chain oracle's price data, making it easy for business partners to access the data.

7. Payment Methods: Provide payment methods for business partners, including stable coins or other digital assets compatible with the blockchain protocol.

By implementing these steps, our DAO can monetize the data generated by our on-chain oracle, creating a new revenue stream for the DAO while also helping small-scale farmers receive honest payment for their produce. It also supports businesses transparency in their pricing, protecting end-users' interests and saving the administrative costs of sourcing quality produce. In addition, this process aligns with your DAO's values of verifiable truth, autonomy, integrity, and diversity, creating a more equitable and fair agricultural ecosystem.
[4/10/23, 8:53:41 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean it's a dream.
[4/10/23, 8:55:16 PM] Gary Teh: Our DAO’s purpose is to build a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity.

What is the best geographical location to focus on for building our DAO’s onchain oracle for small scale farmers agriculture produce pricing data? Answer in less than 100 words
[4/10/23, 8:55:23 PM] Gary Teh: The best geographic location for our DAO's on-chain oracle for small-scale farmers agriculture produce pricing data would be a region or country that has a strong agricultural industry with many small-scale farmers growing various crops, supportive government policies, existing logistics and supply chain infrastructure, suitable climate conditions for farming practices, and cultural appropriateness. Countries such as India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Indonesia have a considerable number of small-scale farmers and emerging tech sectors, thus making them viable locations to focus on building our DAO's on-chain oracle.
[4/10/23, 8:59:27 PM] Gary Teh: @971561302188 and @254700187599 

If what ChatGpt mentioned is true both of you will be playing very critical roles in this project
[4/10/23, 9:20:01 PM] Gary Teh: To bootstrap an oracle for small-scale farmers product pricing data in Kenya and Nigeria, the following steps could be followed:

1. Identify Farmers' Pain Points: First, identify the primary pain points farmers face concerning product pricing, emphasizing transparency and fairness to solicit their buy-in.

2. Define Data Inputs: Define the required data inputs, ensuring they are relevant, accurate, and standardized, setting up a reliable source of information for farmers and other parties involved in the agriculture supply chain.

3. Develop an MVP: Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes the essential features and functionalities for the oracle for small-scale farmers' product pricing data in both countries.

4. Partner with Agricultural Cooperatives: Partner with established agricultural cooperatives representing small-scale farmers to gain easy access to a relevant audience.

5. Establish Trust: Establish trust with farmers and other stakeholders involved in the agriculture supply chain, emphasizing regular interaction with key players to guarantee fair and accurate pricing data.

6. Engage with Tech Communities: Engage with the tech communities in both countries, innovators, and entrepreneurs to promote awareness of the oracle and invite collaboration to advance technology adoption.

7. Leverage Technology: Leverage technological solutions such as blockchain and smart contracts to automate transactions, improve trustworthiness, accuracy, and the security of the data.

8. Promote Community Building: Promote community building by incentivizing participation by offering rewards and incentives to farmers for sharing their data inventory.

9. Revenue Models: Consider feasible revenue models such as subscription-based services, giving access to premium data inputs or charging a fee based on the transaction value.

By following these steps, it will be possible to establish viable oracles for small-scale farmers' product pricing data in both Kenya and Nigeria. The Oracle will help scale up transparency and fair pricing along the agriculture supply chain, minimizing wastage, and fostering trust among different players, promoting overall growth within the sector.

[4/11/23, 2:07:28 PM] Tess walkowski: Pain points fall under ux research
[4/11/23, 2:08:13 PM] Tess walkowski: We are the research base and we are strong. We have many countries in this group
[4/11/23, 2:09:00 PM] Tess walkowski: See it's like the dao say stay in one country.
[4/11/23, 2:09:51 PM] Tess walkowski: If we intensify the pain point we want to solve.
[4/11/23, 3:06:11 PM] Gary Teh: We are a DAO with the purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity 

How do we bootstrap an oracle solution for agricultural product pricing data of small farmers?

Should we focus on just one small niche first or go after the entire market initially?
[4/11/23, 3:06:22 PM] Gary Teh: To bootstrap an oracle solution for agricultural product pricing data for small farmers, organizations with the purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth could follow the following steps:

1. Identify Farmers' Pain Points: Identify the primary pain points experienced by small-scale farmers concerning product pricing and emphasize the need for transparency and fairness to gain their buy-in.

2. Define Data Inputs and Outputs: Define relevant, accurate, and standardized data inputs, ensuring they are readily available to the small-scale farmers, and define outputs such as real-time price information and price trends.

3. Establish Partnerships with Cooperatives: Establish partnerships with agricultural cooperatives, associations, entities working closely with small-scale farmers, local NGOs and other stakeholders in the agricultural industry to easily access a wide range of farmers and their produce.

4. Develop a Minimum Viable Product: Develop and test a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes several functionalities such as tracking product pricing data, establishing reporting and compliance rules, and defining roles allowed to input and update data.

5. Leverage Technology: Leverage technology using blockchain or smart contracts for secure traceability, transparency, and to establish trust between participants.

6. Establish Data Verification: Develop robust data verification procedures for any data submitted to ensure that it is valid, accurate, and tamper-proof.

7. Focus on User Experience: Focus on the user interface and overall user experience by continually engaging with farmers to ensure that the MVP is intuitive and straightforward to use.

8. Promote Community Building: Promote community building by incentivizing farmers for participating in the oracle and encouraging groups to regularly input data.

9. Evaluate Market Dynamics and Plan for Scalability: Evaluate market dynamics and determine the best course of action concerning focus- starting with a small niche or going after the entire market initially and plan for scalability based on findings. 

Overall, the best approach would depend on the organization's resources, objectives, and market conditions. Starting with a small niche could be a sound strategy for validating the oracle's functionality, building trust with users, and optimizing workflows while keeping operating costs low. Once the MVP is optimized based on user feedback, it can be expanded to other regions and markets. Alternatively, going after the entire market initially could speed up the scale-up process but may require significant resources and infrastructure to meet demand. The organizations should consider all aspects before deciding on the course of action.
[4/11/23, 10:21:28 PM] Johnson Teh: I can share this with my Jap Wagyu proj on this for proj, what is there for the famers then??
[4/12/23, 5:52:40 AM] Tess walkowski: The price is controlled by the  market and the market is controlled by black rock and vanguard
[4/12/23, 5:53:41 AM] Tess walkowski: They literally would drop Suger prices after forcing places to grow Suger and then cripple them.
[4/12/23, 5:55:11 AM] Tess walkowski: Eggs are another great example, no the supply did not go down they used (fake in a way ) news to say all birds have flu....poof an excuse for rise in egg price
[4/12/23, 7:23:43 PM] Gary Teh: I believe it makes sense to focus our attention on what the next actionable step is

Beyond a certain point expending further energy just on feeling indignation at the injustice that has occurred is counter productive 🙂👍

Let’s set a date for this exercise to be completed to be on end of June. If we don’t get any signals of life by then, I personally, as with Cypher defense, will be dropping out from further supporting this project. The rest of the project members can carry on with it if they feel keen 🙂👍

[4/13/23, 7:34:42 AM] Gary Teh: These are some roles already defined by ChatGpt 

Another role that is missing the role of the subject matter expert. People who have experience in part of the supply chain

I see @41765737357 as being one of them since she is on the sourcing and procurement side
[4/13/23, 7:34:45 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't want to be a naysayer in this project.... I think an oracle that verifies prices in amazing.....however I don't think this hits the farmers pain point.   I deal with farmers who are not in the commercial market, and the farmers are not high income.
[4/13/23, 7:35:39 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't think we have zeroed in enough on a pain point to work effective, and what we are looking at is enormous in trying to succeed it
[4/13/23, 7:36:41 AM] Tess walkowski: I think effort would best be spent else where.  I think it would be better to think about a dao as a sales portal.
[4/13/23, 7:36:44 AM] Gary Teh: What is the pain point you are proposing we home in on?
[4/13/23, 7:40:10 AM] Gary Teh: What is the primary function of that sales portal and how does it work?
[4/13/23, 7:40:22 AM] Tess walkowski: The small farmers are not legally allowed to sell.   We use csas to get around the law. And we trade if necessary. (Illegal to buy raw milk can't use money)
[4/13/23, 7:40:41 AM] Tess walkowski: I think we would want to zero in on one product
[4/13/23, 7:40:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Coffee cacao
[4/13/23, 7:41:07 AM] Tess walkowski: And aim to establish global trade networks.
[4/13/23, 7:41:41 AM] Tess walkowski: To get people to buy our products wholesale
[4/13/23, 7:42:12 AM] Tess walkowski: To be effective we would have to enter global trade.  Coffee and cacao can make it across
[4/13/23, 7:42:41 AM] Tess walkowski: The dao vets the farmers and purchases which adhere to the mission of true dao
[4/13/23, 7:43:03 AM] Gary Teh: It is TrueSight DAO by the way
[4/13/23, 7:43:14 AM] Tess walkowski: Sorry missed a word
[4/13/23, 7:43:49 AM] Tess walkowski: But I think we might be over our head in what we would need to succeed in this at this moment
[4/13/23, 7:44:53 AM] Tess walkowski: Dao cacao: fair trade cacao from Brazil / Africa / Colombia etc.  Your purchase supports sustainable farming and the dao grant initiative and bio diversity
[4/13/23, 7:45:15 AM] Gary Teh: Regardless of the situation there is always a next actionable step 

I would propose we do a vote on which route to take
[4/13/23, 7:45:27 AM] Tess walkowski: All farms we work with have been dao certified ( not organic) to ensure commitment to sustainability
[4/13/23, 7:45:45 AM] Tess walkowski: There is a next step. There are many good ideas here.

There are pros and cons for both these solutions
[4/13/23, 9:25:49 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: Doesn’t starting trading actually lead to the other solution?
[4/13/23, 9:26:11 AM] Tess walkowski: Kind of true
[4/13/23, 9:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: That is very true. 

Basically trading as an activity will lead us to figure out more pain points the exist within the entire value chain
[4/13/23, 9:31:29 AM] Tess walkowski: The oracle could help support our use case.
[4/13/23, 9:31:48 AM] Tess walkowski: For example the Oracle could show global pricing and averages.
[4/13/23, 9:32:01 AM] Gary Teh: Makes sense, it will be a small part of the larger solution
[4/13/23, 9:32:46 AM] Gary Teh: We will close out this poll end of next week. But so far seems the majority decision is starting to shape up
[4/13/23, 9:32:53 AM] Tess walkowski: And perhaps the target client who wants this info is the user not farmer
[4/13/23, 9:33:50 AM] Tess walkowski: This point of them being interrelated is important.  So what comes first
[4/13/23, 9:41:38 AM] Gary Teh: As @5511982667030 has suggested and the way I always do things when solving engineering and later product problems, it is necessary to conduct an end to end tracing at least once to know the nuts and bolts of how everything comes together. 

Only then can the tuning and adjusting be proposed and then executed upon

Executing on a single trade is the single best way to get our foot through the door
[4/13/23, 9:42:27 AM] Tess walkowski: Simple. Execute a single trade.  Like this.
[4/13/23, 9:43:31 AM] Tess walkowski: We would learn from this and reable to restructure
[4/13/23, 9:44:20 AM] Tess walkowski: But seeing as the 3 names products were stronger cacao and coffee and Shea and we have multiple countries in this group.
[4/13/23, 9:44:41 AM] Tess walkowski: Is we have many options to research and execute a trade
[4/13/23, 9:45:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Ie cololmbi to Europe  Brazil to USA etc etc
[4/13/23, 9:45:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Use research to decide
[4/13/23, 9:46:03 AM] Karin - no excuses LANUR Davos: For trading you onboard sellers and buyers and you start to collect data.
[4/13/23, 9:52:06 AM] Gary Teh: Our DAO has USDT 7000++ in our treasury more than enough to test a single end to end transaction.

[4/13/23, 6:10:47 PM] Tess walkowski: I think the dao would benefit extremely from doing a single trade to start
[4/13/23, 6:11:01 PM] Tess walkowski: And it sets an example for a dao
[4/13/23, 6:11:21 PM] Tess walkowski: With a very powerful use case.

[4/17/23, 2:20:34 PM] Tess walkowski: It will hit on all food same issues
[4/17/23, 4:44:22 PM] Gary Teh: It’s mainly spending time finding and then reading through regulations. It’s not rocket science 

I remember my military ex-officer who cofounded and sold a startup really spent time reading through all the regulations in Morocco where they wanted to setup a manufacturing plant for their mini-scooters. He was also the one who spent time figuring out how to manufacture and import mini-scooters from China into USA to scale it.

From my perspective, mentally by default delegating all stuff to specialist before even attempting to spend time mentally going through and understanding a process end to end or perhaps even to the extend of rolling up your sleeves and getting hands dirty with it, is just laziness in disguise. 

All the really strong engineers in my network that went on to successfully founding and exiting tech startup all share this same cognitive trait. That mental grit. 

Or as the VP of product described, when I was hunting down the triggers that cause anxiety amongst teachers to get them to convert to become app users, the tenacity that a blood hound exhibits when following the scent of the blood all the to it’s logical conclusion
[4/17/23, 4:48:25 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 By the way Hero who is in the hammock next to me mentioned there is this very famous Japanese cacao hunter who hunts for cacao internationally.

She managed to find some of the best cacaos in Colombia by visiting the tribes seems you might have chanced upon the same source as she did. 

Have you gone ahead to transact with the tribes yet? 

When is harvesting going to being

I was reading up on the cacao supply chain just now. Seems there are quite a few steps between raw cacao and chocolate. Are you bringing in cacao fruits or are you bringing cacao liquor across the border of the US?
[4/17/23, 4:48:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/17/23, 4:49:09 PM] Tess walkowski: I can send some more writings on cacao
[4/17/23, 4:49:19 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes it's complicated.
[4/17/23, 4:49:48 PM] Gary Teh: Which step in the supply chain are you trying to “jack” into??
[4/17/23, 4:49:50 PM] Tess walkowski: This harvest comes after the rain which comes ....in a few days or a week ...
[4/17/23, 4:50:58 PM] Gary Teh: I should be in Columbia leticia by the 25th

I need to fly out of bogota on the 2nd

So I might have a few days in between 

How easy is it to arrange two days in and out of the indigenous camp?
[4/17/23, 4:51:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Honestly, I might not be able to achieve my goals right off the bat
[4/17/23, 4:51:39 PM] Gary Teh: You will either need permits or know someone from the ports to help you get “cleared”
[4/17/23, 4:51:43 PM] Tess walkowski: If you want to come camp with them two nights to learn I can arrange for you or a group
[4/17/23, 4:52:04 PM] Gary Teh: I am just by myself 

Where is the closest airport?
[4/17/23, 4:52:07 PM] Tess walkowski: I will likely have to work with someone a little more established than my friends
[4/17/23, 4:52:28 PM] Tess walkowski: It's hard to get to but it's the experience of a life time
[4/17/23, 4:52:49 PM] Tess walkowski: It's up from a city called rio ancho.
[4/17/23, 4:53:02 PM] Tess walkowski: Santa Marta is the nearest airport.
[4/17/23, 4:53:23 PM] Tess walkowski: I am writing an article about their life style and culture
[4/17/23, 4:53:29 PM] Gary Teh: How many hours does it take to get in?
[4/17/23, 4:53:51 PM] Tess walkowski: 2.5 in cab from Santa
[4/17/23, 4:53:59 PM] Tess walkowski: Going up about two hours
[4/17/23, 4:54:19 PM] Tess walkowski: And money for supplies for the family
[4/17/23, 4:55:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I would solve the issue I have by being patient and going official getting papers which in time means a factory
[4/17/23, 4:56:10 PM] Tess walkowski: There are bigger indigenous producers they would probably be easier to certify.
[4/17/23, 4:56:25 PM] Tess walkowski: But I know I will work with this family.
[4/17/23, 4:56:44 PM] Gary Teh: I see. Not that bad. I thought it would have taken longer. 

I have enough time to spend one night 

Would that work?
[4/17/23, 4:56:50 PM] Tess walkowski: Can mail you some of my writing if anyone is interested.
[4/17/23, 4:57:39 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean one night there is ok, it just is probably hard to expect to get there all the way up
[4/17/23, 4:57:55 PM] Tess walkowski: Do you know your date yet?
[4/17/23, 4:58:32 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah, spend sometime to figure out how to incorporate a company in Colombia 

We will need that legal entity if we want to handle certifications and exporting from property 

I have been checking the same for Brazil this entire afternoon
[4/17/23, 4:59:32 PM] Tess walkowski: And then a 1.5 walkn
[4/17/23, 4:59:42 PM] Tess walkowski: These are the pressing issues
[4/17/23, 4:59:54 PM] Tess walkowski: I am open to work with Brazil as well.
[4/17/23, 5:00:15 PM] Tess walkowski: I feel this is scalable and the same model and issue with cacao applies
[4/17/23, 5:00:41 PM] Tess walkowski: And no cacao is not chocolate, it the step before chocolate liquor
[4/17/23, 5:00:52 PM] Gary Teh: I know the boat takes 7 days to get to Tabatinga. I will need to figure out the proper procedure to cross the borders to leticia 

So I should factor in a day before I fly out of that of leticia upon my arrival at the borders
[4/17/23, 5:01:14 PM] Tess walkowski: It's cocao mass and the cacao butter
[4/17/23, 5:01:23 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware Baha’i region in Brazil produces cacao. Their chocolate taste good
[4/17/23, 5:01:50 PM] Gary Teh: I was there with @5511982667030  back in 2017
[4/17/23, 5:01:55 PM] Tess walkowski: We want to look for criolla and sustainable harvest
[4/17/23, 5:02:09 PM] Gary Teh: What is criolla??
[4/17/23, 5:02:21 PM] Tess walkowski: It's the type of bean
[4/17/23, 5:02:43 PM] Tess walkowski: The origin tree
[4/17/23, 5:02:52 PM] Tess walkowski: Very likely in Brasil too
[4/17/23, 5:03:12 PM] Tess walkowski: Criollas are not in the market .... They make up only 2 percent
[4/17/23, 5:03:49 PM] Gary Teh: I would propose we just focus on one commodity type first initially. Since the paperwork and logistics are vastly different 

Speaking of which… bump on this poll
[4/18/23, 6:06:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Do you have an email?   I can send you the chocolate details and to any one who is interested.
[4/18/23, 6:07:04 AM] Tess walkowski: The second article is in progress, as are the ones about the indigenous but it answers the whys
[4/18/23, 6:17:20 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: I am interested.


mukirimwirigi@gmail.com
[4/18/23, 6:19:11 AM] Tess walkowski: And Gary, if you had only one day in Santa Marta, there are coffee chocolate farms nearby Santa
[4/18/23, 6:19:27 AM] Tess walkowski: More touristy but more far along in the process
[4/18/23, 6:20:03 AM] Tess walkowski: Or visit the other farm at don Diego
[4/18/23, 6:20:33 AM] Tess walkowski: Going up to the family is epic....but I am planning to go up again but need supplies this round

[4/18/23, 6:22:24 AM] Tess walkowski: That's my pain point personal.  How would I help this family? This particular family?
[4/18/23, 6:23:19 AM] Tess walkowski: I see us having to open a chocolate factory
[4/18/23, 6:23:54 AM] Tess walkowski: It's not impossible to import it's that things have to clear customs and papers be filled out.  It's a USDA permit thing
[4/18/23, 6:24:12 AM] Tess walkowski: Which is also why small scale won't work.
[4/18/23, 6:24:52 AM] Tess walkowski: Any of the three stated products, I sell in my small business Shea, coffee cacao
[4/18/23, 9:41:28 AM] Gary Teh: Garyjob@gmail.com
[4/18/23, 9:42:26 AM] Gary Teh: Do you already have a business registered for this?
[4/18/23, 9:44:46 AM] Gary Teh: If yes, where is it already registered??
[4/18/23, 9:46:40 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: @13134136108 

With permission from @14153000019. 

Allow me to make a request.

Would you mind compiling something that includes the process, opportunity and challenges for this?

And then we can brainstorm and share ideas on the concerns and help fine tune the business process.
[4/18/23, 9:47:57 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: We have a lot of information and i am geographically stumped. The ideation is proving difficult.
[4/18/23, 9:54:03 AM] Gary Teh: Please 🙂🙏
[4/18/23, 9:54:18 AM] Gary Teh: Could you explain what you meant by geographically stumped?
[4/18/23, 10:00:10 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Yeah. The locations mentioned😄

Maybe a list would help of the probable farms and their locations.

To enable us to map out the region of target.
[4/18/23, 10:02:20 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! That is something I was meaning to ask as well
[4/18/23, 10:02:54 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Also for us to know the ports, the jurisdictions and jurisdictional requirements. Other variables for risk analysis etc. 

Also, what other externalities or potential products we can couple over time. All that. 

For us to capture the image well.
[4/18/23, 10:06:06 AM] Gary Teh: Are you referring to Colombia specifically where @13134136108 is operating is trying to setup a base or in general every location we are seeking to setup a base?
[4/18/23, 10:08:07 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: For @13134136108 first.
As we agreed to start somewhere and do an actual test.

For every base, i guess we'll capture that overtime, right?
[4/18/23, 10:09:31 AM] Gary Teh: Yes! 🤩
[4/18/23, 10:10:12 AM] Mukiri Mwirigi: Great😄
[4/18/23, 11:33:18 AM] Tess walkowski: This is a long and slow research list as I go one by one but this should be establishedn
[4/18/23, 11:34:00 AM] Tess walkowski: Not really. I have my EIN. An LLC and can do cottage industry
[4/18/23, 11:40:07 AM] Gary Teh: Which state is it registered under?
[4/18/23, 11:41:21 AM] Tess walkowski: Michigan

[4/18/23, 12:49:19 PM] Gary Teh: Had a chat with @971561302188 just now. There are cacao supplies coming out of Nigeria as well 

She has also already figured out how to clear the ports for up to 10kg of shipping 

Also we have figured out how to off-ramp USDT cryptocurrency sent her way to Nigeria for purchase of the raw materials

Seems the Lagos, Nigeria is the furthest along in terms of a source of supply with good visibility 

Let’s submit your vote for this poll if you haven’t already and conclude on which initial commodity we should focus on
[4/18/23, 1:37:19 PM] Gary Teh: Prompted ChatGpt with this 

TrueSight DAO is founded with the purpose of building a better world based on verifiable truth. Our core values are autonomy, integrity and diversity 

EcoVerse21 is a project of our DAO, it’s goal is to pre-purchase agricultural produce from marginalized small scale farmers for resale to international buyers

[4/18/23, 6:06:05 PM] Gary Teh: Am chatting with Hiro who is here on the boat with me. He spent the past four years cycling through South America

He is also heading into Columbia 

He has mentioned keen interest to help by getting to know people who work in ports. 

Seems he is a super connector

Let’s see if he bumps into any

Already during our hours long conversation he has shared so many insights he gleaned from locals he chatted with

He is fluent in Spanish
[4/18/23, 6:18:38 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s define what ethical means within this context
[4/18/23, 6:35:26 PM] Gary Teh: Once defined and agreed upon we can then extenc our white paper for it
[4/18/23, 10:38:45 PM] Anupa/diya: Great to see the progress  👏
[4/18/23, 10:42:25 PM] Anupa/diya: I think we can make a folder will all the documentation of ecoverse @14153000019 on the main Google drive so the engaged group

[4/19/23, 7:42:38 AM] Tess walkowski: Bc we also provide a solution for decentral trade
[4/19/23, 7:43:08 AM] Tess walkowski: I almost think we would want a brand
[4/19/23, 7:43:15 AM] Tess walkowski: Like dao cacao

Am chatting with Aleksa now about incorporating this project as it’s own legal entity under the TrueSight DAO umbrella

By the way, everybody please expect to receive a copy of an NDA soon. If you would like to continue contributing to this channel, please sign and revert the NDA form here 

This ensures all insights shared within this channel are not reused without authorization from TrueSight DAO 

For members who are uncomfortable signing the NDA, please do feel free to leave this channel 

Members who choose not to sign the NDA will be automatically booted out of this channel before we continue the next phase of this project so as to prevent conflict of interest 🙂👍
[4/20/23, 3:41:04 PM] Gary Teh: Also this governance framework drafted by Aleksa which had gone into effect this month will be how profits generated via this project will be distributed back to the parent DAO regarding any transactions passing through it that utilizes DAO resources

[4/21/23, 11:22:13 AM] Gary Teh: After observing Jorge and listening to Marcus (friend of @5511982667030) speak of the middle men, there seem to be two types 

Those that take inventory on credit thereby transferring the risk to the farmer (those that Marcus deal with) and those that undertake the risk of the shipment themselves (Jorge and Ashmati), my sense is there are no evil parties, it’s fundamentally about managing and minimizing inventory risk

Since it’s the consumer that realize the final value of the inventory, shouldn’t they be the ones that bear the inventory risk? 

If there was a way to pass all the inventory risk over to the consumer, my belief is that them at least having some common sense would probably avoid acquiring inventory from halfway around the world since those are the most risky

[4/21/23, 3:35:25 PM] Tess walkowski: But there are some crazy things.  Ok bananas for example.
[4/21/23, 3:35:52 PM] Tess walkowski: There are TWO companies controlling the global supply Frye and dole
[4/21/23, 3:36:40 PM] Tess walkowski: ....as my boss said, and he was 65.... Back in the day there were 20 varieties of banana available....

[4/21/23, 3:42:57 PM] Tess walkowski: Haha
[4/21/23, 3:46:56 PM] Gary Teh: Actually from my perspective doesn’t really matter that there are big players dominating the bulk and the bandwidth. Or even feel indignant that they are doing so. 

So long as there is market demand for some variant other than those provided by the big players and we could fulfill it, that is a good enough entry point to start deploying the land and expand strategy common amongst startups seeking to displace encumbants 🙂👍
[4/21/23, 3:48:23 PM] Gary Teh: If there is not market niche that could be capitalized then it’s just a waste of time throwing eggs against the wall. 

Come back later when the market has shifted and a gap appears 

Be one with DAO. Be water my friend
[4/21/23, 3:51:24 PM] Gary Teh: Have started conversations with this locally ran cacao cooperative in northern Brazil that supplies to Meiji Japan. 

Checking the paperwork they have available now and what other paperwork we need in place before the shipment could leave Brazilian port
[4/21/23, 4:09:32 PM] Tess walkowski: I like this attitude
[4/21/23, 4:09:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Also in a way if you can't beat them join them
[4/21/23, 4:10:10 PM] Tess walkowski: Willing to travel Gary with planning
[4/21/23, 4:10:34 PM] Tess walkowski: Hey also let's sign those NDAs :)
[4/21/23, 4:11:12 PM] Tess walkowski: Jump on a 15 with me and I will explain the niche
[4/21/23, 4:11:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Criolla raw cacao
[4/21/23, 4:11:42 PM] Tess walkowski: Gary, can you ask about the names of their tree species in Portuguese
[4/21/23, 4:11:55 PM] Tess walkowski: Be water love this
[4/21/23, 4:12:24 PM] Tess walkowski: Reason says Brazil will be easier.  I think export is more established there.
[4/21/23, 4:19:15 PM] Gary Teh: Hiro introduced me to two cacao producers 

The second producer says he is traveling and will revert once he returns

Will start looking at setting up the Brazilian exporting company once I get back to Brazil from my conference in Europe. 

Will be arriving back in São Paulo on 15th of May 

Have 30 days to kick start the paperwork from my time of arrival till getting booted out of the country 

Still waiting for TrueSight DAO’s governors inputs on the proposed NDA draft before we start releasing it to EcoVerse21 project participants to sign 🙂👍
[4/21/23, 4:21:00 PM] Tess walkowski: If not see you next year.
[4/21/23, 4:21:19 PM] Tess walkowski: The writing the photos the story
[4/21/23, 4:21:33 PM] Tess walkowski: That's what I am working on and helps us sell
[4/21/23, 4:22:14 PM] Tess walkowski: I'm still gonna find a way to realize my initial idea and micro fund my friends
[4/21/23, 4:22:36 PM] Tess walkowski: If we succeed once we can do more.
[4/21/23, 4:22:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Also where are we gonna send the cacoa
[4/21/23, 4:24:26 PM] Gary Teh: That is why we need the NDA signed before we proceed to the next step

Next step is compiling the prospective buyers list and start doing the outreach
[4/21/23, 4:25:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Yeah that's nda
[4/21/23, 4:25:26 PM] Tess walkowski: It overlaps with my own business and interest so as we share those contacts
[4/21/23, 4:25:43 PM] Tess walkowski: I guess we research both. Producers and consumers
[4/21/23, 4:25:54 PM] Gary Teh: Otherwise anyone with access to the supplies could just take the compiled list and run with it, this impacting the efforts of DAo members, without consequences
[4/21/23, 4:27:34 PM] Tess walkowski: Also I am one of them
[4/21/23, 4:27:48 PM] Tess walkowski: I mean I brand under atelier lumina
[4/21/23, 4:28:18 PM] Tess walkowski: And yes I am planning to sell and make a website for ceremonial grade cacoa
[4/21/23, 4:28:30 PM] Tess walkowski: And these health truffles
[4/21/23, 4:28:37 PM] Gary Teh: 🙂👍
[4/21/23, 4:28:46 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect!
[4/21/23, 4:35:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Where are you currently
[4/21/23, 4:37:59 PM] Gary Teh: Once the trade link between Brazil and Northern America is setup, my goal is to setup another trade link between Brazil and China 

It’s almost a no brainer after having spoken to quite a few locals on the boat here in the Amazon 

I have been studying China’s belt road initiative ever since leaving my position in the previous company 

Since 2005, China has surpassed US as Brazil’s largest trading partner 

I am a native Chinese speaker so it makes sense for me to just head into China to find buyers for soy and setup another trade route between Brazil and China
[4/21/23, 4:38:11 PM] Gary Teh: Prompted ChatGpt with this question. 

Which Latin American country will benefit the most from china’s belt road initiative?
[4/21/23, 4:38:24 PM] Tess walkowski: Do china first
[4/21/23, 4:38:29 PM] Gary Teh: This was the response 

Several Latin American countries are expected to benefit from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is a global infrastructure development strategy. However, the countries that stand to benefit the most are likely to be those that have the strongest trade and investment ties with China, as well as those that have demonstrated commitment to infrastructure development and attract investment. 

One country that has been identified as a potential beneficiary is Brazil, which is one of the largest commodity exporters in the world and has significant infrastructure needs. In recent years, China has become Brazil's top trading partner and a major investor in the country's infrastructure projects, including major oil and gas ventures. 

Other countries in the region, such as Peru and Chile, are also likely to benefit from the BRI due to their strategic location and strong trade ties with China. However, it is still too early to determine the exact extent of the benefits that Latin America will receive from the BRI, as the initiative is still in its early stages of development.
[4/21/23, 4:38:49 PM] Tess walkowski: China is easier my friend
[4/21/23, 4:38:53 PM] Gary Teh: That is a different set of commodities
[4/21/23, 4:39:16 PM] Tess walkowski: True. Probably.
[4/21/23, 4:39:46 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s just focus on one. 

Shifting target just causes everybody to lose focus and cause this project to degenerate into a useless chatroom
[4/21/23, 4:40:36 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/21/23, 4:40:53 PM] Gary Teh: We will finish setting up one trade route and then we move on to setup the next one
[4/21/23, 4:40:44 PM] Tess walkowski: It is easier by far to trade with china
[4/21/23, 4:40:57 PM] Tess walkowski: That would be the only pro
[4/21/23, 4:41:24 PM] Gary Teh: Then rinse and repeat the strategy till we have a whole bunch of them coming out of Brazil
[4/21/23, 4:41:20 PM] Tess walkowski: So we focus on Brazil usa
[4/21/23, 4:41:27 PM] Tess walkowski: Then Colombia usa
[4/21/23, 4:41:57 PM] Tess walkowski: And Colombia
[4/21/23, 4:42:00 PM] Tess walkowski: Peru
[4/21/23, 4:42:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Mexico
[4/21/23, 4:44:30 PM] Gary Teh: Yeah. 

Can you go figure out the full set of permits you need before your shipment of cacao is allowed to leave columbian ports?

List them all on a google word document and then share it once everybody signs NDA 

Texting and dumping all the details in this chatroom is not really useful in helping everybody keep update, and just this chatroom look really cluttered. 

I am starting to do the same on the Brazilian side

[4/21/23, 8:48:25 PM] Gary Teh: @554792591729 you mentioned your mum went for a cacao ceremony recently in Florianopolis 

Do you know where the shamans sourced their supplies from?
[4/21/23, 8:52:38 PM] Tess walkowski: It's a word people use to describe cacao
[4/21/23, 8:53:00 PM] Tess walkowski: Usually ethically sourced high quality
[4/21/23, 8:53:22 PM] Tess walkowski: It is cacao. Ie cacao solid.
[4/21/23, 8:53:50 PM] Tess walkowski: Nibs are this broken up
[4/21/23, 8:55:23 PM] Tess walkowski: Chocolate liquor is when cacao solid are separated from cacao butter , this is then used to make what we know as chocolate
[4/21/23, 8:55:54 PM] Tess walkowski: Usually ceremonially would be criolla or another original strane ie the least bitter strains
[4/21/23, 9:10:28 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 do you know a community of shamans in the US that use cacao?
[4/22/23, 2:39:17 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, we are still waiting for your filled out business model canvas.
[4/21/23, 9:23:25 PM] Tess walkowski: I do. Have participated and hosted.
[4/21/23, 9:23:53 PM] Tess walkowski: Most major cities have them.
[4/21/23, 9:24:54 PM] Tess walkowski: I wouldn't call them shamans. I know people who also consume daily.
[4/22/23, 12:06:17 AM] Barbara Sandini: I don’t know but I can totally ask . There are so many tribes that use
[4/22/23, 5:07:50 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! Now this becomes a highly differentiated product

[4/22/23, 6:42:12 AM] Gary Teh: How big is your total addressable market in the US?
[4/22/23, 6:42:33 AM] Gary Teh: Suppliers are asking for quantity to be shipped
[4/22/23, 6:47:22 AM] Gary Teh: Could you provide an estimate by next week?
[4/22/23, 7:28:10 AM] Tess walkowski: Where these trees grow criolla is along amazon Ecuador / Colombia / Brazil / venezuala / Peru
[4/22/23, 7:28:22 AM] Tess walkowski: Mexico has its own special beans.
[4/22/23, 7:29:19 AM] Tess walkowski: It depends on the strength of my brand, story and values.
[4/22/23, 7:29:54 AM] Tess walkowski: Two weeks. Going to a more commercial cacao farm tomorrow
[4/22/23, 7:31:19 AM] Tess walkowski: Ceremonial cacao retails 55 - 70 a lb
[4/22/23, 7:32:12 AM] Tess walkowski: This info will be in my plan

[4/22/23, 8:09:47 AM] Fatima: Tess, I would like to ask you to bring to this group messages that are more organized and based on facts and market research.

I understand that you’re touched by the poverty in South America and want to help, but this is about philanthropy.

I practice philanthropy in my private life. But, this channel is about business.

I particularly read enough your random data. 
So, I kindly ask you to bring market analysis and quality research-based data so we can have a deeper discussion and not simply travel report.
[4/22/23, 9:29:05 AM] Gary Teh: If a localized supply chain already requires so much faith in god, i wonder how much more faith out DAO will need to undertake an international supply chain. 🤔

[4/22/23, 3:19:09 PM] Tess walkowski: I was responding to a question about where cacao is grown.     And a question about what is ceremonial cacao.
[4/22/23, 3:21:22 PM] Tess walkowski: Gary is sharing pictures of his watermelons. And I am writing research articles about cacao
[4/22/23, 3:24:31 PM] Tess walkowski: This is a fact not speculation.  And facts are what support the differention of criolla from other beans.    Or the difference between commercially grown monoculture and smaller sustinance farming

Maybe Gary is bringing another project to this group. 
If not, out of context, as you mentioned.
[4/22/23, 5:04:17 PM] Tess walkowski: What was your message contributing?  Other than being critical.     I am trying to focus in and add value.  And I see much value in learning how trade routes operate.   I am here bc I have an interest in how we could leverage daos in trade. Absolutely small farmers having equity is important to me.  But if this is not productive then I also won't continue.
[4/22/23, 5:16:39 PM] Fatima: When the Business Model Canvas of your project is ready, I believe people here can share insights and contribute.
[4/22/23, 5:19:35 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/22/23, 5:25:07 PM] Gary Teh: Yes, having an updated business model canvas is what we have agreed upon. 

Otherwise too many messages and other chatroom members are having a hard time following the series of messages to construct the updated mental model in their head of what where the state of the project is and what next 

Not being able to follow, they won’t be able to contribute because they have no idea the state of the project

And then not being able to contribute, they first disengage and then later drop out of the project 🤔

To help manage this problem of information overload folks who just want to ignore all the clutter in our chatroom please just reference our primary business model canvas 🙂👍

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/canvas
[4/26/23, 9:34:55 AM] Gary Teh: Getting more details from the two cacao producers that Hiro introduced now. They work with their local cooperatives. 

They are right now reaching out to their local cooperatives to get more information on export permits they already have 

Meanwhile I will be circling back to @6598622082 and the contacts on his end which have more information on international buyers

Once we get more visibility on both sides we might then be able to fill out more details in the business model canvas for this project
[4/26/23, 9:41:27 AM] Gary Teh: While we might have aspirations to serve small scale marginalized communities, based on what I am seeing right now it makes more sense to figure out where the actual market gap is and then fill it. I am sure where along the way market opportunities will arise that will lead us closer to further in the direction of our idealism

From my perspective it is always important to have a healthy balance of idealism and pragmatism when operating projects. 

The main difference between Jesus and common mortals is that when the former chooses to survive purely on idealism, he got resurrected three days after his passing. Whereas the common mortal just stays dead.
[4/26/23, 9:57:04 AM] Tess walkowski: I think based on what we have to tackle with regulations, yes we need someone more developed who has the ability to export
[4/26/23, 9:57:37 AM] Tess walkowski: I agree on that too, being led by product market fit
[4/27/23, 3:33:13 PM] Gary Teh: We have got a shaman grade cacao supplier from Ecuador that could provide cacao supplies

There are two options available we can choose to interface with. 

Option 1: White label 

We will need to get our own USFDA approval and import custom clearance done



Option 2: become a distributor 

Supplies will be fully customs cleared for the US with USFDA certification done. We will need to cobrand with the supplier for the goods we plan to distribute in the US

Which one shall we go for?
[4/27/23, 3:33:49 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Which option shall we opt for
‎OPTION: Whitelabel our own (3 votes)
‎OPTION: Be a distributor and cobrand (3 votes)
[4/27/23, 3:54:53 PM] Tess walkowski: White label.  The DAO verified the cacao provider. Future cacao is possible.  DAO becomes a brand.
[4/27/23, 3:55:15 PM] Tess walkowski: Distributor. Way easier first step. Simpler. Cheaper
[4/27/23, 3:56:01 PM] Tess walkowski: DAO defines "shaman grade"
[4/27/23, 3:56:10 PM] Tess walkowski: "ceremonial grade"
[4/27/23, 5:17:27 PM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps we do distribution approach while we figure out the end to end nuts and bolts of setting up the cacao distribution business in the US

Once we get more familiar we can start transition to white labeling perhaps with other suppliers?
[4/27/23, 5:18:21 PM] Gary Teh: Right now, I am still not at all comfortable with the distribution business since we don’t even have any visibility yet on where we are going to find the buyers
‎[4/27/23, 5:46:14 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[4/27/23, 8:13:49 PM] Tess walkowski: Also warehousing?
[4/27/23, 8:14:33 PM] Tess walkowski: Maybe let product market fit answer. Who are our consumers?
[4/27/23, 8:18:49 PM] Anupa/diya: In many countries even in India there are these expos where buyers meet. In India the largest food and hospitality exp happens in March. I know  usa and Germany is quite  big in this
[4/27/23, 8:20:05 PM] Anupa/diya: I had a document somewhere from my earlier project. Let me look at that

[4/28/23, 5:24:07 AM] Gary Teh: I took a step back and re-examined the situation

If the mission of EcoVerse21 is to help small scale marginalized farmers gain access to international buyers through pre-purchases, wouldn’t the proliferation of the knowledge on how to do so encourage more people to help actualize that?

But wouldn’t the free proliferation of these knowledge compromise on the profitability thus viability of the project itself. 

And if such is the case, why should members continue contributing to the project if the knowledge is that at some point the project might self sabotage by proliferating this knowledge for the greater good of its mission? 

Seems like a catch 22.

Let’s take a poll on this.

[4/28/23, 5:32:56 AM] Francois renet: Isn’t it where a smart contract model that guarantees a paid commission on transaction a solution to the income stream? You use the platform. You sell or buy. Eco21 gets a cut automatically?

[4/28/23, 6:02:19 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, I figured out how to gain access to all the potential
Cacao buyers in the US. 

Will extend our white paper later with the two tier model I have in mind that will allow external investors to stake their funds for investment returns to finance the cost of inventory, shipment and storage prior to sales and delivery. 🙂👍

Since the external investors will be bearing the bulk of the financial risk, the DAO return’s will primarily be just an infrastructure provider charging a transaction fee.
[4/28/23, 6:59:54 AM] Tess walkowski: My small personal capital is going into cacao, and absolutely my goal is to sell it.    But it gets me product in my hands that I can use to explain what ceremonial cacao is.
[4/28/23, 7:01:02 AM] Tess walkowski: The smart contract could do this.
[4/28/23, 7:53:38 AM] Gary Teh: One of the key things that really stood out based on what @13134136108 @41765737357 @254700187599 as well as from what I understood from the other ceremonial grade cacao supplier is that these supplies cannot be treated as normal commodities. 

the story component is as important if not way more so than the product itself. 

Story will compromise of the culture and history of the community that produced it, the sustainable farming methods they use and how the profits generated via the sales of their product are channeled back to developing their community’s infrastructure 

In that regard traditional distribution models will not work. Here is why. when dealing with a conventional commodity trader, from his perspective one cacao nut is no different from the other cacao nut. But from an enlightened truth seeking consumer’s perspective, the difference between one and another is world’s apart especially if the other is produced by Monsanto Inc where GMO techniques has been heavily applied. 

The way I see it we will end up setting up and operating a direct to consumer distribution model. 

The whole tokenomics is now crystal clear in my head.
[4/28/23, 7:55:50 AM] Tess walkowski: Thats hitting the nail on the head

2. How much demand for this type of cocoa? 
3. Who are the potential clients? Only for rituals?
How much are they willing to pay?

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/noncompete

I have consulted with @381644913030, since TrueSight DAO and Ecoverse21 does not yet have a legal off chain representation, any an agreements signed with them as counter party will not be legally binding. 

Thus the workaround is in the event of a breach of trust, TrueSight Inc (a technology solutions provider for TrueSight DAO) will pursue its rectification on behalf of Ecoverse21 under the US, Delaware Jurisdiction.
[4/28/23, 12:10:47 PM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‎You changed the group name to “[guild][project] Ecoverse21”

[4/29/23, 6:46:15 AM] Tess walkowski: How do I sign an NDA when I am in the cacao business myself?  I am micro scale but still?
[4/29/23, 6:52:41 AM] Gary Teh: The key part is you do not utilize any of the information or contact information released within this chatroom for your business. 

And you agree that whatever information you choose to release within this chatroom that gets utilized by EcoVerse21 will grant you governance tokens in our DAO. 

After understanding your profile this is how I think you can contribute to EcoVerse21 

I observed your strengths directly relevant to the scope of this project are in sourcing, writing and also due to your proximity to the cacao farmers ability to make videos and photos
[4/29/23, 6:59:16 AM] Gary Teh: This non-compete agreement is pertaining to proprietary data contributed by all members towards the blueprint for building out of all the logistics and legal plumbing we will be putting in place. 

Once we have done a few iterations we will be creating a platform on top of this plumbing where we allow small scale farmers and their representative to list their inventory for sale and pre-purchase by us for resale to the international buyers we will bring in via our distribution pipeline. 

From my perspective, you fall nicely into the role of the farmer representative too. However that is a latter stage
[4/29/23, 6:59:41 AM] Tess walkowski: What I would see as an ideal outcome, it DAO cacao to succeed and to have it be a vetted source
[4/29/23, 7:00:48 AM] Tess walkowski: I could have led the tour yesterday.

[4/29/23, 7:03:28 AM] Gary Teh: Would love to here more of that but Let’s shift this discussion to the beer hall 

As @5511982667030 has suggested We should focus discussion in this room to just business operations 🙂👍
[4/29/23, 7:05:19 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, folks I have managed to figure out our warehousing facilities in the US 

Once done with tokenomics will shift focus to competitive analysis, thereafter profit and loss analysis 🙂👍
[4/29/23, 7:16:27 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[4/29/23, 7:21:31 AM] Gary Teh: I have also been thinking through the advice from @381644913030, @5511982667030 about being selective in the proprietary information that gets exposed in this specific instance as well as similar advice given by @6598383264 and @41799155602 on matter of similar nature back last year. 

The white paper is a public facing document, it's intention is to attract audience interested in contributing to building out our engine or financing the transactions passing through once the engine is built. 

Rather than exposing the entire operating blueprint to the public to freely replicate, it will only contain high level information about our project. Key information about the inner mechanics of the engine will be omitted.

There will be a separate document called the Ecoverse21 operating manual where the entire end to end system is defined along with all the nitty gritty details for building the marketing, logistics, legal and financing functions for each new territory we plan to source from and plan to distribute into. 

This document will only be exposed to members who have already signed and submitted to a copy of the non-compete agreement in this chatroom.
[4/29/23, 8:16:54 AM] Dr. Denis: ‎Dr. Denis requested to join
[5/2/23, 12:46:31 PM] Gary Teh: Finished conducting market research to figure out the various market positioning and their profit potential for cacao in the US.

Exact details will be updated in the operations manual and will only be released to participants that have signed the non-compete agreement 

https://truesight.me/dao/ecoverse21/noncompete

Up next:
    - figure out the costing for regulation 
    - figure out packaging cost 
    - figure out variable costing of warehousing facilities 
   - figure out variable costing of freighting into US

With that we should have an excel sheet where we simply insert the price small scale agricultural producers and their representatives are proposing to us for pre-purchase and a simple Yes or No with our response based on the economics of the situation
[5/2/23, 12:47:45 PM] Gary Teh: For a high level of the various roles you can contribute within the scope of this project please refer to

[5/2/23, 7:07:36 PM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‎You changed the group description
[5/3/23, 2:35:28 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 you send more photos of the family, the farm and the cacao over? 

Let’s see if we can out together some marketing materials to test the market receptiveness for our cacao NFT collection these few days during the conference
[5/3/23, 2:36:58 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes. I'll text you so I don't spam the group
[5/3/23, 2:38:27 PM] Gary Teh: Great! 🤩
[5/5/23, 1:24:16 AM] Gary Teh: Trialed tested the high level parameters of the NFTs we will be floating with the audience I spoke with yesterday, given the kind of ROIs and return period,  seems they will get over subscribed once they become available
[5/5/23, 7:36:05 AM] Tess walkowski: What is the nft?
[5/5/23, 9:12:05 AM] Gary Teh: It’s the NFT that will be issued to the financing contributors in exchange for financing the shipments of agricultural products from small scale farmers from South America to North America as documented in our white paper. 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper

Initially these will be cacaos. Later on they will represent shipments of other agricultural produce
[5/5/23, 11:25:47 AM] Gary Teh: I have been having discussions with CEO of EthicHub which provides agricultural financing to the small scale coffee farmers in Mexico. 

The distribution networks we will be setting up to distribute agricultural produce from small scale farmers to end consumers is a perfect complement with their project.
[5/5/23, 2:43:35 PM] Gary Teh: The real work as everyone I spoken with seem to have correctly identified is the offline heavy lifting needed to go into the legal, logistics, warehousing and marketing aspects of setting up the distribution network 

Once the distribution network is up and running, providing liquidity via the NFTs associated with the shipment of the agricultural produce from these small scale marginalized farmers passing through the distribution network is a no-brainer.
[5/6/23, 3:22:21 PM] Gary Teh: Quick updates
————
Just got the pricing details from the Brazilian CooP based in Baha’i 

Still awaiting for the pricing details from the supplier based in Ecuador which will become available next Tuesday 

@13134136108 has reached out to the freighting company based on Colombia.
[5/7/23, 6:33:37 AM] Gary Teh: Am exploring the packaging (white labeling) with the cooperative President based in Baha’i. 

We need designs for those.
[5/7/23, 6:35:39 AM] Anupa/diya: I should have some samples
[5/7/23, 6:35:50 AM] Anupa/diya: I can share
[5/7/23, 6:36:09 AM] Anupa/diya: It also depends on the printing style
[5/7/23, 6:36:16 AM] Anupa/diya: And gms
[5/7/23, 10:46:05 AM] Tess walkowski: I have a document available after the NDA, and will do a write up about the issues I encounter.
[5/7/23, 10:49:23 AM] Tess walkowski: Simple is the company in Colombia must have an nit , as well as the company in USA needs to be established
[5/7/23, 10:50:13 AM] Tess walkowski: I work a lot with sacred geometry , I liked a lot the seed diagram I got off Wikipedia

[5/7/23, 11:09:38 AM] Gary Teh: What a coincidence Aga works a lot with acted geometry with that too 🤩
[5/7/23, 11:32:36 AM] Gary Teh: What is an NIT?
[5/7/23, 11:32:57 AM] Tess walkowski: There version of an LLC
[5/7/23, 11:33:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Tif is the small. NIT for larger
[5/7/23, 11:36:22 AM] Gary Teh: Colombian based LLC?
[5/7/23, 11:41:16 AM] Dr. Denis: ‎Dr. Denis joined from the community
[5/7/23, 11:44:32 AM] Dr. Denis: ‎You removed Dr. Denis
[5/7/23, 11:44:43 AM] <guild>[project] Agroverse: ‎You changed the settings so only admins can edit the group settings
[5/7/23, 11:47:22 AM] Tess walkowski: That's what an nit is yeah
[5/7/23, 11:47:39 AM] Tess walkowski: To work with Colombia best, we would need a company
[5/7/23, 11:48:58 AM] Tess walkowski: We still need a USA LLC. I have one personal. But the dao needs an LLC/ein all that fun stuff
[5/7/23, 11:49:38 AM] Tess walkowski: There are better states to start llcs, so we should look where has most advantages
[5/7/23, 11:49:45 AM] Tess walkowski: Nevada is good I know
[5/7/23, 11:50:28 AM] Tess walkowski: There are a few initiatives to start trade with cacao from the side of the government
[5/7/23, 11:50:53 AM] Gary Teh: Getting Suheil to sign a copy of the non compete before we bring him in

Meanwhile I have booted Dr Denis out because he still hasn’t sign the non-compete and neither has he clearly stated how he would like to contribute to this project 🙂👍
[5/7/23, 11:51:41 AM] Gary Teh: Will the Delaware C-corp work?
[5/7/23, 11:51:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I have been spammed from this group so yeah being careful.  I don't actually know how to sign it.  :)
[5/7/23, 11:52:45 AM] Gary Teh: Let me go setup docusign
[5/7/23, 11:54:31 AM] Gary Teh: Who was the spammer? 

We need to boot him/her out ASAP.

Please do a screenshot of the spam message and share here 🙂👍

[5/7/23, 12:07:11 PM] Tess walkowski: I'll forward it to your email
[5/7/23, 12:07:43 PM] Tess walkowski: Or maybe add that in nda. Don't solicite.
[5/7/23, 12:09:36 PM] Gary Teh: Solicitation is a bootable offense that is already written in our DAO’s white paper 

https://TrueSight.me/whitepaper
[5/7/23, 1:57:39 PM] Gary Teh: Or we could have three US based members within this guild volunteer as directors for the Nevada LLC
[5/7/23, 2:20:43 PM] Tess walkowski: Who ever has lowest taxes.
[5/7/23, 2:21:15 PM] Tess walkowski: Was discussing now. Ecuador may be the best first move....
[5/7/23, 2:21:39 PM] Tess walkowski: Doing business in Colombia is a challenge.
[5/7/23, 6:48:37 PM] Anupa/diya: @13134136108 do you have the packaging details and the branding
[5/7/23, 6:57:45 PM] Tess walkowski: You are also working with sacred geometry

[5/7/23, 9:42:34 PM] Anupa/diya: Sure. The packaging will depend on the gms it's been sold in 5 kg + to 100 gms. That will also determine the printing style
[5/7/23, 9:43:12 PM] Tess walkowski: As does product market fit :)
[5/7/23, 9:43:40 PM] Tess walkowski: But I can share some stuff if you want to play around.
[5/7/23, 11:24:30 PM] Gary Teh: Could we use the brand EcoVerse21 along with the designs? 

Unless folks here want to change the project name to atelier luminas? 

Let’s do a poll
[5/7/23, 11:42:20 PM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
What is the project name we should go forward with?
‎OPTION: Atelier Luminas (0 votes)
‎OPTION: EcoVerse21 (0 votes)
[5/7/23, 11:43:25 PM] Anupa/diya: Is this like a sub brand of ecoverse or is it a stand alone brand
[5/7/23, 11:46:30 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense to ask this question. What are your thoughts? 

@13134136108 introduced the name Atelier Luminas in her graphics
[5/7/23, 11:49:41 PM] Anupa/diya: It is like Fanta ... is a sub brand the coca cola company.  .

The products would go out as atelier Luminas ... under ecoverse 21

Or it would go out as a complete separate entity
[5/7/23, 11:50:04 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective we should just stick to EcoVerse21 for all the products shipped via the direct to consumer distribution channels we setup
[5/7/23, 11:50:16 PM] Anupa/diya: It would be like nice to this of some cacao centric names for the product fit.
[5/7/23, 11:50:26 PM] Anupa/diya: Think
[5/7/23, 11:51:40 PM] Anupa/diya: Maybe we use the name of the plant criollo.. like cricollo   summer. I don't know ..  something catchy
[5/8/23, 12:03:41 AM] Murtaza: I agree with Anupa teh company name can be Ecoverse but the brand name can be made more appealing to the consumer market
[5/8/23, 12:29:19 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s suggest a few names related to cacao for the white labeling route.

Meanwhile will be speaking with the Ecuador based exporter tomorrow. If we take this route We will be co-branding with them. Then we will be using their brand name and using EcoVerse21 our project name
[5/8/23, 2:05:22 AM] Anupa/diya: The name will also depend on the market fit and user group.
[5/8/23, 2:09:54 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s be more verbose 

Suggest 3 names
[5/8/23, 2:40:02 AM] Gary Teh: This implies you have done some research on market fit 🤩
[5/8/23, 6:01:42 AM] Tess walkowski: Bc that's my own brand probably non
[5/8/23, 6:04:40 AM] Tess walkowski: Agree in a way but ecoverse doesn't make you hungry
[5/8/23, 6:08:35 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is one product
[5/8/23, 6:10:00 AM] Tess walkowski: Using the name criolla is important.
[5/8/23, 6:54:05 AM] Tess walkowski: But it will not be our only export in time
[5/8/23, 6:54:41 AM] Tess walkowski: Product market fit, I can't answer in entirity....
[5/8/23, 6:55:11 AM] Tess walkowski: Are you all sold on a minimum $40 unsweetened bar of cacao ....
[5/8/23, 6:55:41 AM] Tess walkowski: I am but I am into this stuff
[5/8/23, 6:56:34 AM] Tess walkowski: There are some options too....for example chocolate makers luxury ones may prefer beans
[5/8/23, 6:56:56 AM] Tess walkowski: Criolla is used it's just rarely sold on the commodities market
[5/8/23, 6:57:19 AM] Tess walkowski: Ecudar is prob not criolla it's a tree called national
[5/8/23, 6:57:36 AM] Tess walkowski: It could be criolla.
[5/9/23, 8:57:18 AM] Gary Teh: Finished chatting with Ecuador exporter 

Key insights 
    - cacao paste has unlimited shelf life. Taste gets better with time 

    - our DAO has more than enough funds to pull off our very first end to end transaction

[5/9/23, 1:16:11 PM] Gary Teh: We already have the market analysis report available
We are right now working on the Profit and Loss analysis after putting in all the costing from the various suppliers.
[5/9/23, 1:36:06 PM] Gary Teh: The cost items for the various components will be in soon. 

They will be break downs between lump sum fixed costs items that will need to be amortized across all the units of sales and variable costs which scales as units of sales increases
[5/9/23, 1:57:09 PM] Tess walkowski: I can sell it along my Colombian
[5/9/23, 1:57:41 PM] Tess walkowski: I didn't know that about the shelf like. The fat must preserve it. Or all the tannins.  Wow.
[5/9/23, 1:58:21 PM] Tess walkowski: Then I can feature the dao as well as I sell and begin to educate and connect further
[5/9/23, 1:58:54 PM] Tess walkowski: See other thread.  Perhaps something related to that.

[5/9/23, 5:17:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Emailed to you?
[5/9/23, 5:18:09 PM] Tess walkowski: Is his cacao criolla or trinitario? I think they use the word "nationale" maybe
[5/9/23, 5:19:06 PM] Gary Teh: You can email me the signed copy or just post it here. I will have the signed copy uploaded to our EcoVerse21 project folders 🙂👍
[5/9/23, 5:19:22 PM] Gary Teh: Mainly criolla

[5/9/23, 5:32:29 PM] Gary Teh: It’s another one of my favorites 😍
[5/9/23, 5:33:40 PM] Gary Teh: But first let’s get the cacao supply chain going to restore environmental and social Justice 

Once that is humming along smoothly, lets extend our distribution network to support other SKUs 🙂👍

[5/10/23, 4:06:39 AM] Anupa/diya: Fluidity in cash and payment is something that becomes in these industries whether it is loans, payments, and other aspects
[5/10/23, 4:08:55 AM] Gary Teh: Got it. Mainly addresses their lack of funds to buy seeds. 

It would be beneficial for our project if it takes off as it will mean for inventory passing through our distribution networks 🙂👍
[5/10/23, 6:08:43 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys!
[5/10/23, 6:09:14 AM] Francois renet: Check out this article. It might be worth reaching out to the founder of this platform that he has built already!

[5/10/23, 6:25:38 AM] Gary Teh: It is similar to what @918017107841 surfaced but not the use case our guild has voted to go after. In this case it is to buy a shipment from cacao from South America right now and have it sold in Northern America.

It might make sense to reach out to them but much later on when we start looking at Coffee. However from what I am seeing, might not be directly relevant since we will be looking to procure coffee supplies but they are looking to provide loans to the coffee farmers.
[5/10/23, 6:30:29 AM] Francois renet: I’m sure @41765737357 knows this already, but a friend told me recently that one of the best companies to approach when looking for leftover cacao shells etc… is Nestle in Switzerland

[5/10/23, 10:05:03 AM] Gary Teh: The species we have sourced from Ecuador is Arriba Nacional

It is a different type of cacao compared to criolla
[5/10/23, 10:05:22 AM] Gary Teh: This is what ChatGpt mentioned 

Arriba Nacional and Criollo are two different types of cacao.

Arriba Nacional, as mentioned earlier, is a variety of cacao that is primarily grown in the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is known for its unique fruity and floral flavor profile and its aroma. Arriba Nacional is typically a fine-flavored cacao variety, which means it has a high percentage of cocoa butter and lower bitterness. 

Criollo, on the other hand, is another type of cacao that is known for being a rare and high-quality variety. Criollo is typically grown in Central America and the northern regions of South America, including Venezuela and Colombia. Unlike Arriba Nacional, Criollo has a more delicate flavor profile that is characterized by its nutty and floral notes and its low acidity.

One of the main differences between Arriba Nacional and Criollo is their genetic makeup. While Criollo is known for being genetically diverse, Arriba Nacional has a relatively consistent genetic profile. Criollo is also considered to be a more fragile variety that is more susceptible to disease and environmental stress than Arriba Nacional.

Overall, both Arriba Nacional and Criollo are prized for their unique flavor profiles and their status as rare and high-quality cacao varieties. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct differences that make them recognizable to chocolate makers and connoisseurs around the world.
[5/10/23, 10:06:51 AM] Anupa/diya: @13134136108 could you share a copy of a sample grading spec sheet for Cacao
[5/10/23, 10:23:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Variaties are distinguished via genetics
[5/10/23, 10:24:19 AM] Tess walkowski: Based on recent discoveries this "national" may be related to the original cacao of Ecuador
[5/10/23, 10:24:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Here is wild ....there it was cultivated....5000 years ago

[5/10/23, 10:26:42 AM] Tess walkowski: I would say based on initial research that national is none of the above
[5/10/23, 10:28:17 AM] Anupa/diya: I am sure buyers want to see grading sheets . Do you know where I can find one
[5/10/23, 10:29:32 AM] Tess walkowski: I don't know what you are referring to
[5/10/23, 10:53:20 AM] Gary Teh: ChatGpt response 

Cocoa grading systems depend on the country of origin. Here are some examples:

1. International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) grading system: This is a standard grading system used by most producers. It categorizes cacao beans as Grade I, Grade II, or Grade III based on quality.

2. Brazilian grading system: In Brazil, cocoa is graded by its fermentation and drying stages. The stages are referred to as “superior”, “good”, “mixed”, “fair”, and “poor”. 

3. Venezuelan grading system: In Venezuela, cocoa beans are graded based on their color, appearance, and aroma. The grading system works in a hierarchy system, starting from “Superior” and going down to “Low Quality.”

In general, cocoa grades are determined by factors such as size, appearance, color, and flavor. Higher grade cacao tends to have a better flavor, aroma, and overall quality. The grading system can be useful for determining the value of the cacao beans as well as matching them to specific uses.
[5/10/23, 10:53:33 AM] Gary Teh: In short suppliers will provide grading information
[5/10/23, 10:54:43 AM] Gary Teh: In Brazil, cacao is graded by its fermentation and drying stages. The Brazilian cacao grading system classifies cocoa beans into five grades based on their visual appearance and aroma:

1. Superior: Superior beans are fully fermented and dried, with a shiny and smooth surface. They have a uniform size and color and a fruity and floral aroma.

2. Good: Good beans are also fully fermented and dried, but may have a slightly rough surface and less uniform size. They have a mild aroma and flavor.

3. Mixed: Mixed beans are partially fermented and dried, with a reddish-brown color and a rough surface. They have a sour or musty aroma and flavor.

4. Fair: Fair beans are under-fermented and poorly dried, with a grayish-white color and a moldy or off-flavor aroma.

5. Low Quality: Low-quality beans are poorly fermented and dried, with a discolored and broken surface. They have a strong and unpleasant odor and flavor.

Overall, the Brazilian grading system emphasizes the importance of proper fermentation and drying in producing high-quality cocoa beans. Superior and good beans are considered suitable for producing high-quality chocolate, while mixed, fair, and low-quality beans are typically used for other products, such as industrial chocolate and cocoa powder.
[5/10/23, 10:55:58 AM] Gary Teh: Ecuador, known for the famous Arriba Nacional cacao beans, has its own grading system for cocoa beans. The system is based on the size, color, and quality of the beans. Here are the grades and their characteristics:

1. Fino de Aroma: This is the highest grade of Ecuadorian cacao, which is defined by the International Cocoa Organization as having a distinct and fine aroma. Fino de Aroma beans are large, plump, and uniform in size, with a shiny and unblemished surface. They have a delicate flavor with floral and fruity notes.

2. Aroma: Aroma beans are the second-highest grade and have a similar aroma to Fino de Aroma beans, but are slightly smaller and less uniform in size.

3. CCN-51: CCN-51 is a hybrid bean developed in Ecuador and is known for its high yield. It is a lower grade bean compared to Fino de Aroma and Aroma, and is used for mass-produced chocolate and cocoa products.

4. Nacional: Nacional beans are native to Ecuador and are known for their distinctive floral aroma and nutty flavor. They have a slightly lower quality compared to Fino de Aroma and Aroma beans, and are often used for bulk production.

5. Other: This grade includes any beans that do not meet the standards of the above grades, such as those with defects, uneven size, or an inferior aroma and flavor.

Overall, the Ecuadorian grading system places a high value on the aroma of the cocoa beans, with Fino de Aroma beans being considered the highest quality due to their distinct and fine aroma and delicate flavor.

[5/10/23, 1:40:08 PM] Gary Teh: Let's each of us provide a weekly update on our progress here in this channel pertaining to the roadmap for this project.
[5/10/23, 1:45:10 PM] Tess walkowski: What about crypto fests?
[5/10/23, 1:46:22 PM] Gary Teh: That works too
[5/10/23, 1:51:00 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 please create a google sheet and start adding those events into it.
[5/10/23, 1:51:43 PM] Tess walkowski: There are some in there now
[5/10/23, 1:53:09 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! I see it 🙂🙏
[5/10/23, 2:14:49 PM] Gary Teh: Brazilian side supply of cacao is mainly trinitario and a little forestario
[5/10/23, 2:18:03 PM] Tess walkowski: I want my wild criolla :) ok later.  And I'll at least have some!
[5/10/23, 2:18:35 PM] Tess walkowski: I will brainstorm more later and add too it as I think of ideas
[5/10/23, 2:58:29 PM] Gary Teh: I realized the confusion some sections of the white paper is causing after receiving signals from @19514467219 @918017107841 and @972509342179 

Updated it to totally remove all contents related to providing micro loans to the farmers 

There are already tons of projects doing that 

We are buying their produce and directl selling these to end consumers

I will try to have the same done on my side 

That way we know who we will be working with on the US side 

@13134136108 I see you have been productive 

Keep up the effort 🙂👍
[5/12/23, 9:46:06 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 I observe you have created a lot of research materials and taken a lot of photos. Those are long form. 

We need marketing materials created. Are you familiar with such kinds of work? Or do you need some form of structure from me to guide your work?
[5/12/23, 9:47:40 AM] Suheil z: in which exact doc u have this? (srry got too many links from u past days that i got lost what is what hhh)
[5/12/23, 9:48:07 AM] Gary Teh: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WCaenDsfTz5uEiEd19ev0Eyq8dZ0g4exjRhqh93GMjE/edit
[5/12/23, 9:49:10 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 once you are done with the calls, we need your help with webpage designs specifically for EcoVerse21 using materials provided by @13134136108

Once that is done @972509342179 could translate them to webpages 🙂👍
[5/12/23, 10:51:36 AM] Suheil z: guyz i need also to build clean database from scratch for the website
[5/12/23, 10:52:19 AM] Suheil z: the website will handle usernames (with behind all personal info ) in order to also connect to email marketing and stuff from the back later on?
[5/12/23, 11:17:00 AM] Tess walkowski: I need some clarity on what you are thinking.  I do some basic Canva stuff. I wanted to start to play with writing about daos as soon as I finish article about cacao
[5/12/23, 11:17:51 AM] Tess walkowski: I need to see the text  and then yeah if that's done then doing more graphic stuff is simple
[5/12/23, 11:18:05 AM] Tess walkowski: I commissioned a cacao drawing
[5/12/23, 11:38:30 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s keep it simple at first just an informational website
[5/12/23, 11:39:10 AM] Tess walkowski: Or if you want instead more copy language
[5/12/23, 11:41:17 AM] Tess walkowski: I have been planning still to do a write up post about working with this dao
[5/12/23, 11:49:10 AM] Gary Teh: More hi level of why this project came into existence and what we are trying to achieve 

Restoring the social injustice that middle men impose on the producers
[5/12/23, 11:49:18 AM] Gary Teh: Yes please!
‎[5/12/23, 11:50:39 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/12/23, 11:51:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Yeah sure can start it early next week if not sooner
‎[5/12/23, 11:51:42 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/12/23, 11:51:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Wanted to do a simple LinkedIn hello. Have to pull up my dao notes
[5/12/23, 11:51:53 AM] Gary Teh: 750 governance tokens once done 🙂
‎[5/12/23, 11:56:50 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/12/23, 11:57:54 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 and @13134136108 You can reference our white paper for guidance on the pages that need to get created as well as the copy on those pages 

https://TrueSight.me/dao/ecoverse21/whitepaper
[5/12/23, 11:59:08 AM] Gary Teh: While all of you are focused on the online stuff I am focusing my efforts on the offline stuff
[5/12/23, 8:08:05 PM] Anupa/diya: @13134136108 we can set up a call next week to see what exactly needs to go in.
[5/12/23, 8:09:20 PM] Anupa/diya: Will send out an email. Then once they email. ..we can set up a zoom call. However  before we do that.  We should have the website and some information up
[5/12/23, 10:07:30 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/12/23, 10:12:33 PM] Gary Teh: Do indicate on the list the ones you have already reached out to. That way when I work on that same list we won’t overlap and waste effort 

The website is for new financing contributors who want to join as well as new members who are part of networks we can source more produce from. 

That from my perspective is not as high priority as finding the right vendors to work with to get our core supply chain up and running. 

We focus on the core and once the core foundations is established, we work outwards and building out the peripheries.
[5/12/23, 11:11:54 PM] Gary Teh: I am aware that Tiff is connected with a network of indigenous tribes who produce stuff. 

Once we have successfully completed two iterations on our supply chain run, it makes sense to start looking at more sources to pipe through our supply chain 

Iteration 1: cobranding with supplier from Ecuador

Iteration 2: white labeling with Brazilian supplier
[5/13/23, 6:20:59 AM] Francois renet: Hey guys. Just stumbled on this website by chance. Thought I should share.
[5/13/23, 6:21:02 AM] Francois renet: https://global.typica.jp/
[5/13/23, 7:06:22 AM] Francois renet: Sorry I haven’t been able to be super present but working on the latest edition of the magazine which is going to be in a never before seen format :-)
[5/13/23, 7:17:39 AM] Gary Teh: Could be used as reference for setting up the EcoVerse21 website 

@13134136108 and @918017107841
[5/13/23, 7:30:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Do you mean Tess or is there another person working with tribes?

[5/13/23, 8:32:48 AM] Gary Teh: I meant Tiff. She is in the impact investing space and is connected to a network of tribes
[5/13/23, 8:33:34 AM] Gary Teh: I overheard from her the councils of these tribes are starting to explore the idea of impact investing. 

I speculate there might be some synergy if we can prove iteration 1 and 2 of our shipments is actually viable
[5/13/23, 9:56:25 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya this is good. If we do a b 2 b or even story telling narratives this is good. Like Karin said and others. Main thing buyers are looking for is a sutible product and a good story to tell.
[5/13/23, 10:20:55 AM] Tess walkowski: In Brazil?
[5/13/23, 10:21:32 AM] Tess walkowski: That's mainly what I am doing here
[5/13/23, 10:22:05 AM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.
[5/13/23, 12:48:21 PM] Tess walkowski: All of the hapeh I used come Brazil
[5/13/23, 12:48:50 PM] Tess walkowski: And yeah the tribes also are developing interconnect
[5/13/23, 12:49:35 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.
[5/13/23, 12:49:44 PM] Tess walkowski: Arawaken piece
[5/13/23, 3:00:37 PM] Gary Teh: Was with @41765737357 at a dinner where they had a spiritual gathering this whole day. 

They had cacao ceremony in the afternoon 

The supplies were from Peru 

Cacao ceremony really seems like a thing now
[5/13/23, 3:28:42 PM] Tess walkowski: It's a powerful medicine
[5/13/23, 3:28:50 PM] Tess walkowski: And mineral rich
[5/13/23, 3:29:02 PM] Tess walkowski: I think we want to give back!
‎[5/13/23, 3:29:31 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎image omitted
[5/13/23, 3:29:44 PM] Tess walkowski: Can't wait to go to peru
[5/13/23, 3:29:51 PM] Tess walkowski: It all connects
[5/13/23, 3:30:08 PM] Tess walkowski: Ecuador Peru Brazil Colombia
[5/13/23, 3:31:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Stories? Can I send you the cacao hero journey
[5/13/23, 3:32:24 PM] Tess walkowski: I want to start the process to write before I get input. I will use these text threads and feed them in to and look for inspirations here and I have the white paper
[5/13/23, 8:00:34 PM] Anupa/diya: So should we start a separate website for ecoverse. If it's a page or two then it's OK.  If it's more than that
[5/13/23, 8:00:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Then maybe a secondary one
[5/14/23, 12:27:44 AM] Gary Teh: EcoVerse21 should be it’s own website 

Start with two pages

Page one about the overall project 

A second page about the shipment for iteration #1

Once we are ready for our second shipment iteration 2. We create another page for that
[5/14/23, 12:28:31 AM] Gary Teh: The way i see it each new shipment will be its own page 

The page dedicated for the shipment should reflect its status
[5/14/23, 12:29:29 AM] Gary Teh: The contents that @13134136108 comes up with for cacao can be used in the page for iteration #1 which is about cacao shipment

Why cacao of all things
[5/14/23, 5:47:57 AM] Gary Teh: Had lunch with Leyla just now seems the supply of ceremonial cacao here is super expensive
[5/14/23, 6:25:09 AM] Anupa/diya: We need to see where we can find a market for it. Like the tea ceremony which is popularized by Michelin star restuarant with High end tea
[5/14/23, 6:26:04 AM] Anupa/diya: One is the tracking page. There has to be a b 2 b page as well
[5/14/23, 6:27:52 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎You deleted this message as admin
[5/14/23, 7:29:17 AM] Tess walkowski: We may find a market in crypto.   We could make our own cacao ceremony inspired by our values
[5/14/23, 7:30:09 AM] Tess walkowski: https://hukitchen.com/?g_acctid=145-693-4523&g_adgroupid=138817619486&g_adid=616332820261&g_adtype=search&g_campaign=hu_us_search_ecpc_conversion_brand_all&g_campaignid=18035673583&g_keyword=hu%20chocolate&g_keywordid=kwd-331324729855&g_network=g&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwjYKjBhB5EiwAiFdSfsHkGPb7JS1RvABkIUA_3udYu_yUrBMS04zKbRjBz7d0sFFWUP9HqhoCDXMQAvD_BwE
[5/14/23, 7:30:33 AM] Gary Teh: Actually if you know enough hippies or new age folk type, you can always invite them to a cacao ceremony and then have them purchase our imported cacao there
[5/14/23, 7:30:46 AM] Tess walkowski: This company hu, our competitor, just got bought out by mars oreo
[5/14/23, 7:31:26 AM] Tess walkowski: I am a little sick of them lol.
[5/14/23, 7:32:14 AM] Gary Teh: That is what the offline marketing and distribution effort entails 🙂
[5/14/23, 7:32:15 AM] Tess walkowski: But it works.
[5/14/23, 7:32:53 AM] Gary Teh: I saw it done in front of me yesterday at the event that @41765737357 invited me to

It’s exactly what the Ecuador exporter mentioned
[5/14/23, 7:33:55 AM] Gary Teh: You are the only US based shaman in this guild, if you could perform cacao ceremonies to draw in the US based folks for sales then that specific marketing channel might work
[5/14/23, 7:35:05 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/14/23, 7:35:31 AM] Gary Teh: If not then we should not be wasting our time in this guild discussing about that marketing channel until another US based shaman comes along who can execute it
[5/14/23, 7:36:00 AM] Gary Teh: We need to focus our discussion on what is actionable within this chatroom
[5/14/23, 7:39:53 AM] Tess walkowski: I would probably do a Buddhist style ceremony :)
[5/14/23, 7:41:11 AM] Tess walkowski: I was looking at pics of crypto fest tullum....and I was like um where are the Mexicans ?
[5/14/23, 7:42:57 AM] Tess walkowski: My cacao contant Marino would do it too despite not knowing how
[5/14/23, 7:43:26 AM] Tess walkowski: ‎You deleted this message as admin
[5/14/23, 7:43:53 AM] Gary Teh: Just try it. We will extend our tokenomics to award members for performing these cacao ceremonies to draw in the crowd

Also tokenomics for each sale of a bar of cacao
[5/14/23, 7:45:04 AM] Tess walkowski: I can do it for sure.  But I need another pair of hands

[5/14/23, 7:47:20 AM] Gary Teh: 1 hour every morning since 2016
[5/14/23, 7:47:26 AM] Tess walkowski: There are infinite ways to do it.  I'm a singer. I use voice and drums
[5/14/23, 7:47:38 AM] Tess walkowski: Then you know how.
[5/14/23, 7:47:48 AM] Tess walkowski: Adding in sound healing is good.
[5/14/23, 7:47:58 AM] Gary Teh: What does the other pair of hands need to do?
[5/14/23, 7:48:03 AM] Tess walkowski: But like my dj friend says all music is healing
[5/14/23, 7:48:12 AM] Tess walkowski: Hit the drums
[5/14/23, 7:48:17 AM] Tess walkowski: Make a soundscape
[5/14/23, 7:48:38 AM] Tess walkowski: I can also do.
[5/14/23, 7:48:53 AM] Tess walkowski: The ones we have done informal were my favorite
[5/14/23, 7:48:52 AM] Gary Teh: Can you come up with a standard operating procedure for that? 🙂

Put it in a google doc

Let’s bring this thread of discussion offline
[5/14/23, 7:49:46 AM] Tess walkowski: Yes.  We are looking at like 4 articles at this point.   I can add what is a cacao ceremony
[5/14/23, 7:49:50 AM] Gary Teh: The main feedback I get is if the number of post in here gets too long, no one is going to bother reading them so there is almost Zero purpose in posting them here

[5/14/23, 7:57:52 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/14/23, 7:59:40 AM] Anupa/diya: I agree. The details have to be sorted out in a document. The white paper is Still very sketchy.

[5/14/23, 8:08:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/14/23, 8:10:16 AM] Gary Teh: White paper is meant to only provide enough information to potential contributors who are thinking of joining the guild. Nothing more. 

The detailed information on how things work are to be documented here 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKTHiNXfxO9nXs4KBEcmshRKdAapWhVoILjPJQQz-TI/edit

And this should only be accessible to guild members who have signed the noncompete 🙂👍
[5/14/23, 8:27:39 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 are you referring to the pages of content on the EcoVerse21 website which talks about cacao?
[5/14/23, 9:55:55 AM] Tess walkowski: I have access to post docs?
[5/14/23, 9:56:28 AM] Tess walkowski: Is there an active Canva?
[5/14/23, 10:21:56 AM] Gary Teh: Put them in this doc

[5/14/23, 1:09:48 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/14/23, 1:11:04 PM] Gary Teh: The critical path for this project right now is to clear all the legal and logistical hurdles in place to get the 100kg of cacao shipped from Ecuador into our US based warehouse. 

That from my perspective is top priority

All other tasks from my perspective is secondary priority
[5/15/23, 4:24:20 AM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 what were you trying to achieve marketing wise with this post?

[5/15/23, 9:13:49 AM] Tess walkowski: Shipment 3 is criolla
[5/15/23, 9:14:04 AM] Tess walkowski: The best criolla

[5/15/23, 9:41:27 AM] Gary Teh: we leave open. It’s the market that drives what we ship

[5/15/23, 10:49:27 AM] Gary Teh: I am right now reaching out to both suppliers 

Ecuador: check of can package as cacao nibs and cacao powder 

Brazil: check pricing for organic cacao nibs and organic cacao powder
[5/15/23, 10:51:36 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished chat with John whom @972509342179 introduced who will help check what other legal paperwork we need for iteration 1

[5/15/23, 11:04:00 AM] Gary Teh: Was chatting with Fatima just now who emphasized the need for a proper quality control process before the goods get shipped out from the sources

We might need to find ourselves a professional cacao assessor if there is even such a profile
[5/15/23, 11:38:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Where did we generate this report?
[5/15/23, 11:39:27 AM] Tess walkowski: I mean that's what I feel too, I know criolla, and how it tastes but also it's fermented a way and processes in a way that is not on market....
[5/15/23, 11:40:08 AM] Tess walkowski: So....criolla also rarely hits commodities market where the other cacao goes....yes there are criolla hunters
[5/15/23, 11:40:36 AM] Tess walkowski: Without tasting that Ecuadorian cacao I won't know....
[5/15/23, 3:08:53 PM] Gary Teh: It’s in this link

[5/15/23, 3:12:32 PM] Tess walkowski: "cacao beans" "cacao"
[5/15/23, 3:12:43 PM] Tess walkowski: These have sub categories
[5/15/23, 3:14:33 PM] Tess walkowski: .....my research is leading me to believe that the so called nationale is actually really close to criolla.... Genetically

[5/15/23, 4:26:51 PM] Gary Teh: There are lots of market place analytics solution for Amazon.com out there

Most are not free. Like the ones I am using zoof and jungle scout. They cost USD50 a month
[5/15/23, 4:28:06 PM] Gary Teh: Brazilian coop came back with their price for organic cacao nibs. They don’t make powder using organic cacao nibs 

Still waiting for Ecuador side to respond about the possibility of nibs and powder
[5/15/23, 4:29:09 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.

[5/15/23, 4:30:04 PM] Tess walkowski: To be "organic" is bs
[5/15/23, 4:30:34 PM] Tess walkowski: Nibs are crushed roasted bean
[5/15/23, 4:30:53 PM] Tess walkowski: I think targeting keto is GREAT

‎[5/15/23, 4:31:58 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/15/23, 4:32:02 PM] Tess walkowski: To retain quality we would want to import the bean
[5/15/23, 4:32:46 PM] Gary Teh: Processing in the US is expensive. I doubt you can be processing an entire ton by hands
[5/15/23, 4:33:07 PM] Tess walkowski: Heard.
[5/15/23, 4:33:26 PM] Tess walkowski: Nibs are crushed bean. I need it in solid for what I do....
[5/15/23, 4:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: If you want to you can come join me when I meet the coop President at a later date
[5/15/23, 4:33:48 PM] Tess walkowski: Of where
[5/15/23, 4:33:56 PM] Gary Teh: Northern Brazil
[5/15/23, 4:34:16 PM] Tess walkowski: Can't wait!
[5/15/23, 4:34:32 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s hold off discussion about this till after we are done with iteration 2.
[5/15/23, 4:34:44 PM] Gary Teh: I am planning to be there next week
[5/15/23, 4:36:15 PM] Tess walkowski: Sure but I'm personalty not waiting. I'm prototyping asap.   I love cacao and I'm cacao drunk right now from eating 200g raw fresh.
[5/15/23, 4:36:35 PM] Tess walkowski: Nibs are fine too, it's the same in a way
[5/15/23, 4:38:05 PM] Gary Teh: Sure. Go ahead with the RnD. 

Just remember we go where the market is. And everything needs to be ran by numbers at scale.
[5/15/23, 4:38:45 PM] Tess walkowski: What's the closest city?
[5/15/23, 4:39:57 PM] Gary Teh: Meet me in Salvador

From there we will need to head to itacare where the cooperative is

How familiar are you with sampling the quality of cacaos? 

Fatima mentioned the need to first test the quality of the cacao by manually sampling?
[5/15/23, 4:40:01 PM] Tess walkowski: My own sustainable here or USA is dependant on my skills and knowledge as a cuadera.... One who knows the knowledge of fruit and plants and loves to share it
[5/15/23, 4:41:18 PM] Gary Teh: What is a cuadera?
[5/15/23, 4:42:06 PM] Tess walkowski: A word for shaman I feel better with
[5/15/23, 4:42:15 PM] Tess walkowski: A "curer" in a way
[5/15/23, 4:43:13 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 Bump

I am right now maki by arrangements
[5/15/23, 4:43:44 PM] Tess walkowski: The flight is close to $700 it's high for me, I do have things I study close to that region
[5/15/23, 4:44:54 PM] Tess walkowski: How far is that from the Amazon?
[5/15/23, 4:46:01 PM] Gary Teh: It’s a days driving from the Amazon
‎[5/15/23, 4:46:05 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/15/23, 4:51:19 PM] Tess walkowski: Flight price is high I checked and routes through Bogota
[5/15/23, 4:53:51 PM] Tess walkowski: I don't think it's the most frugal choice for me to go right now
[5/15/23, 4:54:29 PM] Tess walkowski: I will Finnish my study in Brazil.....
[5/15/23, 4:55:33 PM] Tess walkowski: Unless the dao invited me, but that's also not frugal.   I could talk you through what to taste for.
[5/15/23, 4:56:24 PM] Tess walkowski: But if our target is keto
[5/15/23, 4:56:47 PM] Tess walkowski: Nutritional testing also plays a roll in a way
[5/15/23, 4:56:56 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. Please do so privately via our DM or write them in this document 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pcoBTENUff6rYypaR6Xl0DbLMZUqjt1C3xBkvQecoQ/edit
[5/15/23, 4:57:23 PM] Gary Teh: We need to test the raw output itself is of good quality
[5/15/23, 4:57:59 PM] Tess walkowski: Any chance you drink red wine. Napas and stuff?
[5/15/23, 4:58:07 PM] Tess walkowski: That's my best analogy
[5/15/23, 4:58:29 PM] Tess walkowski: I used to pour very expensive stuff. Same quality. Tannic.
[5/15/23, 4:58:40 PM] Tess walkowski: Tannic. Cacao. Red wine.
[5/15/23, 5:00:42 PM] Tess walkowski: ‎This message was deleted.
[5/15/23, 5:23:26 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 keep
Me posted on the status of the import brokers. 

Game plan tomorrow 
——
1. I will source for another twenty tomorrow. 

2. Reach out the USFDA vendors shortlisted
[5/15/23, 5:24:40 PM] Tess walkowski: Cadmium is a contamination issue in farmed cacao which some consumers may have consurns about
[5/15/23, 5:29:43 PM] Gary Teh: Are there certifications for that?
[5/15/23, 5:37:04 PM] Tess walkowski: I am sure there is something we must need to list on Amazon
[5/15/23, 5:38:40 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s not assume. Amazon has a very specific set of requirements. And they are listed on the site 

Would you like to oversee the certification process for listing our cacao on Amazon?
[5/15/23, 5:40:19 PM] Tess walkowski: Id like to know what they are.
[5/15/23, 5:40:47 PM] Tess walkowski: I think I want to focus on the writing and ceremonies and content
[5/15/23, 5:41:33 PM] Tess walkowski: I'd like to see us become an Amazon but sold through daos
[5/15/23, 5:41:38 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/15/23, 5:43:13 PM] Gary Teh: Ok then. You belong in the content marketing department 

Please go figure out what your process is, your cadence, the metric you plan to hit and then share it with us

Examples for metric might include 

    - how many articles you plan to write per month
    - how many eye balls you plan to capture
    - how many visitors you plan to drive to our Amazon listing once it’s ready
[5/15/23, 5:43:42 PM] Tess walkowski: I want to know how it works, but if I am in charge of it and writing it's too much.
[5/15/23, 5:44:19 PM] Gary Teh: I thought you have unvolunteered yourself for Amazon logistics concerns?
[5/15/23, 5:44:43 PM] Gary Teh: Just focus on content generation / aka writing
[5/15/23, 5:44:49 PM] Tess walkowski: I have to know what our cacao is and what it's story it is to sell it
[5/15/23, 5:45:27 PM] Gary Teh: What are some parameters you need for story telling purposes?

Let me go get those materials for you from the suppliers
[5/15/23, 5:47:19 PM] Gary Teh: Also since you are focus on the story telling part and actively posting them you will need to start tracking and then optimizing the performance of the post you are creating on social media. Aka ones like these 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7063562844767727616--4rj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios

Everything is simply governed by metrics
[5/15/23, 5:55:24 PM] Tess walkowski: I need criolla from this region for my ceremonies. For me the story starts here and travels through Ecuador
[5/15/23, 5:55:57 PM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is a spirit.
[5/15/23, 5:56:25 PM] Tess walkowski: The story is told of the travel of the tree.
[5/15/23, 5:57:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Nationale seems to fit the narrative of this
[5/15/23, 5:58:01 PM] Tess walkowski: Of course Seo drives traffic and if we target keto I'll happily write a keto article to drive traffic if that's what product market fit dictates
[5/15/23, 5:58:38 PM] Tess walkowski: Then I post it from the channel.  Metrics are clearer
[5/15/23, 5:58:50 PM] Tess walkowski: And we learn what works via analysis
[5/15/23, 6:00:17 PM] Gary Teh: Sounds to me like you have in mind a content marketing campaign where you write a series of post about the history of the cacao. 

I believe Keto target market segment might be more accessible via the Instagram marketing channel 

I believe the Therapeutic/depression cacao ceremony market segment belongs more on LinkedIn where the professionals are
[5/15/23, 6:00:30 PM] Tess walkowski: I don't want to sell cacao that is not ethically harvested from origin beans which have a story.   Your Ecuador contact has a story. For this story I would want to know about botany and genetics of the tree growing regions etc fermentation process
[5/15/23, 6:01:28 PM] Gary Teh: Let me ask the Ecuador supplier for more marketing materials
[5/15/23, 6:01:52 PM] Tess walkowski: I write neutral to begin.   Like national geographic.  All can be reworked that I write.
[5/15/23, 6:02:22 PM] Tess walkowski: I am not an Seo expert.  But I see quickly in my research that Seo drives sales
[5/15/23, 6:02:48 PM] Gary Teh: Just Forget about SEO 

Focus on Instagram and LinkedIn marketing
[5/15/23, 6:02:53 PM] Tess walkowski: This related to "verifiable truth"
[5/15/23, 6:03:28 PM] Tess walkowski: It's verifiable truth that theobromine was found in pots in Ecuador
[5/15/23, 6:03:34 PM] Tess walkowski: 5000 years ago.
[5/15/23, 6:33:30 PM] Gary Teh: What will be helpful now will be to identify more channels where we can reach market segment #1 and #2
[5/15/23, 6:34:45 PM] Tess walkowski: Is the LinkedIn channel a good place to try ?
[5/15/23, 6:35:07 PM] Tess walkowski: Repost the one I wrote .... Try more ..
[5/15/23, 6:35:15 PM] Gary Teh: Just craft your contents and try it. Reach out to Aga to get help if you are familiar with her
[5/15/23, 6:35:58 PM] Tess walkowski: I can knock out a keto article quick.... And those are in my portfolio on medium anywhere just don't know where to post
[5/15/23, 6:36:21 PM] Tess walkowski: ....we also have ai on our side .. articles write simple....
[5/15/23, 6:36:23 PM] Gary Teh: She is really good at organizing crowds to drive up viewership rates of LinkedIn post 

However I would only activate marketing once we have brought our shipment in otherwise you spend all the efforts at marketing but there is nothing to sell
[5/15/23, 6:37:27 PM] Tess walkowski: Then maybe we pm.   We have access both to the metricsa and she is welcome to work with what I write.
[5/15/23, 6:37:36 PM] Gary Teh: Spend time on crafting a library of bite size contents that could be posted
[5/15/23, 6:40:13 PM] Anupa/diya: I have added the names of the people from LinkedIn who we can approach
[5/15/23, 6:49:06 PM] Gary Teh: Can you indicate the ones you have already approached?
[5/15/23, 6:53:39 PM] Anupa/diya: Ya I have contacted two people via LinkedIn
[5/15/23, 6:54:14 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 this is the website of the Ecuador supplier we are getting our first shipment of cacao from 

https://cacaoamor.com/

See if the contents displayed there are useful and let me know if there are contents you need that is not available. 

I will reach out to ask for them
[5/15/23, 6:54:51 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps mark their names in green 

That way I know when I look at the google sheet
[5/15/23, 6:55:02 PM] Anupa/diya: I have noticed that there are these networking paid websites to find resources for the agro Industrt
[5/15/23, 6:55:10 PM] Anupa/diya: Should we look into them .
[5/15/23, 6:55:51 PM] Gary Teh: Probably alittle too early. Have you tried contact them directly on their website?
[5/15/23, 6:55:53 PM] Anupa/diya: To find people . One can connect us to the other
[5/15/23, 6:56:40 PM] Anupa/diya: The info will only be available once you pay.
‎[5/15/23, 6:56:41 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/15/23, 6:57:02 PM] Anupa/diya: Yes. I think it will be good.
[5/15/23, 6:57:25 PM] Gary Teh: Doesn’t make sense 

I personally would just call the numbers listed on the website of the import brokers and start the conversation
[5/15/23, 6:57:30 PM] Anupa/diya: @972509342179 you can join in so we can just finalize the website
[5/15/23, 6:58:15 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[5/15/23, 6:59:15 PM] Anupa/diya: I also feel we should see in the DAO if we have anyone who is interested in sales and lead generation

[5/15/23, 6:59:33 PM] Anupa/diya: If we can manage this. That's awesome.
[5/15/23, 6:59:59 PM] Anupa/diya: If we will need someone who can be dedicated towards.
[5/15/23, 7:00:02 PM] Gary Teh: I have been just copying the contact information from google maps
[5/15/23, 7:00:16 PM] Gary Teh: We should update our white paper for this role

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit
[5/15/23, 7:00:28 PM] Anupa/diya: Ya.
[5/15/23, 7:01:01 PM] Anupa/diya: Can we put it up on townhall.. this is not really industry specific
[5/15/23, 7:01:10 PM] Gary Teh: And then once the Main site that @972509342179 is preparing is ready include that role there
[5/15/23, 7:01:20 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.

[5/15/23, 7:02:34 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 I don’t see why You are going the round about way?

There are tons of these import broker companies that could be found on google map
[5/15/23, 7:02:55 PM] Tess walkowski: That looks great
[5/15/23, 7:03:48 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 don’t get distracted

You need to focus on what more marketing content you need from the supplier.

I notice you have this ADHD tendency
[5/15/23, 7:04:03 PM] Tess walkowski: Let's go to a pm
[5/15/23, 7:04:44 PM] Anupa/diya: Then we can direct people to it.
[5/15/23, 7:04:44 PM] Anupa/diya: I feel roles can be divided between Dao and no  DAO. As incentivsation is a driver. Dao members can be paid in tokenns and others in fiat.
[5/15/23, 7:06:02 PM] Anupa/diya: Ya let's meet @13134136108 . I am free normally after 9 pm ist.
[5/15/23, 7:06:49 PM] Anupa/diya: We can look at Thursday.  If this works for you @972509342179 are you ok with this
[5/15/23, 7:10:16 PM] Gary Teh: Just think of DAo members as shareholders in your company
[5/15/23, 7:12:22 PM] Gary Teh: I am having a meeting on Thursday with the lawyers from Lawyers4Web3 that Anita has made arrangements with. 

High level agenda
———
- discuss the 4 legal documents we have already created using ChatGpt

- discuss legal structure for TrueSight DAo within the Swiss jurisdiction
[5/15/23, 7:37:16 PM] Tess walkowski: I am on Bogota time I think we are flipped but let aim for Thursday other wise we can try voice notes on what's app
[5/15/23, 7:40:32 PM] Anupa/diya: We can do 9 AM India time which your 10 30 pm Bogota time

[5/16/23, 2:55:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Keto is more popular and has a global market
[5/16/23, 2:55:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Ceremonial coffee is more niche and can be sold as a bespoke experience
[5/16/23, 2:58:50 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s vote one. It’s about prioritization
[5/16/23, 3:33:14 AM] Gary Teh: I believe we will end up with execution problems if we go down this route for iteration one. 

reasons
   - who runs the experience? 
    - who drives the marketing execution?
    - it is going to end up being a much larger scope than a small quick experiment
[5/16/23, 3:33:31 AM] Gary Teh: Bump

[5/16/23, 6:38:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Are we going with Amazon primary because of the warehousing

Plus they also have a lot of experience importing perishables into the Bay Area.

[5/16/23, 1:21:52 PM] Gary Teh: Done for the day. 

Personal action plan for tomorrow:
    1. - follow up with a specialist consultant on FDA registration for our US legal entity
    2. - look into getting our DUNS number for becoming an importer
    3. - finalized the packaging portion of the marketing 4Ps for shipment 2. How many ounces for each bag of nibs. Based on the quantitative research data gathered
[5/16/23, 1:22:31 PM] Suheil z: u still need design for our own packaging or later ?
[5/16/23, 1:22:37 PM] Suheil z: or done .

[5/16/23, 1:24:04 PM] Gary Teh: These are the other things we need for packaging
    - We need to decide on a name for our cacao brand (shipment 2) 
    - decide on the logo

The designer in Bahia is waiting for this
[5/16/23, 1:24:11 PM] Gary Teh: not done
[5/16/23, 1:24:36 PM] Suheil z: iif u have designer ready then cool
[5/16/23, 1:25:12 PM] Gary Teh: Can we get a designer to come up with the logo? The designer we are speaking to is only focused on designed the cacao container package.
[5/16/23, 1:41:09 PM] Tess walkowski: What do we want on our logo ?
[5/16/23, 2:19:39 PM] Gary Teh: Hand of god or something thing along that lines 

You gonna do it??

[5/16/23, 3:48:57 PM] Suheil z: this friend cant design full branding? if he /she has artistic skills it should be simple with all ai's out there, just need talented brains to send correct inputs for ai to generate full branding material to cacao brand ,  i can assist in that..
[5/16/23, 4:12:34 PM] Tess walkowski: I see in my eye a bit a simple hand outside with an eye in the middle

[5/17/23, 1:58:38 AM] Anupa/diya: ECOVIBES 
ECOVERSE

We have to see if these are all registered products
[5/17/23, 1:59:01 AM] Anupa/diya: We can keep it as ecoverse
[5/17/23, 2:01:51 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. I think EcoVerse itself makes sense 

This is especially because we have plans to be minting NFTs later on. And this tokenization of physical real world object on chain is a variant of the metaverse (not VR) 

And EcoVerse itself resonates very clearly that it’s to do with nature and the indigenous along with it
[5/17/23, 2:31:07 AM] Anupa/diya: If we have multiple brand names and product names it just gets diffused
[5/17/23, 2:31:08 AM] Anupa/diya: I don't know how the licensing works because in India, for every license one needs to pay

[5/17/23, 2:51:12 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just stick to Ecoverse

Dalle to reduce the work of graphic designers in our DAO

[5/17/23, 3:04:16 AM] Anupa/diya: Someone will still have to put the packaging in a dieline format for the printer
[5/17/23, 3:05:08 AM] Anupa/diya: The product photography can't be ai outsourced because we will have to show the actual product

[5/17/23, 4:32:31 AM] Gary Teh: Yes the mother foundation that is the lingering task item. 

I am chatting with the lawyers from Lawyers4Web3 this Thursday which Anita has kindly helped setup

Would you be keen to join the call too. 

On top of walking through the 4 legal docs we created using ChatGpt, We should hopefully get to discuss about the incorporation of the mother foundation with them too

The mother foundation does feel more rightly to be an NGO
[5/17/23, 4:33:04 AM] Suheil z: you can always count me in for any call

[5/17/23, 6:46:08 AM] Tess walkowski: I need to draw cacao myself at some point.
[5/17/23, 6:48:57 AM] Tess walkowski: .none of the above.   I'll make you a jungle bite.   I think I prefer ECOVERSE CACAO NIBS or TRUE SIGHT CACAO NIBS
[5/17/23, 6:55:44 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s do EcoVerse cacao nibs then
[5/17/23, 6:57:13 AM] Tess walkowski: Ecoverse makes me think of captin planet

[5/17/23, 8:38:16 AM] Gary Teh: Sometimes it’s better to just make a judgmental call based on gut feeling and then just go ahead. 

A lot of times the time spent deliberating might be even more than the time spent executing on the options and getting the data back
[5/17/23, 8:39:01 AM] Tess walkowski: Try 8

[5/17/23, 8:40:06 AM] Tess walkowski: Done
[5/17/23, 10:55:37 AM] Gary Teh: The verdict seems clear. Let's get a poll from the larger DAO on which state to incorporate in. 

ChatGpt has suggested the following:

1. Delaware: Delaware is a popular choice for incorporating businesses due to its well-established corporate law structure, business-friendly regulations, and specialized courts, such as the Court of Chancery, which handles corporate disputes. Delaware offers favorable tax laws for businesses and has a strong legal framework that provides clarity and predictability.

2. Nevada: Nevada is known for its business-friendly environment, including minimal reporting requirements, no state corporate income tax, and no personal income tax. It also provides strong asset protection laws, making it an attractive option for businesses.

3. Wyoming: Wyoming is another state with business-friendly regulations and low taxes. It offers advantages such as no state corporate income tax, low annual fees, strong privacy protections, and a simplified reporting process.

4. New Mexico: New Mexico is gaining popularity as a favorable state for LLC incorporation due to its low filing fees, no franchise tax, and a straightforward business formation process. It also offers a business-friendly environment and favorable tax laws.

5. Texas: Texas is known for its pro-business environment and has no personal income tax or state corporate income tax. It offers a favorable regulatory climate, access to a large market, and a strong economy.

It's essential to consult with a legal and tax professional or an incorporation service to assess your specific business needs and determine the best state for incorporating your LLC as an importer.

1. FDA consultant found. 
2. Once we figure out our LLC we can get a DUNS number
3.  We have finalized this
[5/17/23, 12:28:29 PM] Suheil z: @14153000019  we shall not involve the DAO concept into american based LLC's entities , huge risk and the americans are not shownig us any good siign for near future... untill now EU has been the pioneer in  terms of legal acceptance in what concerns DAO blockchaiini web3 ect ect ect...
[5/17/23, 12:34:43 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 

Let’s just have our guild members form the US based LLC then.
[5/17/23, 12:37:37 PM] Suheil z: it will not differ much, the moment u start as independent LLC you will loose 40% of your reessources on taxation issues, let's build it right from scratch and set up thee elephant in the room--> foundation ... foundation in switzerland or vienna would make our life much easier for any projeect we want to develop further ....  i dont know if you arre famiiliiar with open AI foundation concept... have a look at it if not u will geet it fast and lets just follow, it got proven allready as best model
[5/17/23, 12:37:41 PM] Suheil z: until today
[5/17/23, 12:40:33 PM] Suheil z: i really should learn to write more proper english and use more commas in my sentences hhh srry if its too messy
[5/17/23, 12:42:58 PM] Gary Teh: We will still need a US based LLC to import our cacao 

I think the whole Switzerland foundation can come later 

By the time we finish setting up and paying all the legal feels for the Switzerland foundation there will be no more money left in the vault for the LLC to borrow. 

The LLc might as well go somewhere else for financing in the first place 🤣
[5/17/23, 12:43:48 PM] Suheil z: yessss but llc under moother foundation iis waaay different ... but ya i iget ur point
[5/17/23, 12:43:58 PM] Gary Teh: And if we are selling in the US, we will be paying US tax anyways
[5/17/23, 12:44:54 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s just go ahead and set it up independently of the DAO 

We will figure out how to account for the financing provided by the DAO on the books of the LLC
[5/17/23, 12:44:57 PM] Suheil z: nop when llc is owned by mother foundation all revenue go to mother foundation and local llc will never make taxable profit ... and income tax will always get zero'ed with expenses
[5/17/23, 12:45:19 PM] Suheil z: llsn lsn i suggest for this piilot mvp ect just do it by yourself or pick up couple of other members that u personally trust
[5/17/23, 12:48:57 PM] Gary Teh: Are you also suggesting to not involve anyone from the guild too?
[5/17/23, 12:51:23 PM] Suheil z: not not involve in all this, i just mean that anyways all this what we are doing together, will function only based of trust... so invovle everyone here on whatsapp , on goveernance on decision making but on papers unfortunately not feasible yet..  per example i trust u personally , i talk to u here we take decisions here i care the less about "how to " perform it on papers to satisfy those m...f$%#erks politicians , just that with governments we need to be ultra smart (not right) then between us we figure it out all :)
[5/17/23, 12:53:29 PM] Gary Teh: Ok then, members will really need to trust that all their efforts contributed to EcoVerse21 in exchange for DAO governance tokens will be worth something 

And that trust will be based on the fact that I do not renegade after taking the funds from the DAO to finance the first shipment via the LLC I incorporated just in my name
[5/17/23, 12:54:32 PM] Suheil z: look at the group everyone waas"sleeping" now that u brought up serious project suddenly i heard new voices(on me ) ... what i want to osay by that... now that we reach serious moments , we build serious governance voting ...
[5/17/23, 12:54:57 PM] Suheil z: so we wiilll continue discussing there with all and lets handle it whiile giving all of them the voting power
[5/17/23, 12:55:24 PM] Suheil z: lsn llsn right now i need to run srry i will continue with u later tonight

[5/17/23, 8:20:28 PM] Tess walkowski: That's powder not bar
[5/17/23, 8:22:26 PM] Tess walkowski: That product claims a lot :)
[5/17/23, 8:27:41 PM] Tess walkowski: That price is low.
[5/17/23, 8:28:12 PM] Tess walkowski: I found the cubes on their website.   It's Peruvian. Criolla 19.99
[5/17/23, 8:32:07 PM] Tess walkowski: https://www.vivapura.com/categories/shop/2345576000000592133
[5/17/23, 8:33:57 PM] Gary Teh: Profit margin is going to be challenging with these guys driving down the price
[5/17/23, 8:34:52 PM] Tess walkowski: Let's name 2-5 competitors
[5/17/23, 8:35:45 PM] Tess walkowski: It looks like they must be going to Peru and buying the lowest criolla they can get and repeat
[5/17/23, 8:37:03 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 

Three competitors in the ceremonial space that have their produce available on Amazon 

See how what they are advertising about their product that is different from other competitors 

Check through the comments of people leaving the reviews to see what the buyers really care about

That will help us figure how to position differently and not just compete on price 

We will die that way
[5/17/23, 8:37:22 PM] Tess walkowski: But we managed cheaper nips
[5/17/23, 8:37:54 PM] Tess walkowski: And from that info we choose our logo name etc.
[5/17/23, 8:38:20 PM] Tess walkowski: Go to their website see their store
[5/17/23, 8:40:47 PM] Tess walkowski: And im going to check where the arhuaca with an nit (Colombian export licence)  is , they were charged  $22 a kilo when I went
[5/17/23, 8:42:10 PM] Gary Teh: What is an arhuaca again? Factory
[5/17/23, 8:42:35 PM] Tess walkowski: One of the four tayrona people
[5/17/23, 8:43:04 PM] Tess walkowski: The one I have is wild grown criolla.
[5/17/23, 8:43:28 PM] Tess walkowski: The fermentation of cacao is very very complex and methods change flavors

Both me and Val are directors

He has a larger share holding in it than me.

Whenever we spend 1 USD money for expenses in TrueTech Inc, the expense we are issued 1 share 

The expense is notarized on TrueSight DAO ledger. The governance token is issued to TrueTech Inc.
[5/18/23, 5:19:15 AM] Anupa/diya: In that case, should we just sound him about what going to happen

[5/18/23, 5:37:28 AM] Gary Teh: 3 boards

[5/18/23, 5:38:15 AM] Anupa/diya: The 3 board at times gets automatically closed if you try to create a 4th board so technically its only 2.
[5/18/23, 5:38:37 AM] Anupa/diya: There is no pressure. If we feel we need it, we can go for it
[5/18/23, 5:39:16 AM] Gary Teh: Just go for the free trial. If it does bring value we can consider later on for upgrade

[5/18/23, 5:40:10 AM] Anupa/diya: Its similar as miro which we have already used.

[5/18/23, 6:03:58 AM] Suheil z: if u need to prepare plans use mural or monday iit would be much easier for you and for us :D
[5/18/23, 6:04:06 AM] Anupa/diya: There is no point doing the free version if we are not going forward.
[5/18/23, 6:04:24 AM] Gary Teh: Sure that works too.
[5/18/23, 6:04:35 AM] Gary Teh: How do you define going forward?
[5/18/23, 6:05:08 AM] Suheil z: ii can disagree a bit with you , we need to try and if it works fine then we continue
[5/18/23, 6:05:29 AM] Suheil z: and even if wee realized that its not fine enough we can export files of work already done on it

[5/18/23, 6:20:33 AM] Anupa/diya: I am sure. I have used it for my work plentiful so I know it's capacities and how it can be used. I unfortunately donot gave the time to spend on trials. If you want please go ahead and explore and then we can decide
[5/18/23, 6:25:35 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. That is on my action plan today after my meetings in the morning 

Fatima was hounding about it yesterday
[5/18/23, 6:28:05 AM] Gary Teh: My goal is to understand where the gap is in the market segments we are going for

I will be looking at key benefits Sellers use to incentivize sales to customers 

Where they are positioned in the market segment and how large those positions are.

SMART goals should be more Macro

[5/19/23, 8:00:02 AM] Gary Teh: Following up now 

1) to make sure the packaging for Ecuador passes FDA standard requirements 

2) getting paperwork from Brazil side for FDA registration
[5/19/23, 9:58:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Where I would initially say we are stronger in story.   Depending on margins we have in end.   This is ethical cacao made with love.   Our other competitor is a small business.    But if someone sees another solid chocolate bar on Amazon cacao screenshot it please so I can look.
[5/19/23, 9:59:32 AM] Tess walkowski: The bar available has a strong story.   They are a small company like us and they are succeeding.
[5/19/23, 10:00:27 AM] Tess walkowski: There is much competition.  So we want to look at people who help us learn about ourselves
[5/19/23, 10:01:12 AM] Tess walkowski: My own bars of criolla which is very small scale is going on Etsy with a high price bc I only sell 5 kilo :)
[5/19/23, 10:01:40 AM] Tess walkowski: Probably $111
[5/19/23, 10:02:19 AM] Tess walkowski: And I am going to look for the other company our competitor physically and hope to say hi
[5/19/23, 10:04:07 AM] Tess walkowski: We could look at companies like nestle as competitor as well or anylze hu a chocolate company.  But I would love other input!
[5/19/23, 10:10:14 AM] Anupa/diya: Do we have the guidelines that go in to the packaging

[5/19/23, 10:47:03 AM] Anupa/diya: 👍👍
[5/19/23, 11:05:29 AM] Gary Teh: By the way, Alessandro mentions his wife might be able to help with logo design

[5/19/23, 11:12:13 AM] Suheil z: i would wait a bit as i found a girl who is X nike designer NFT's and she told me to continue discussing that she join officially and take care of all design related matters , specially for future NFT project :)
[5/19/23, 11:15:32 AM] Suheil z: adding to my personal opinion, that we shouldnt divide the requirements of design. 1 designer should prepare all branding material , not efficient and very costly if we divide it by parts :ii mean iif 1 designer today makes only logo, then tomorrow we will need someone to make the bags or the packagiing or branding book , branding identity ect ect ect...
[5/19/23, 11:16:32 AM] Gary Teh: That would be wonderful! 🥰
[5/19/23, 11:19:45 AM] Gary Teh: When can she confirm?
[5/19/23, 11:24:31 AM] Suheil z: its not about confirmation iits about building relationshiip btw DAO and her, btw me and her iits already buiilt and we have been friends since a while hhhh
[5/19/23, 11:25:09 AM] Gary Teh: I see. Got it. Perhaps while we continue building relationship with her, let's just go ahead with Alessandro's proposal
[5/19/23, 11:25:33 AM] Gary Teh: We need to decouple the recruitment from the operations otherwise forward momentum will slow donw
[5/19/23, 11:27:10 AM] Gary Teh: Forward momentum within our projects will naturally attract more members to want to participate
[5/19/23, 11:44:51 AM] Tess walkowski: I see market distinction right there
[5/19/23, 11:45:30 AM] Tess walkowski: I like tree to block.
[5/19/23, 12:02:11 PM] Tess walkowski: I think also once we determine what makes us different we will know what designer we want.
[5/19/23, 12:02:47 PM] Gary Teh: @972509342179 am in the meeting
‎[5/19/23, 1:03:35 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[5/19/23, 7:16:42 PM] Anupa/diya: The scope of design related is huge whether is service, product, brand, graphic and so on. As it is a collab effort, she can join to develop at any point. I agree let's go ahead with Alessandro  s proposal as they are ready.
[5/19/23, 7:17:45 PM] Anupa/diya: This person can join the beer hall for now and see how they feel about the DAO.

[5/20/23, 6:53:38 AM] Tess walkowski: There is a central place where all this is right?
[5/20/23, 6:54:16 AM] Tess walkowski: Agree with Fatima
[5/20/23, 6:54:54 AM] Gary Teh: It is all in the Google drive folder that's been shared with you.

[5/21/23, 8:33:00 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s try to pick out recurring objective and subjective keyword they used to describe their consumption experience
[5/21/23, 8:34:06 AM] Tess walkowski: I challenge everyone in this group to eat 200g of ceremonial cacao
[5/21/23, 8:34:12 AM] Gary Teh: Those we use for listing
[5/21/23, 8:34:55 AM] Tess walkowski: There are a lot of trade groups.  I'll look for more cacao groups.

[5/21/23, 8:36:31 AM] Gary Teh: There might be some profit to be had if we could quickly source for the supplies

Am checking the order quantity from the buyer now
[5/21/23, 8:39:00 AM] Tess walkowski: I have a contact from way back who did Bogota to China
[5/21/23, 8:39:10 AM] Tess walkowski: I could reach out
[5/21/23, 8:39:37 AM] Tess walkowski: The major thing is what we are doing learning about trade and getting permission
[5/21/23, 8:49:12 AM] Gary Teh: We will end up breaking into the market after this process
[5/21/23, 9:09:10 AM] Suheil z: guyz u modified sthn iin upcoming meeting ?
[5/21/23, 9:29:43 AM] Gary Teh: I added the agenda 

FaceTime meetings should very directed and have clear agenda for maximum productivity 🙂

Otherwise half the time is wasted figuring out what the agenda is
[5/21/23, 10:40:20 AM] Suheil z: sure sure just thought time or date got modiified

[5/22/23, 3:46:59 AM] Gary Teh: As I dive more deeply into this space I am started to observe simultaneously positioning our brand for two market segments will be tricky 

At this point, I am almost feeling inclined to drop the ceremonial cacao market segment since the disruption channels are not as easily accessible and the sales volume of those we have direct access to are too small for me to personally feel confident we will be able to unload our entire inventory

[5/22/23, 9:26:39 AM] Tess walkowski: I think ceremonial is niche and not main stream.   Just think we struggle with margins with who we work with. ( It's higher quality the Ecuadorian stuff)
[5/22/23, 9:28:14 AM] Gary Teh: Need to consider these two parameters
    - profit margin per unit
    - inventory turn around time

The higher the profit margin, the faster the turn around time of our inventory the more efficient our capital deployed

concluded our call that , we prepare our ecoverse base story (which will be based on all marketing material all team prepared) --> for that i opened file called the story with ready layout / structure how to build the ecoverse story. 

when we have base story well formulated, we will then build up strategies of story telling adapting to each different platform ( per example the instagram one will be slightly different than the lined in one).

as per each channel will need to identify the difference between audience and set up the atmosphere accordinggly

[5/30/23, 8:22:28 PM] Anupa/diya: Let me look into the process
[5/30/23, 8:25:47 PM] Anupa/diya: In India, there is this system on Amazon. If you buy a product which later you would like customised like a mug and you want to add a photo to it. The number of the seller is there on Amazon and you can contact them separately with the invoice from Amazon

[6/7/23, 1:17:19 PM] Tess walkowski: 1)   Aricle Bahia complex 1000 - 1500 words ( use for whatever website etc)   2) Text for cacao package pack about process of growing/story special 3)amazon seller text    4) make keto copy shine
[6/7/23, 1:19:04 PM] Tess walkowski: Yes!    I think visually.      I feel like I would put a few versions of package text in visual

[6/7/23, 3:55:58 PM] Tess walkowski: The Cabruca method of farming is a sustainable farming method that is often used in Bahia for cacao cultivation. This method involves planting cacao trees in the shade of other trees, such as the native rainforest trees, rather than in direct sunlight. This helps to preserve the rainforest while also providing a sustainable way to cultivate cacao. The method is named after the traditional agroforestry system of the Tupi-Guarani indigenous people, who used it to cultivate cacao and other crops. The Cabruca method has been shown to be effective in preserving biodiversity and soil quality in Bahia's cacao plantations.

Just call them cooperatives of small scale marginalized farmers based in Brazil
[6/11/23, 10:24:34 AM] Tess walkowski: The longer form helps alot, takes longer to right, but its powerful and becomes a base of knowledge to best on.     Package copy is playfully being written and rewritten with visible experiments.
[6/11/23, 10:24:42 AM] Gary Teh: I am right now also talking to the Ecuador folks
[6/11/23, 10:24:47 AM] Tess walkowski: I will invent a place holder
[6/11/23, 10:25:06 AM] Tess walkowski: writing a few different ways.   both take time.

[6/11/23, 10:25:35 AM] Gary Teh: All of them using cabruca method
[6/11/23, 10:25:43 AM] Tess walkowski: I need cheaper product high quality.    I will sell.
[6/11/23, 10:25:50 AM] Tess walkowski: cabruca is similar to here
[6/11/23, 10:26:15 AM] Tess walkowski: this is a discussion in relation to kogui as well.
[6/11/23, 10:26:19 AM] Gary Teh: We need to strategically deploy capital to unlock all the choke points
[6/11/23, 10:27:22 AM] Tess walkowski: My back is against the wall.    Same thing on a personal level.    Slinging cacao.
[6/11/23, 10:27:54 AM] Tess walkowski: I could buy wholesale from dao in 10kilo bulk orders

[6/13/23, 7:48:07 PM] Gary Teh: It’s organic and sustainably grown

And also roasted
[6/13/23, 7:49:07 PM] Gary Teh: Some of them do not qualify as organic under USA law
[6/13/23, 8:05:36 PM] Gary Teh: @13134136108 since we might also be getting supplies from Ecuador we might want to steer the copy away from specifically Bahia Brazil

[6/18/23, 4:53:32 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Going with one because we áre bootstrapping
[6/18/23, 4:53:57 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. What was not set was whether we openly communicate that we are using Amazon to bootstrap as our strategy 🤣
[6/18/23, 4:54:28 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Want me to take that down lol
[6/18/23, 4:54:49 PM] Gary Teh: Nvm. We have a majority 4 out of 7 this poll has past

[6/18/23, 4:55:47 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Anyone can replicate that strategy it's just alot of work and money to do so
[6/18/23, 5:03:03 PM] Gary Teh: That is true 

A lot of these stuff we are setting up is just a lot of brute force

The level of brute force required to set this infrastructure up is basically our defensive moat  🤣

[6/19/23, 9:21:30 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : The infrastructure is alot.
[6/19/23, 9:23:19 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Bootstrapping is different from what would do if we had more rescource.    We have an advantage that more people work for the dao.
[6/19/23, 9:24:59 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I joined the dao with a problem statement: how can i Buy half of My Friends criolla harvest?
[6/19/23, 9:26:20 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I consider dao collaborators, not competition.
[6/19/23, 9:28:19 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I didnt solve my initial problem.   Personally also bootstrapping..... With less rescource.... And i chose a risker market, and risker pricing.

——
Got too distracted today by a whole bunch of random stuff that is not on this project’s critical path.

My energy for the day is all used up. 

Will take a break for the rest of the day to recuperate. 

My personal energy level has been at 20% ever since suffering from the two car crashes and nearly dying in the most recent one in 2021. Crossing 40 years of age also doesn’t help. 

That is my main concern for personally being dragged into too many different directions 🙂🙏

Will check in again tomorrow
[6/20/23, 11:50:47 AM] Gary Teh: Fatima always reminds me the need to behave like a 41 year old man with despite still feeling young at heart so that I don’t wear myself too thin

I think it is great advice

[6/20/23, 3:18:05 PM] Gary Teh: We already have our DAO. That is TrueSight DAO. If we succeed, our DAO has a revenue stream created
[6/20/23, 3:18:24 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : fund sorry
[6/20/23, 3:19:29 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : worst case we fail, reinvent and try again.    Bottstrapping via amazon removes some risk.  I looked at Ebay yesterday.
[6/20/23, 3:19:40 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I learn in the process too.
[6/20/23, 3:21:03 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Personally I sunk $500 into cacao, and hours of work into this within the group.    I have my cacao, and feel like I will sell it, sold two kilos so far.

[6/20/23, 3:21:26 PM] Gary Teh: Are you back in USA? How are you selling it?
[6/20/23, 3:22:24 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I would be open to discussing other options, that fee is high and amazon is a challenge, but if they are holding our cacao it provides a solution until we can fund a warehouse
[6/20/23, 3:22:40 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Preselling via a PDF
[6/20/23, 3:22:55 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I am in a hotel in santa marta living off takeaway
[6/20/23, 3:23:03 PM] Gary Teh: What is PDF?
[6/20/23, 3:23:48 PM] Gary Teh: Same problem that @31641075825 been complaining about in the Hotel industry we have in the online retail industry
[6/20/23, 3:24:06 PM] Gary Teh: At some point we need to get our own warehouse and setup our own fulfilment facilities
[6/20/23, 3:24:09 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : and small sellers paying paypal

Gas fees for transactions are actually charges that was why I was asking @31641075825 about which chain the governance token for the other project he was talking about will be on. 

If a chain provider can convince a project to go on to their chain they technically become the toll gate
[6/20/23, 4:12:31 PM] Suheil - Europe: Ahhh I understand where is my story telling gap

[6/20/23, 4:13:58 PM] Suheil - Europe: We will need to build it up on DAO'a private chain ...actually semi off on chain mix.

What i meant by that 

The registered association legally speaking will have it'd own private tokenized environment using the decentralized
[6/20/23, 4:14:23 PM] Suheil - Europe: So its like if I tell you how the dictator of China did but without being bad people just utilizing the tech for ngo in-house purposes

[6/20/23, 4:15:24 PM] Gary Teh: That is why I kept poking the coops to check if they will be willing to host miners on the facilities to run “our” chain aka TrueChain
[6/20/23, 4:15:23 PM] Suheil - Europe: We don't need miners
[6/20/23, 4:16:11 PM] Suheil - Europe: Today they are many new layers that provide that solution without relying on decentralized chains high fees
[6/20/23, 4:16:24 PM] Suheil - Europe: Correct me if I'm wrong
[6/20/23, 4:16:41 PM] Suheil - Europe: But anyways I don't know the deep tech solution of how I just know that it exists out there lol

[6/20/23, 4:18:51 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[6/20/23, 4:23:23 PM] Gary Teh: And this statement you made is correct

I know the technology full stack from end to end as well as how each layer makes money that is why I am so anal who owns which layer of the stack

If done wrongly it’s like the bunch of us spent all out money to go around the world to build a successful business and once the business is built we hand off the passive income to 1Inch network on a silver platter while we own nothing of it

That to me is just stupid

I might as well go sit by the beach, drink my margarita and do nothing. Save myself all the hassle and my cash too 🤣
[6/20/23, 4:24:36 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Do we really want to move forward or wait to solve this
[6/20/23, 4:26:51 PM] Gary Teh: This is not a blocker for our project’s critical path 

Just treat this as a distraction
[6/20/23, 4:27:15 PM] Gary Teh: We don’t need blockchain at this early stage for this project
[6/20/23, 4:27:29 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Just a dream to solve later.

[6/20/23, 4:28:12 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Will still write keto copy
[6/20/23, 4:28:17 PM] Suheil - Europe: Give the bread to its baker ;)
[6/20/23, 4:28:33 PM] Suheil - Europe: We align on same values
[6/20/23, 4:28:35 PM] Suheil - Europe: And attack
[6/20/23, 4:28:48 PM] Suheil - Europe: And handing over the project is base value that we all agree on
[6/20/23, 4:46:01 PM] Gary Teh: True. Handing over the project To the community. Not handing over to another company
[6/20/23, 6:17:51 PM] Anupa/diya: Self care is very important in the long journey !!
[6/20/23, 6:48:45 PM] Gary Teh: Very true. That is why it is always important to take it easy. 🧘🏻‍♂️
[6/20/23, 7:04:02 PM] Gary Teh: Realized projections are still pre-mature. Need to account for the following cost as well

    - package printing cost per unit
    - packing cost per unit

    - sample lab test cost (one off)

[6/21/23, 7:37:59 AM] Suheil - Europe: Branding doesn't get built overnight you start from scratch with a version then grow it all along the way when the story starts get difused.

It will never be economically viable if when each start up will pay different agencies or designers to just make designs and then choose whichever .... this sounds more like mentality of royal families how they waste their money on projects 🤣🤣🤣
[6/21/23, 7:40:13 AM] Suheil - Europe: Let's start business first and make revenue then we grow in parallel with all aspects
[6/21/23, 7:40:39 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : We arent paying people are we lol ?
[6/21/23, 7:41:04 AM] Suheil - Europe: What you think tokens are there for ?
[6/21/23, 7:41:24 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : We are working for coins on something we believe in 😍
[6/21/23, 7:41:54 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : I mean, yes, but the token have value based on out later succeed
[6/21/23, 7:42:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: Tokens or currency doesn't matter still counts as too many exoenses
[6/21/23, 7:42:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: Which is one of most important factors that kill business in general
[6/21/23, 7:43:04 AM] Suheil - Europe: You can't spend right and left and expect to make success on any business
[6/21/23, 7:44:23 AM] Gary Teh: ‎POLL:
Go ahead and have a second set of logo, package and website created?
‎OPTION: Yes! Let’s do it (3 votes)
‎OPTION: No! Let’s hold off (0 votes)
[6/21/23, 7:44:41 AM] Gary Teh: Bump
[6/21/23, 7:47:25 AM] Suheil - Europe: The question  should be rephrase under budget control 

Should we release more budget for 2nd set of logo yes or no
[6/21/23, 7:47:54 AM] Suheil - Europe: And I think this question should involve governors or financial guild ?
[6/21/23, 7:48:55 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : We could have a second set but do it with the group we have
[6/21/23, 7:49:09 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, best foot forward is good

After all we did have a discussion before about Annia creating a second set of packaging design so that we could choose and vote on it.

The only difference is now, it’s another member creating the second set
[6/21/23, 7:49:37 AM] Suheil - Europe: And u remember what was my answer back then ?
[6/21/23, 7:49:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: Doesn't differ
[6/21/23, 7:49:44 AM] Suheil - Europe: ;)
[6/21/23, 7:49:57 AM] Suheil - Europe: Doesn't matter who is X its not about the X doing what
[6/21/23, 7:50:06 AM] Suheil - Europe: It's about a project business that need to be sustainable at the end
[6/21/23, 7:50:07 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just everybody vote and then we go ahead based on majority outcome
[6/21/23, 7:50:17 AM] Suheil - Europe: And cost control is one of most important success indicators
[6/21/23, 7:51:26 AM] Gary Teh: Actually having two sets would be good as well. As DAO members in the townhall can vote on the set they want to go ahead with
[6/21/23, 7:52:22 AM] Suheil - Europe: Then it should've arranged as a bounty from the beginning where anyone can participate into submitting and whoever get chosen get rewarded the bounty
[6/21/23, 7:52:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: That's how we build based on economy of scale that keeps the eco system sustainable
[6/21/23, 7:52:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: I think that is a great lesson for next time
[6/21/23, 7:53:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: As for now we say we don't cry in milk that got spilled 🤣🤣🤣😅😅😂
[6/21/23, 7:53:19 AM] Gary Teh: I get your point of view. 

Let’s just vote on this 🙂👍
[6/21/23, 7:54:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: For this specifically related topic doesn't matter at all as yes I agree as dao we should propose to all members voting mechanism ..... we will do it more efficient for the future
[6/21/23, 7:55:03 AM] Suheil - Europe: So yes get other set and get members to vote

[6/21/23, 8:31:41 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Product design: make 20 products. One wins.
[6/21/23, 8:31:51 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Agile is trashing your work.
[6/21/23, 8:32:00 AM] Gary Teh: Not true

Each coin is worth USD0.004 each now
[6/21/23, 8:32:52 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Our coins are worth a marginal amount
[6/21/23, 8:33:08 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : We working for love not money
[6/21/23, 8:34:05 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. We are doing divine work for love of truth and Justice
[6/21/23, 8:34:06 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : The model is great.   We are working in hope of success of the whole.
[6/21/23, 8:34:40 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : What if we Made a ux/packaging guild?
[6/21/23, 8:35:53 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : There áre mood boards from anya copy from me and we have the beer hall for ux research base
[6/21/23, 8:37:24 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : All the info being in one spot would be great
[6/21/23, 8:38:00 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Going pro on Figma ir canva is also maybe a good investment
[6/21/23, 8:44:40 AM] Gary Teh: Please surface that in the beer hall?

Let’s keep discussion in this room on track for purpose of discussing Agroverse operational matters 🙂👍

‎[6/21/23, 9:02:56 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[6/21/23, 9:16:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: Lol I didn't understand this cost no I change my opinion as an experienced business entrepreneur with many proven track records this cost is not justifiable at this level at all!
[6/21/23, 9:16:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: Which starting level business or project makes it viable to spend 7-10k on only design !
[6/21/23, 9:17:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: U need licensing u need to start selling u need to pilot
[6/21/23, 9:17:05 AM] Suheil - Europe: Then u can spend as a corporate lol
[6/21/23, 9:18:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: @14153000019 you are 100000x smarter than me in math how u think is that viable by numbers ?
[6/21/23, 9:41:09 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Agree here.   It's not time to do this.
[6/21/23, 9:42:20 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Thats value equal to what we spend on out product.
[6/21/23, 9:44:10 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : We have a single goal. Sell nibs on Amazon. Make profit.   Move forward slow and steady.
[6/21/23, 9:45:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: Agree
[6/21/23, 9:45:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: We are bootstrapping its about advancing not spending :)
[6/21/23, 9:46:01 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Still stand My vote of more packaging design.
[6/21/23, 9:47:55 AM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : But bootstrapped
[6/21/23, 10:16:23 AM] Anupa/diya: The fact that work has been already done has to be taken  into account . What we can do is the work done till now gets tokenized. 

We can look into the second option and see which one is opted by the DAO  

However going forward. We should have a bid for any  given work and the dao should choose.
[6/21/23, 10:16:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Mid way selections are counter productive
[6/21/23, 10:18:13 AM] Suheil - Europe: Rephrase the voting and let's vote :)

The voting should say:
Should we spend 7k to re do another set

Such make huge difference.... according to my personal opinion :)
[6/21/23, 10:19:58 AM] Anupa/diya: We can see which direction with both the options but let this just be for now.
[6/21/23, 10:28:30 AM] Gary Teh: Please update your vote
[6/21/23, 10:40:22 AM] Gary Teh: The universe will course correct itself. Meanwhile please cast your vote. 🙂👍🏻
[6/21/23, 10:41:55 AM] Suheil - Europe: Ur question is wrong nothing to votre
[6/21/23, 10:41:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: Vote
[6/21/23, 10:42:11 AM] Gary Teh: You can choose to abstain as well.
[6/21/23, 10:42:32 AM] Suheil - Europe: The question is wrongly formulate
‎[6/21/23, 10:43:23 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[6/21/23, 10:44:45 AM] Gary Teh: Please note that members can also choose to create a new poll and then vote on that. I don't have dictatorship rights to that. 🙂
[6/21/23, 10:45:03 AM] Gary Teh: What I am here to do is just facilitate the process.
[6/21/23, 10:45:31 AM] Suheil - Europe: On your current question I vote yes
[6/21/23, 10:45:45 AM] Suheil - Europe: Simply doesn't represent the reality 🤷‍♂️
[6/21/23, 10:47:10 AM] Anupa/diya: We have to see which part of the process we can do this kind of intervention.

We can somewhat still do it but from the way forward We have to project management better 

If we have multiple people wanting to do the same thing.. which is fine.  We need to have the selection process before the work starts 

On the website .. we should add potential roles for execution . Please can submit their proposals and the DAO works
[6/21/23, 10:47:12 AM] Gary Teh: If Alessandro and his wife wants to spend GBP 7K of their own free will to advance the DAO, then it is their choice to do so.

What is within our scope is to clearly identify what they are trying to contribute and then determine if it will be of use to us.
[6/21/23, 10:48:18 AM] Anupa/diya: The Finance is one thing but it's also acknowledging the time and effort that is put in.
[6/21/23, 10:51:25 AM] Gary Teh: The reality that second set of designs are still up in the air. Who knows they might just change their mind after my email response to them. 

The universe will take care of itself. I spend my time on items on the critical path.
[6/21/23, 11:04:44 AM] Gary Teh: Please just submit your vote and let's move it. I will base my follow up actions with Alessandro and Maria according to the outcome of the vote.

Also once they provide the itemized breakdown of the items they would like to contribute, we can discuss here and then pick and choose what we need regarding items from the list.

I would be curious about how the logo and packaging rendition would look like based on their interpretation of the brand positioning and mood board that Fatima crafted. 

The recent portfolio they submitted as reference seems really well done

https://www.goldenleafoflondon.org/

Also if what they say is true, they will be putting a full time employee on the tasks. So timeline wise, it is likely execution speed via that route might end faster than @972543523823 who only has weekends to work on this. So very likely both set of designs will become available at around the same time. So timeline wise, we should not be expecting much additional delay in the execution of our critical path.

The fact they will be able to throw in a website is a huge bonus. This is taking into account, other than Shadi who has been brought in to work on the website, no one else in the DAO has bandwidth for that. And Shadi is not able to execute at the pace expected had I the bandwidth to do the execution myself. 

My sense given his kind of pace, we will only expect a main website up by end of this year (if it happens) the earliest we will be expecting a dedicated site up for Agroverse via Shadi's route will be end of next year. 

So in conclusion, when I surface propose, I always have timelines and deadlines accounted for in the back of my mind.
[6/21/23, 11:54:47 AM] Gary Teh: Taking a break now. 

Items 1,24 are completed. Will work on item 3 once I get back

    - follow up with Tres on Trade Marks and Bar code
    - follow up with @17782305576 on lab testing cost and process
    - figure out the Amazon seller's account for creating listing and the warehousing destination they will direct us to

[6/22/23, 3:05:09 PM] Gary Teh: Two of three items are completed 

Just the Amazon account 

Seems it’s going to take a while

[6/22/23, 5:13:37 PM] Gary Teh: @17782305576 is right now getting the quotation for lab testing from the various labs 

Would be great to get the quotation from your friend too
[6/22/23, 7:57:13 PM] Gary Teh: Primarily the strategy around our initial distribution channel is keyword based growth hacking. There are keywords when used in the amazon listings will boost visibility and drive sales. So long as we know there is demand then its primarily about optimizing the use of these keywords when generating the product listings
[6/26/23, 6:47:51 AM] Gary Teh: Personal Focus for the day

[6/29/23, 5:47:25 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : The organic tobacco from argentina is fire
[6/29/23, 5:47:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Not for sale usa.... The loose tobacco
[6/29/23, 5:47:58 PM] Gary Teh: I noticed they also produce rapeh in Brazil as well. 

It is almost starting to feel like there might be a ceremonial organic produce segment to be served somewhere in the USA

Right now the distribution channel is unclear. And no, one and one direct sale is not a scalable go to market strategy.
[6/29/23, 5:48:38 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Rapeh is Brazil.   It's the tribes. Have Many connects when we go.
[6/29/23, 5:49:43 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : This point.... We are boot strapping ok....but they demand alot and eat our profit and change for warehousing....
[6/29/23, 5:51:34 PM] Gary Teh: Means to an ends. Unless we can convince a whole bunch of commercial folks to offer up their spare warehousing capacity to store our stuff for tokens

But then again they might just end up asking for fiat

Once this reaches scale, almost make sense to just buy/rent our own warehouse in USA
[6/29/23, 5:52:04 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : Can't wait!
[6/29/23, 5:53:44 PM] Tess Walkowski - Colombia : All is ceremony.   All is inherant Divine. After enlightenrment chop wood carry water

[7/2/23, 5:47:14 AM] Gary Teh: Updated Agroverse's milestone 1 critical path diagram to highlight in red what needs immediate attention. 

For a more detailed view of the diagram, please reference here
https://truesight.me/dao/agroverse/progress

Items on the hot seat:
----
    - DApp to allow DAO members to vote on rake rate (Myself and @31641075825 )
    - Legal document to make corresponding NFT issue binding (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Legal document to enforce proper use of funds gathered from NFT issue (@31641075825  only if you can find lawyers)
    - Exclusive distribution rights agreement signed with Bahia Brazil (myself)
    - Content for product listing page (@918017107841 let us know if you are already done and @972543523823 can take over)
    - Create GS1 barcode number (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)
    - Figure out the exact warehousing location to ship our goods to in USA (Me)
    - Follow up to ensure DUNS number is finally issued (Me)
    - Define go to market strategy (I am aware that @31641075825 promised to do it. Ay this point, I doubt he has the bandwidth to undertake this. I am inclined to relief him of this)
    - Content for Amazon seller profile page (@918017107841  please let us know when the first draft will be available)
    - Get TradeMark registered (Still awaiting release of funds from DAO vault. The task is on me)

All the other tasks that are marked in white are basically blocked by these tasks in red

        - this will also help determine the mark up rate for the cacao raw materials that @573136732781 is trying to buy from the DAO that we right now have in stock
[7/6/23, 11:00:20 AM] Gary Teh: - this will also inform the pricing markup which we will be presenting to the Brazilian buyer on the healthcare products  sourced from USA

[7/13/23, 8:22:43 AM] Gary Teh: I will also be sourcing for a certified kitchen facility in Silicon Valley which I could utilize by the hour to pack the cacao nibs into. 

That way, the 22 bags of cacao nibs created from the 5KG of supply can be sold in the USA without too much concerns since the manufacturing facility used in the USA is already on the FDA registry

[7/13/23, 9:31:31 AM] Gary Teh: I see it more as a network of polyamorous commercial relationships

Mono (single) and gamy (exclusive) are not what I have in mind.
Rather Poly (many) and amorous (non-exclusive) feels more appropriate.
[7/13/23, 9:32:20 AM] Gary Teh: Just like the internet, every single server is essentially replaceable.

[7/24/23, 10:48:43 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has compiled a list of SF keto groups on Facebook which we could target to find participants for our upcoming focus group 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x5R_Vat0_RGIk8TWUAm4GVbl7jk4CEpKkV2-4hubb5M/edit

We could further expand on this list to include keto groups that are not based in San Francisco for our online focus group studies 

Let’s try to fill it up.
[7/24/23, 10:59:08 AM] Gary Teh: Shall we brain storm on a bunch of Call to actions we can use to recruit participants?

Please let me know your thoughts

[7/24/23, 11:46:05 PM] Gary Teh: Folks, I have spoken with @5511982667030 @918017107841 and @41796560010 

Run the focus groups separately, but just ensure we sync up on the insights

@918017107841 design your own online version 

@41796560010 design and run your own online version 

@5511982667030 update the questions which we will be using for the offline version in San Francisco

[7/26/23, 8:46:27 AM] Gary Teh: If no more feedback, I will start using the script to recruit for focus group participants in our offline session on the 20th of august
[7/26/23, 8:53:53 AM] Anupa/diya: Iwona  and I have figured out an online collab . I think we can share something by next weekend

[7/26/23, 9:00:27 AM] Gary Teh: We will execute on this once we get the quotations from our supplier for the preparation and shipping of the 100kg cacao nibs
[7/26/23, 9:02:59 AM] Gary Teh: The USD3000 will only allow us to work with a single supplier

So from my perspective, once we get the quotations in from both Brazil and Ecuador we will know which supplier we will have Ken work with for his engagement

[7/26/23, 11:59:55 AM] Val Lapidus: Are we going to mark on each bag which country the nibs came from?

[7/26/23, 12:01:50 PM] Gary Teh: See lower right hand corner of the package design

As discussed and agreed upon with Tres, country will have its own GS1 barcode 

That way if one country has issues the rest are not affected
[7/26/23, 12:10:12 PM] Val Lapidus: Does each country have different taste?
[7/26/23, 12:19:14 PM] Gary Teh: Yes. Very different 

You will be very surprised
[7/26/23, 12:19:26 PM] Gary Teh: You will get a sense once we meet
[7/26/23, 12:25:54 PM] Val Lapidus: I think that whatever the profile of the flavor is for each country we should lift that on the bag so that consumers know what they are getting
[7/26/23, 12:27:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, my wife works in impact investing.  Something that they're recently making a change to is instead of having a farmer bee sustainable, they should be a regenerative farmer which means it's better for the environment and for their farmland.  Perhaps we should market ourselves as working with regenerative farmers rather than
[7/26/23, 12:28:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Sustainable farming.
[7/26/23, 12:59:08 PM] Gary Teh: Makes sense. 🙂👍

[7/27/23, 12:24:39 PM] Gary Teh: @41796560010 would it be possible for us to record the upcoming zoom session? 

That way we can go through it again later and start pulling out all the insights into a document 🙂👍
[7/27/23, 12:51:48 PM] Iwona Fluda: The insights will be documented during the session, so no recording needed. Per principle to ensure trust and deep collaboration, I don’t record the session. 
P.S. just realized that I was too optimistic to run it next week, might move the date.

[7/27/23, 11:50:41 PM] Gary Teh: Just a random crazy idea, I wonder if it might actually be cheaper to just simply buy a cheap car and park it by the LAX parking lot for USD155 per month for storage purposes. 🤣
[7/28/23, 12:00:42 AM] Iwona Fluda: If that’s legal OK and the microclimate of the car won’t impact the quality of the product - why not?

[7/28/23, 8:34:57 AM] Tess walkowski: I want to do a white chocolate with raspberry and could use nibs for that but need the cacao butter too and vanilla lol
[7/28/23, 8:35:08 AM] Tess walkowski: Or things for at home keto
[7/28/23, 9:37:19 AM] Gary Teh: something like this might us serve well

Tear out the four backseats and we are done. 

All 90kg can be stored in the space that are freed up. 

We can park it by ocean beach SF. The weather is generally chilly here anyways.

[7/28/23, 10:24:25 AM] Val Lapidus: Sorry Gary, this is a bad idea. It will get broken into and everything inside of it will be stalled
[7/28/23, 10:24:32 AM] Val Lapidus: Stolen
[7/28/23, 10:26:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Or most likely the car itself will get stolen
‎[7/28/23, 11:00:56 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[7/28/23, 11:04:35 AM] Gary Teh: We can keep boxes at your place for fulfillment purposes as and when orders come in from Amazon

The rest of the 18 boxes we can keep them in the storage unit for USD17 a month
[7/28/23, 11:05:18 AM] Val Lapidus: Honestly I'll charge you $15 a month and it doesn't have to be USD. It can be tokens
[7/28/23, 11:05:46 AM] Val Lapidus: Or if you feel like that's too much, you name me a proce
[7/28/23, 11:08:11 AM] Gary Teh: In tokens would be wonderful. Deal!! 🤩
boomz! 👊🏻

Just to clarify is it for storing of the 2 boxes and handling the fulfillment from Amazon as and when they come in?
[7/28/23, 11:08:40 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.

[7/29/23, 3:51:16 PM] Val Lapidus: I have a Prius v which has a little bit of extra carrying capacity. It's deceptively large
[7/29/23, 3:51:24 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. That should work. I don’t think the airport authorities would be very happy for us to go in and out multiple times
[7/29/23, 3:51:38 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! 🤩
[7/29/23, 3:52:37 PM] Val Lapidus: When does it arrive?
[7/29/23, 3:53:33 PM] Val Lapidus: I think I can fit all 20
[7/29/23, 3:56:27 PM] Gary Teh: Still a few more steps before we get there 

   Step 1 - finalize quotation from supplier which includes packaging 

    Step 2 - sign agreement with them to go ahead and assemble the packaging 

   Step 3 - sign agreement with and pay FSVP agent USD3000

    Step 4 - get our FSVP agent to get talk to their QC department to get the paperwork we need from them

    Step 5 - finally ship it over to SFO
[7/29/23, 3:58:27 PM] Gary Teh: Nice! It shouldn’t take up more than 15 cubic foot of space

[7/30/23, 12:42:17 AM] Anupa/diya: Hey I was thinking of doing mine on the 20th August since you had said early August. Should we just do it so close  or spread it out . I can do mine in September sometime
[7/30/23, 12:58:20 AM] Iwona Fluda: We can decide depending on the number of registrations & channels we are promoting this event on. If also on Meetup, yes - it makes sense to have both further apart.
[7/30/23, 12:58:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: As mentioned somewheer above, I might move the event as I was too optimistic to run in just in a week .

[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: It's what we can approach vendors with
[7/30/23, 11:29:02 AM] Gary Teh: A 3-4 page visual summary of us to potential clients
[7/30/23, 12:21:09 PM] Gary Teh: I think it’s also important to figure out how will the partners that you have in mind would benefit from supporting us since they already have their core business and would probably not want to get distract from that.

Once we are done with our focus group, I suggest that we arrange a Zoom session where we meet up to share the insights we have gathered. Thereafter we do a poll to figure out which components in each stage of the AAARR to prioritize since there are literally a whole bunch of options available at each stage.
[7/30/23, 4:00:46 PM] Gary Teh: As @5511982667030 has suggested the other DAO members do not have enough of in-depth context on our project, so prioritization of options voting will be done within this guild

As and when we need help and support we could reach out to the larger DAO via the townhall or the beer hall

That way we could  reduced noise in our collaboration efforts, be more focused in our execution, be more selective in when we tap into the larger DAO thereby also reducing noise levels in the main channels 🙂👍

[7/31/23, 10:12:39 AM] Gary Teh: For the few samples we are going to make either in my car or @16468233438 place

If the agricultural cooperatives we are getting our supplies from ends up failing to help us with the packaging and we have to assemble it ourselves and we figure there is demand for powder form too, we might end up assembling the cacao powder bags in a commercial kitchen here in SF

[7/31/23, 9:35:58 PM] Anupa/diya: Sure! I had a brief glance.. looks good. I think all of us are pretty much aligned with the same approach
[7/31/23, 9:36:38 PM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 @16468233438 if you guys could also photograph.  It's good for documentation
[7/31/23, 9:38:37 PM] Gary Teh: @5511982667030 was suggesting once we are done with these three separate focus groups we regroup to start defining the customer personas in keto cacao nibs market segment
[7/31/23, 10:42:08 PM] Anupa/diya: For sure !
[7/31/23, 10:42:43 PM] Anupa/diya: I was going to suggest the same so the synthesis can feed into the main insights

[8/1/23, 1:16:19 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 should we go ahead and create another meetup for our 20th august offline focus group in San Francisco? 

That way I could direct all the sf folks to that meetup when I go do my stuff in the relevant Facebook groups

[8/2/23, 8:07:02 AM] Gary Teh: Key personal focus for today
——
    - recruit 6 participants for the 20th august offline focus group in San Francisco from the Facebook groups targeted
[8/2/23, 8:14:22 AM] Tess walkowski: Same issues on stickers and labels
[8/2/23, 8:16:54 AM] Iwona Fluda: Does the packaging need to be sustainable?
[8/2/23, 8:18:21 AM] Anupa/diya: You should ask them what is the issue. The only issue I see couldn't be the dpi High print or they needed an open file. I feel you can just go to neighborhood printer
[8/2/23, 8:20:33 AM] Gary Teh: What is the context behind this question?
[8/2/23, 8:22:56 AM] Iwona Fluda: Positioning, etc. I run a social enterprise here in Switzerland, and my aim is to create a 360 degrees social enterprise. That means that all steps on the way need to be social and sustainable. This is also great for positioning, not just because part of my heart beats for it.
[8/2/23, 8:23:56 AM] Iwona Fluda: With the assumption that keto nerds might be also socially and environmentally aware, this could be a great differenciator
[8/2/23, 8:24:23 AM] Gary Teh: We will hopefully gain some insights on this during the focus groups
[8/2/23, 8:24:52 AM] Iwona Fluda: P.S. as a nerd myself, I would go for it :P
[8/2/23, 8:25:05 AM] Tess walkowski: Cacao is a medicine of the heart, so it makes sense, and the tree grows best like the heart wild and free
[8/2/23, 8:25:36 AM] Tess walkowski: I was thinking about cacao ceremonies for nerds as a fellow nerd
[8/2/23, 8:26:17 AM] Iwona Fluda: Im in! Also: just stopped drinking coffee a few weeks ago and move to cacao and matcha.
[8/2/23, 8:27:04 AM] Tess walkowski: Matcha would also be great to source and import and it's a great comparison
[8/2/23, 8:27:21 AM] Tess walkowski: Preparing matcha is a ritual

[8/3/23, 11:22:45 AM] Gary Teh: While we await for participants, I was thinking through the following aspects of the go to market for our keto cacao nibs 

*The channel*
Which social media platforms to utilize Instagram, YouTube, TikTok…

*The method*
Paying for ads or getting influencers to do the promotion  

*The format*
Text, videos or photos as the primary format 

Once we figure out what the Unique value proposition (UVP) is, we will need to package the UVP and deliver it on the right channel, using the right method and the right format 

*paramters*
The parameters to consider are

    - cost: how much does it cost to. More competition more costly. More channels more costly.
 
    - reach: how many people naturally hang out at the channel 

    - uniqueness: how much can our messaging stand out. More competition using the same format less unique
[8/3/23, 11:23:40 AM] Gary Teh: Would be great to get some new ideas on 

    - channel
    - method 
    - format

Once we figure out one that works, I propose we should just double down on it till we hit channel saturation

[8/3/23, 5:07:15 PM] Gary Teh: This is for 100kg shipment size

Prize increases to USD20,000 when if shipment size increases to 1,000KG
[8/3/23, 6:02:56 PM] Gary Teh: I believe the package size needs to be just right that the entire package runs out after 30 days of consumption 

That way, customers will be compelled to want to buy another package from us to participate in the same game again next month and win. 

Every month is a new round

Honestly I am struggling on my side at the moment trying to recruit focus group participants. 

Somewhat throwing in the towel on my side at this point in that department. If anyone wants to pick up the slack please feel free. 🙏
[8/4/23, 2:31:39 PM] Gary Teh: Just finished reading through this 24 page FSVP regulation document regarding small importers like us

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/.github/blob/main/assets/20220329_anika_the_non_fungible_gauntlet.pdf

These were left by Anika who was active in our DAO last year when she was fanatical about NFTs. She has since became inactive, I believe she lost a whole bunch of life savings from her parents investing them in NFTs.

Nevertheless the education materials she acquired are still useful for the NFT campaign that you are working on

[8/7/23, 10:33:03 PM] Anupa/diya: Well in that case your user base will want to look inti at the value of the token rather than the product itself. Our target group will be very different and we wil need a very robust plan for token circulation and also marketing.
[8/7/23, 10:33:27 PM] Anupa/diya: We could definitely look at time stamping
[8/7/23, 10:33:51 PM] Anupa/diya: How many packages can be made
[8/7/23, 10:34:12 PM] Gary Teh: first shipment 500 packages of 8 ounce
[8/7/23, 10:34:28 PM] Gary Teh: what was your original thought?
[8/7/23, 10:38:32 PM] Anupa/diya: I was thinking that if we sell this batch through Amazon and other methods we can start the initial run for product circulation and awareness building. We are not selling it as trade and utility tool. The dynamics of that is very different.
[8/7/23, 10:40:32 PM] Anupa/diya: We should look at time stamping where we have the packet on the blockavhain for Traceability and transperancy. I think that's more valuable at this point
[8/7/23, 10:42:01 PM] Anupa/diya: We can do a nft pilot project. After a few sales. There are so many scams no one wants to invest without some proof
[8/7/23, 10:43:31 PM] Anupa/diya: If we are adding the products on the shelves I think that's great visibility
[8/7/23, 10:44:40 PM] Anupa/diya: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsbtc.com/nft/blue-chip-nft-101-down-down-to-goblintown-an-unlikely-success-story/amp/

[8/8/23, 11:12:23 PM] Anupa/diya: Time stamping can also include the shipping

[8/10/23, 10:46:06 AM] Gary Teh: If we plan to utilize FoodLens for traceability, FoodLens will charge us 3% of our retail price to generate QR codes linking back to their site which showcases the entire supply chain 

Makes sense to incorporate this if traceability so important that it drives consumer purchasing behavior 

If not, I am not sure why we are introducing this cost component that will eat into our profit margins
[8/10/23, 10:46:37 AM] Gary Teh: Could you further expand on this
[8/10/23, 10:50:47 AM] Gary Teh: *Key personal focus for today*

    - assemble actual package based on Brazil cooperative dimension

    - chat with @16468233438 about how to approach Dean on burning man 

    - figure out if we will use Shopify or a simple Wordpress shopping cart website for Agroverse consumer facing website 

    - reach out to one more financing professional (within John Tan’s network) to get a second opinion on the financing structure for the incoming shipments

[8/10/23, 10:59:19 AM] Anupa/diya: During one of the initial conversations, when we said we would have the option of buying via the website. We said we would initially direct the consumers to Amazon and not go through the logistics
[8/10/23, 11:00:53 AM] Anupa/diya: Should we put it on hold then
[8/10/23, 11:00:58 AM] Gary Teh: Amazon charged USD4 for the logistics 

Essentially that would kill off our profit margins
[8/10/23, 11:01:23 AM] Anupa/diya: Can we manage self shipment
[8/10/23, 11:01:47 AM] Gary Teh: If you are already in the middle of it, complete what you have done and present it to our guild 

We can then file it away on our ledger and revisit it once we are ready

[8/10/23, 11:03:19 AM] Anupa/diya: Even If we do it. It will be take us a while to release it. We need to build the community atleast for the next 6 months. If we do the nft project with right scope it should take us a few months
[8/10/23, 11:03:44 AM] Gary Teh: Diana is a fund manager in the ESG space and Web3 space
[8/10/23, 11:04:21 AM] Gary Teh: Makes sense to continue executing it then if the lag time is so long
[8/10/23, 11:04:59 AM] Anupa/diya: Just adding it on opensea won't be advisable
[8/10/23, 11:14:06 AM] Iwona Fluda: We can help here with the NFTs - launching a new platform soon and happy to have you as early adopters 🌟
[8/10/23, 11:14:45 AM] Iwona Fluda: Totally agreed, did some extra deep analysis of different platforms and this one is a no go.
[8/10/23, 11:19:21 AM] Anupa/diya: It will still be Early. I think the new platform releases soon right ?
[8/10/23, 11:19:38 AM] Gary Teh: Ok. I trust both of you can oversee this aspects of Agroverse. I am hands off on this 🙂🙏

Logistics and go to market is a hand full right now
[8/10/23, 11:21:44 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya there are better ones but this is the most popular . However I feel we need to focus on teh strategy first and more so building the cacao nibs community
[8/10/23, 11:21:53 AM] Anupa/diya: Are we using social media marketing M
[8/10/23, 11:24:27 AM] Iwona Fluda: Yes, but we will be definitely for more than a longer while on the market. 😂

He mentions it would be hard if we don’t know what is the actual material the printer will be printing on 

Would there be a way to ask Orlantildes to get a sample material from the printer and have it shipped over?

[8/11/23, 12:35:55 PM] Annia 7ob: Okay, what are time limits?

[8/11/23, 12:45:55 PM] Val Lapidus: @5511982667030 if we wanted 50 kilos right now, not packaged.  How much would it cost and how long till it gets here?
[8/11/23, 12:59:56 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 What is the purpose and context for this request?

There is alot already going on on Orlantildes Bahia, Brazil side. Fatima has spoken with me to propose we have a clear strategy regarding how we interface with Brazil otherwise it will appear very haphazard from their perspective and it will not reflect well on us.
[8/11/23, 1:00:51 PM] Val Lapidus: I was thinking about burning Man and trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile to give an extra amount of supply to our contact there. If they agree
[8/11/23, 1:01:39 PM] Val Lapidus: I feel that burning man has a large population of people who are specifically going to be consumers of this type of product and it might be worthwhile to give out more samples to them

[8/11/23, 1:24:08 PM] Gary Teh: After reading this yesterday and then rediving into FDA regulations on the food supply verification program for small entities (TrueTech Inc is one)

https://www.fda.gov/media/110327/download

I believe we (TrueTech Inc) will need to maintain our own set of records of our auditing of our foreign suppliers 

If it is indeed true, then there might in fact be a use case for utilizing blockchain establish our track records of auditing our foreign suppliers to meet the FSVP program

    - @918017107841 who had been lobbying for the use of blockchain in our traceability might feel excited because we might now have a very valid use case

    - @16468233438 who mentioned he is keen to build out a tech stack specifically geared towards companies might find this uses case  for FSVP compliance record keeping interesting

Alternatively, you can grind them down like a coffee.  However, if you wanted to do your own chocolate processing, you can get a tumbler specifically made for processing cacao beads into raw chocolate
[8/11/23, 2:54:22 PM] Gary Teh: I will just invite him over to your place or both of us head over then we can chat

This is because that will be when we pack the four bags of cacao nibs for burning man which @16203326626 will bring with him
[8/12/23, 7:15:36 PM] Val Lapidus: Gary, how about 8:00 a.m. Pacific tomorrow or after 6:00 p.m. Tomorrow
[8/12/23, 7:16:16 PM] Gary Teh: I can do 8am tomorrow morning
[8/12/23, 7:17:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Also Gary with regards to a potential supplier of Peruvian nibs.  Would it be cost effective for us to do that?  Isn't the point that we are buying directly from the producer Farmer in Brazil or wherever and that is why we are getting a reduction in cost. Wouldn't the Peruvian supplier that has the product already in the US in his price include the cost of getting the product here. So what would be the point of buying from them unless we are handling the export? What are we adding to this? That makes it worthwhile?

[8/12/23, 7:24:26 PM] Gary Teh: You are correct 

It totally negates the story we are telling if we got the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

My original random stupid idea was that if people in the keto community doesn’t really care where the supplies come from then why not just get the supplies from the Peruvian distributor 

But a lot more facts has surfaced since that random stupid idea and now to make it obvious that was a random stupid idea.

It is like us buying some stuff from Walmart and then trying to sell you the stuff for a margin when you could just walk down the street yourself and then buy it yourself or just buy online. Totally zero value adding

Then I will proceed with @5511982667030 based on what you and me have ascertained 

Then me and @5511982667030 will package the request as per her suggestion to Orlantildes 

And then the final supply chain will be locked down as such
[8/21/23, 7:54:07 PM] Gary Teh: One other pre-requisite other than commercial kitchen rental is the purchase of package printing equipment
[8/21/23, 7:54:24 PM] Gary Teh: I have updated our agenda for tomorrow’s meeting

You can leave that scope out from your efforts for now

That way we avoid fumbling over each other as we update the Agroverse.shop website
[8/21/23, 10:57:08 PM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 @16468233438 Please have a look I have updated the homepage with the structure we were discussing. Please edit text as per requirement. Gary - the page isnt published .. Just saved.

Me and @16468233438 have concluded our meeting. 

*The resolution*
    - source for commercial kitchen here in the Bay area to package our initial 100KG of cacao nibs
    - source for vendor to print stickers which we will use to stick on the 500 kraft pouches we will buy on Amazon

*Updated agenda when myself and @5511982667030 convenes*
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will package our cacao nibs using kraft pouch
    - To figure out how to convey to Orlantildes that we will handle the packaging for the initial 100KG
    - to determine which of the following we will convey to Orlantildes post 100KG pilot test:
        - Option 1) we will not be packaging our cacao nibs in Bahia ever again
        - Option 2) we will consider packaging in Bahia after the initial pilot test if a kraft pouch supplier that is economic can be sourced
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes to drop all current arrangements we have already in place with Mailan and Package printing company
    - to figure out how to convey to Orlantildes we will pass him a sample of the taste profile we are going for based on the outcome of our focus group. He will need to source for USDA NOP organic certified cacao nibs and ensure they match the taste profile we indicated
[8/22/23, 6:49:04 PM] Val Lapidus: Speaking to my friend about our project.  Within our copy for the website we should have a comparison of how much a farmer usually makes when they sell cacao nibs to a distributor versus what a farmer will make when they sell to us.
‎[8/22/23, 6:50:18 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[8/22/23, 6:50:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, we should approach the company imperfect foods
[8/22/23, 6:51:39 PM] Val Lapidus: We should also donate a portion of our proceeds to carbon offsets
[8/22/23, 6:51:58 PM] Val Lapidus: Imperfect foods might be a good source of distribution for us
‎[8/22/23, 6:53:23 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[8/22/23, 7:19:18 PM] Gary Teh: Since the farmers plant trees

Why not directly issue carbon credits when every cacao tree sapling that gets planted??
[8/22/23, 8:27:47 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 please invite my friend Liz, she is the one that had those ideas above and should get credit for them.  Also she said she would like to help with the project
‎[8/22/23, 8:28:55 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎Contact card omitted
[8/22/23, 8:33:43 PM] Gary Teh: I am adding Liz to our beer hall for now 

Once we have a clear idea of the role she can play we can invite her into the guild

At which point, we will remove one member from the guild 🙂🙏

[8/23/23, 8:36:38 AM] Val Lapidus: Conversely, chocolate needs to be totally protected against frost, heat, damage and loss of flavours. Chocolate bars are usually wrapped with a layer of aluminium foil or coated paper to preserve flavour, and covered by a sturdier outer layer typically made from cardboard or paper.

[8/23/23, 8:47:26 AM] Val Lapidus: we have two great vendors for packaging, one at 1.95 per bag, which is a kraft compostable laminate (this was the type of bag that was most popular in our focus group, it evoked a sense of health),  and one which is 1.35/unit the material being multilayer aluminum foil (we have not tested this within the market)
[8/23/23, 8:48:06 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 and @16468233438 can we push back our 9am meeting for another 30minutes?

I need to head to the post office first to check out the dimension of the envelopes 

Created a stamps.com account yesterday that will give us cheaper shipping price but they need to know envelope dimensions before shipping labels could be printing
[8/23/23, 8:48:24 AM] Val Lapidus: yes, but i have a hard stop at 10a.m.

[8/24/23, 9:12:18 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 pertaining the fundraising idea you have.

Would you be open to creating a deck? 

*purpose of the deck*
    - use it for fundraising 
    - use part of it as sales deck which we will need when reaching out to larger distributors
[8/24/23, 9:13:13 AM] Gary Teh: Had a chat with Victor last night. Understood that for initial pilot test with Whole Foods, they would want to have 500units ready for sale as testing
[8/24/23, 9:13:55 AM] Anupa/diya: Yes totally .
[8/24/23, 9:14:35 AM] Anupa/diya: We need a pair of eyes for the finance and tech
[8/24/23, 9:15:33 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 what goes into a pilot test with Whole Foods?  is there like a sampling station where they put someone out to have people try it, or is it just put on the shelf, and blamo, what's the per unit price that wholefoods pays us for the 500 units, or is it consignment based?
[8/24/23, 9:15:49 AM] Anupa/diya: I have looked a few ongoing grants which will be good to apply.
[8/24/23, 9:16:22 AM] Anupa/diya: Good point. Will agroverse become a listed vendor ?
[8/24/23, 9:21:52 AM] Gary Teh: Danielle Sunberg (business side) and her husband (finance side) would be good candidates for eyes

[8/24/23, 9:22:51 AM] Val Lapidus: do we have control of how samples are given?  like could we insist that it be sliced banana dunked in nibs?
‎[8/24/23, 9:23:02 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/24/23, 9:54:45 AM] Gary Teh: Someone in our DAO will be volunteering to hand out the samples if and when that happens. 🤣
[8/24/23, 10:19:47 AM] Gary Teh: @381642051030 regarding the go to market strategy document you will be crafting which we will walk through on 2nd of September could we have the following sections included

- Roles: their required weekly task described at a high level
    - Props: items we will need to have ready for these people to perform their roles
    - Schedule: exact step by step as to what task to perform for each role

That way, we have a good overview of what the level of undertaking is when we go about doing the execution. With that we will be able to:

    - adjust task load on each role
    - provide members with visibility we reach out to them for help

[8/25/23, 3:31:53 PM] Val Lapidus: For our pie chart, the numbers are as follows:
Farmer: 24%
Transportation: 25%
Packaging: 18%
DAO portion: 33%
[8/25/23, 3:35:39 PM] Val Lapidus: For others in the market the numbers are as follows: (according to World Economic Forum)
Retailer: 44%
Packaging: 32%
Transportation: 14%
Farmer: 6%

[8/26/23, 11:14:06 PM] Gary Teh: I have posed a request to @5511982667030 that for the upcoming meeting on Monday to inform Orlantildes of the following activities we are conducting on our end

*Items I am preparing*
- the list of critical points in the supply chain on Brazilian side identified during my previous visit 

- a preliminary list of hazards identified along each critical point of the cacao nibs preparation process based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested preventive controls based on FDA FSVP regulations 

- a list of suggested verifications measures to ensure integrity of preventive controls 

*What we need from him*
- a copy of the certificate of compliance that Coopercabruca has from the Brazilian government to allow for exports of cacao nibs overseas 

- preventive controls that Coopercabruca has in place to ensure they continue being in compliance with Brazilian government regulations to be eligible for exports of cacao nibs 

*expected outcomes of this exercise*

- combined and properly curated list of hazards identified to comply with existing Brazilian government regulations before exports are allowed and FDA FSVP compliance requirements 

- list of preventive measures that Coopercabruca has in place to prevent identified hazards 

- agreed upon verifications steps that Coopercabruca will undertake to ensure continued compliance so as to prevent identified potential hazards from occurring 

 *final outputs from this process* 

- a written assurance letter addressed to our company by the person in charge of quality control in Coopercabruca that agreed upon preventive controls are in place to prevent the list of potential hazards we have identified during this exercise 

- a mutually agreed upon recurring procedure we both agree to follow to verify that preventive controls are being diligently followed by Coopercabruca during the preparation and export of the cacao nibs

[8/26/23, 11:54:11 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 since you and me will be repackaging the cacao nibs in the kitchen facility we are renting, I will be drafting a set of the following documents 

*documents*
- hazard analysis
- preventive controls
- verification steps 

*outcome*
- When using the kitchen we will need to adhere to the preventative controls  that are documented 
- this is to cover our asses legally even though we are qualified for very small business exemptions 

*later on after successful mvp*
- get certified as a Preventive control qualified individual (15 hour structured curriculum) so that when our US based food facility gets audited by the FDA we got our asses covered because we have the necessary certification to claim preventive control qualified individual status 

- register the food facility we are planning to use on an ongoing basis

*regarding shared kitchen arrangement*

- The operator of the shared kitchen does not need to register the food facility with the FDA since that operator does not directly handle the food 

But post the MVP we will need to register whatever food facility we plan to use on an ongoing basis with the FDA and be compliant 

Check out this document if you are keen

[8/28/23, 8:52:12 AM] Val Lapidus: I don't remember any one in the focus group wanting the nibs to be smaller???  where did that feedback come from?
[8/28/23, 8:54:57 AM] Anupa/diya: I was creating the pie @16468233438 . Where would we add the budget for operations, tech, legal, customer support, marketing  and others. Would that be under the DAO
[8/28/23, 9:03:10 AM] Val Lapidus: the only categories that should exist are Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, and DAO, for us.
[8/28/23, 9:03:28 AM] Val Lapidus: we don't need to drill down any deeper into the breakdown then what i've described
[8/28/23, 9:04:56 AM] Anupa/diya: I would say we should factor in operational as it is important even in the preliminary stage
[8/28/23, 9:05:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Is this just for the website or are we going to be using this as a model
[8/28/23, 11:08:43 AM] Val Lapidus: Website
[8/28/23, 11:09:36 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm breaking it apart just like the world economic forum breaks it apart.  The world economic form does not list expenses like this.  So why would we, an infographic only makes sense if the items are expense are similar
[8/28/23, 11:54:03 AM] Gary Teh: You are correct. That is all under DAO
[8/28/23, 3:46:41 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 i've published the changes to: https://www.agroverse.shop/heart-healthy-cocoa-glazed-chinese-style-garlic-eggplant
[8/28/23, 6:24:12 PM] Anupa/diya: In that case we should have Marketing as a separate budget as a potential cost in the pie as stated.
[8/28/23, 6:26:39 PM] Val Lapidus: We don't have a marketing budget.  If we do in the future we can update this.  But the share will come out of the dao
[8/28/23, 6:27:59 PM] Val Lapidus: The way our structure works up to now is members tokenize their contribution towards a budget by exchanging dollar to tokens.  So if I was to spend $500 on marketing.  I would spend it out of my budget.  Then tokenize that money?  And thus the dao didn't spend anything on marketing other than tokens which is the equivalent of ownership shares.  We don't need to put anything for marketing now. In the future we can split up the dao share.  If we need to
[8/28/23, 6:39:19 PM] Anupa/diya: They are things been done on the marketing side which are getting tokenized now like the website and few other things. 

I think We should have a section called Marketing and Product design as a separate value and not added to the DAO.
[8/28/23, 6:43:28 PM] Val Lapidus: How do you quantify that as a percentage of the budget?  We don't have a true measurement of it and we don't have anything right now that points to how much that is actually costing us.  We leave it as part of the DAO right now.  Also, we want to make it look like we are not paying for marketing
[8/28/23, 6:44:51 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm all for radical transparency.  But what's the point of sticking our finger in the air and guessing?  The current numbers are the numbers that we can represent and show people that that is in fact what is happening
[8/28/23, 7:01:16 PM] Anupa/diya: Let's chat about this when we meet next so we can settle this
[8/28/23, 7:02:20 PM] Anupa/diya: As I said there are small number of marketing tokens which are been issued.
[8/28/23, 7:04:29 PM] Val Lapidus: If it's not easily convertible to Fiat, it's not measurable.  Tokens are not money.  They are shares of ownership?  This is not for the purpose of speaking to investors.  But for the purpose of marketing.
[8/28/23, 7:06:10 PM] Anupa/diya: I am aware of how it works. Web 3 marketing is a huge component and for investors  this will be area that they will look into
[8/28/23, 7:08:30 PM] Val Lapidus: So what is the concern that they don't see it broken down with a marketing budget. Shouldn't the DAO as a whole list it's marketing budget regardless of which product it's for? This breakdown is supposed to serve as proof that we are better than our competitors. With regards to how we split the profits with the farmer. The DAO itself on its website should list how much it spends on marketing.  But aggro verse doesn't do its own marketing
[8/28/23, 7:16:43 PM] Anupa/diya: Every project should function as an separate entity. That's the conversation we had in the initially. We can't group funding because it is not possible
[8/28/23, 7:17:35 PM] Val Lapidus: What percentage would you like to assign to marketing?
[8/28/23, 7:26:01 PM] Anupa/diya: We can set up a call and discuss
[8/28/23, 7:28:21 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 Just throw some random numbers in for now. 

I am sure we will start figuring out what it might be once we start executing the go to market strategy that @381642051030 is crafting 

My sense is if we are heading down the micro-influencer social marketing route as suggested by @381642051030 some of them will be very happy to receive governance tokens (1 TDG to 1USD) for their efforts creating videos and posting them to their followers 

As for others who are not, we will depriotize them until last resort (when DAO has fiat in our treasury). At that point we will know for sure how much fiat actually goes to marketing expenses

Also do note that it’s quite hard to amortize marketing expenses across the entire batch of all future bags of cacao nibs sold this is because of customer retention is strong (for example 100%), marketing budget associated with each bag sold will just end up tending towards zero as the same marketing dollar gets spread ever larger number of bags 

*Best case scenario*
Imagine a micro-influencer doing a one time video for governance tokens and it goes viral and then all target customers we will ever reach buys and retains 100%  

Marketing budget in this scenario is 0.

*worst case scenario*
DAO exhausted USD1 million on marketing. Zero bags sold. Everyone in the DAO went bankrupt. 

Then all the whole pie will just end up being marketing budget 🤣
[8/28/23, 7:29:44 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you have done your part by contributing the pie concept. Hands off for now

Let @918017107841 have her autonomy to do her stuff as she sees fit for website display
[8/28/23, 7:30:10 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s not waste time deliberating over what is the pie in the sky. 🙂🙏
[8/28/23, 7:32:15 PM] Val Lapidus: Agree put what number you want
[8/28/23, 7:32:53 PM] Anupa/diya: Marketing will be an integral part because we will have to factor in the roll out of the product. That has to come from funding. I can look into potential cacao nibs budgeting.  We should also look into someone who can be like CFO later on. We will need that 

It's better we look into all these things now in some what way because product pricing is key. 

I hope I can add more than random numbers 🤣🤣🤣
[8/28/23, 7:33:44 PM] Val Lapidus: If you are looking for me to give you a number I cannot.  Currently the number is zero.  Future it will be something.  I don't think we should base it off of other vendors but as I said put whatever number you want there ‎<This message was edited>
[8/28/23, 7:34:51 PM] Anupa/diya: We will have to look into some sort of product pricing..

[8/28/23, 7:51:40 PM] Val Lapidus: We had a meeting recently where we decided that the price will have to be $12 per 8 oz. Of cacao nibs.  That is what all these percentages are based off.  I specifically kept everything in percentages because we shouldn't attribute hard values to shares of the pie prices change and this is an abstract infographic
[8/28/23, 7:53:01 PM] Val Lapidus: Our current price is based entirely off of the price that our competitors are charging
[8/28/23, 8:46:57 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 see if your could use any of these existing footages

[8/28/23, 8:52:35 PM] Anupa/diya: We can just use the YouTube widget
[8/28/23, 8:52:44 PM] Gary Teh: You can auto translate the subtitles in YouTube
[8/28/23, 8:53:17 PM] Gary Teh: Or can get Matheus help to do so
[8/28/23, 8:53:44 PM] Anupa/diya: Some of them are not accurate but will try. Mathers can help.. this can be used for our marketing promos as well
[8/29/23, 9:22:42 AM] Val Lapidus: hi who is the graphic designer for our project
[8/29/23, 9:34:06 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 please reach out to @972543523823 

She is based in Amsterdam and is during the weekdays 

She will be happy to provide support during the weekends 

So have the request in as detail as possible sent over to her during the weekday 

Hopefully she could look into it on the weekend 

DM is generally more effective as she doesn’t really check the groups as much 🙂🙏
[8/29/23, 10:23:47 AM] Val Lapidus: I found a vendor that will do screen printing, 2 colors both sides in kraft compostable pouches.  the cost will be .15 per bag, 90$ for printing, and cost to ship to me
[8/29/23, 10:23:58 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm going to go with this vendor, rather than buy a printer
[8/29/23, 10:24:45 AM] Val Lapidus: I've asked our graphic designer via DM to give me a new image, with the required constraints
[8/29/23, 10:01:58 PM] Gary Teh: Looking forward to your support @972543523823 🙂🙏

Which would not only give us access to a space, but a captive audience that would sample the cacao nibs and give us feedback on the product.  He is going to get back to me later this week, if not early next

[9/3/23, 11:24:25 AM] Gary Teh: I was chatting with @5511982667030 about getting a farmers market stand in Sf so that we can conduct focus group every Sunday without even trying to recruit people since the foot traffic is naturally there
[9/3/23, 11:29:25 AM] Val Lapidus: Farmers market generally charge you for a stall
[9/3/23, 11:29:33 AM] Val Lapidus: The cost can be negligible but it adds up over time
[9/3/23, 11:29:45 AM] Val Lapidus: When we do a farmer's market we need to have all the marketing materials such as sign in information on how customers can get it
[9/3/23, 11:52:51 AM] Gary Teh: Might be the same things we need when we start doing the pop ups In sprouts, Whole Foods and Safeway

[9/4/23, 4:32:15 AM] Anupa/diya: Let me have a look
[9/4/23, 4:42:39 AM] Gary Teh: Here are my thoughts regarding go to market

*immediate*
    - Instagram official presence 

    - micro-influencers marketing (1000 to 10,000 followers)

*intermediate*
    - instagram shop: Wix allows integration into Instagram shop
    - Amazon shopfront 

*once we are sure of our supply chain*
    - Sprouts
    - Whole Foods 
    - Safeway
[9/4/23, 6:16:28 AM] Anupa/diya: @381642051030 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R5MWrJEonycTXHZ7lQMxkwq4qgJmM7xs Please have a look at the photos

[9/4/23, 6:19:13 AM] Anupa/diya: Are we doing shipping within the usa
[9/4/23, 6:19:18 AM] Anupa/diya: or other parts as well
[9/4/23, 6:22:08 AM] Gary Teh: Right now just within the USA 

Judging based on the shipping cost estimates from USA to other parts of the world, e.g. to @41796560010 Aga and Francois

The shipping cost is prohibitive 

If Switzerland does indeed have a lot of incoming request then it makes sense to setup an alternate supply chain that does not pass through USA but ships directly from Brazil

If such is the case then we will setup a packaging operation within Brazil
[9/4/23, 6:22:57 AM] Gary Teh: Shipping cost from Brazil to Switzerland is USd22.89
[9/4/23, 6:23:43 AM] Anupa/diya: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/4/23, 6:24:05 AM] Anupa/diya: we need to add that to the website somewhere
[9/4/23, 6:24:14 AM] Gary Teh: I am almost tempted to print our packaging in the USA in large bulk using the vendor that @16468233438 sourced for and fly into Brazil myself and transfer the printed packages to our packer

[9/4/23, 8:15:39 AM] Gary Teh: That might work too. We need to explore the cost.

[9/7/23, 8:27:05 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 had an idea for the happy hour, could buy a bunch of gift cards for coffee (philz or pete's) and give them out as a reward for sampling and giving feedback
[9/7/23, 8:35:39 AM] Gary Teh: That might work 🙂👊

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk6Q4HNWIF4tJLCvjsyMZ8UCqmZtDQN4J2HNp6W4N6s/edit

It ends up being a mini documentary series 

60 seconds for each clip
[9/7/23, 11:45:03 AM] Anupa/diya: All of this can feed into social media. Reel.. live .

But we will have this vendor print stickers and adhere those to the bag.  So we have full use of colors.  We can use your original design.  Just need to adjust it to a specific size

[9/20/23, 4:52:57 AM] Anupa/diya: the Brazilian government has launched a program called “Internet para Todos” (Internet for All) that aims to bring internet access to remote areas by building cell towers and laying fiber optic cables. Another barrier to internet access in rural Brazil is the cost of internet service.
[9/20/23, 4:52:58 AM] Anupa/diya: Mexico’s Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) announced this week that it would budget over MX$622.8M toward its “Internet for all” campaign in order to improve connectivity in Mexico. This project makes up one pillar of the five infrastructure projects set out by the ministry for this yea
[9/20/23, 4:52:58 AM] Anupa/diya: https://www.internetforall.gov/program/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program
[9/20/23, 4:55:07 AM] Anupa/diya: Many farmers have no access or very little access to internet. We should in parallel if we agree as a group look at internet access. There is no point of building a system where the key stakeholders have no access for say because there is no way they can be included due to no connectivity
[9/20/23, 5:02:29 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Hello to all. Happy to be involved in this guild. Exciting times.
[9/20/23, 5:03:05 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @918017107841 I used to distribute satellite internet in rural areas in Mexico for 2 years. We got bought out by a local provider in 2015/2016
[9/20/23, 5:03:11 AM] Vlatko Gigov: I know the landscape pretty well.
[9/20/23, 5:03:42 AM] Vlatko Gigov: As it happens to be, our vendor Hughes also operates satellite internet in Brazil 😜
[9/20/23, 5:03:58 AM] Anupa/diya: This is fantastic ! Gary needs this confirmation to send it to the authorities. We will need some kind of tech to suport this.
[9/20/23, 5:04:32 AM] Anupa/diya: Can we have a chat if you are free next week ?
[9/20/23, 5:08:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Definitely, I’m available beginning of the week. Have some pretty interesting concepts to share with you all. Gotta dust off my drive. 💪

[9/20/23, 9:27:17 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s see, maybe we can do a barter arrangement: internet for nibs. But we’ll discuss this on Monday. It’s important we move along the SDG’s and contribute to their communities.

If she gives thumbs up you get introduced by her to the business developer on the cooperative side 

I am not going to be involved

Only thing you need to let me know what is it that you contributed and which rubric category it falls under so that I can update ledger when I get time
[9/20/23, 10:46:12 AM] Gary Teh: Actually the local public/private institution (Cacao innovation center and Sol du Bahia) are already providing the requirement confirmation 

And we have agreed to go with them for FDA requirements 

They mentioned they are open to donations and are registered as charity in USA for tax write offs
[9/20/23, 10:58:38 AM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/20/23, 11:00:10 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 presale on the Agroverse website needs to be changed.  

Shipment is coming in end of this month 

I also noticed the outstanding copy writing errors on our website that Mukiri surfaced is still not rectified yet after two weeks 

Do let me know if you have bandwidth to tackle it

If not, I will seek out another DaO member who has ability and bandwidth to join our guild to tackle that portion and invite you out from this guild. 🙂🙏

[9/21/23, 2:28:56 AM] Gary Teh: I showed our site to Emelin, she immediately identified a bunch of factual errors 

I have shared our wix credentials with her. She mentioned she will spend sometime next few days to rectify them in exchange for governance tokens
[9/21/23, 2:33:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Thats great
[9/21/23, 2:34:22 AM] Anupa/diya: If she can give some more content to drive the website - that would be great
[9/21/23, 2:39:04 AM] Gary Teh: @41799155602 I think I really need to invite you out of this guild after much thinking 

It’s only for operatives 

Right now you are just in the financing side 🙂🙏
[9/21/23, 2:39:14 AM] Vlatko Gigov: ‎You removed Vlatko Gigov
[9/21/23, 2:45:55 AM] Anupa/diya: @14153000019 since you wrote most of the text, it's best you check with her on what are the factual points. I can send the website text on a document.  She can edit and add
[9/21/23, 2:46:27 AM] Anupa/diya: The text has been added but some of the tech stuff is inbuilt wix layout
[9/21/23, 2:48:18 AM] Gary Teh: She has access to wix 

She can edit there directly
[9/21/23, 2:48:52 AM] Gary Teh: Her background is in UX design 

She should be able to figure things out
[9/21/23, 2:49:56 AM] Anupa/diya: Does she have access photos which we can use on the website

[9/21/23, 3:23:37 AM] Gary Teh: When is the ETA? 

That way we can know when this task item is completed? 

Production is coming online 

This is item is now on the critical path

[9/21/23, 3:59:19 PM] Val Lapidus: maybe option 3, but the distrobution needs to align, so it can be compared: ie: farmer should be farmer, transportation by transportaiton
[9/21/23, 3:59:43 PM] Val Lapidus: more callout that marketing is not something we do
[9/21/23, 4:01:08 PM] Val Lapidus: please let me know if any one has any other feedback

[9/21/23, 4:17:11 PM] Gary Teh: Hey folks please welcome @557191035605 who is based here in Ilheus who is very familiar with local customs here in Ilheus 

@557191035605 will help correct the factual errors we find here on the Agroverse.shop website 🙂🙏
[9/21/23, 4:18:20 PM] Val Lapidus: going to provide following feedback to designer: Option 3, but with following adjustments: 

There needs to be something that points out that we don't have marketing/retailer costs with Agroverse model, I know it's difficult to represent 0 in physical form, so if you want to assign a value of .5% to Retailer/Marketing respectively you can take one away from the DAO.

The order for the items needs to be same: 
major distro model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer, Marketing
agroverse model order should be: Farmer, Transportation, Packaging, Retailer (0%), Marketing (0%), DAO.

The coloring for each needs to match so for Farmer in both models, should have same color, Trasport in both models should have same color, and etc....  We want people to be easily able to compare.  I'm actually not sure about this one, so you can give me two options one where colors from item to item align, and one where it doesn't.

Thank you.

[9/24/23, 3:33:40 PM] Gary Teh: This is how I am right now thinking about how the various marketing channels

    - LinkedIn: Attract more supporters who will contribute time and effort to build out Agroverse project
    - Instagram Official Account: Attract buyers to our official website
    - Instagram micro-influencer accounts: Attract buyers to our official website
    - TikTok micro-influencers accounts: Attract buyers to our official website
    - Amazon.com: organic buyers based on keyword optimization to our store front on Amazon.com

[9/28/23, 10:05:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We don't have a specific page on the section "About Us". It lays on the home. Maybe it will be too large for what we have right now (wide image). So I will need to come up with content to explain this infographic, or else it will be just a colourful image floating there.
[9/28/23, 10:06:12 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @16468233438 it would be great to have you for the meeting today. So I can show the things I am working on as well.
[9/28/23, 10:14:03 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @16468233438 I took over the site content and the visual gaps. I've been prioritizing the content and the font changes. But I have been doing other changes in the home. I still need to check who it changes format depending on the computer, as it was Wix was supposed to be responsive. As it was not made "mobile first", I will need to fix the mobile later as well.
[9/28/23, 10:40:35 AM] Gary Teh: Hi @557191035605 

@16468233438 is focused on the operations side of things
    - vendors 
    - packaging
    - logistics and shipping
    - storage

The session this afternoon happening within the @120363171654864846@g.us is focused on social media market. Let's not drag him into that session. 🙂🙏
[9/28/23, 10:48:28 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok. Thanks for mentioning he is in logistics.

I am proceeding to do the merge now

[9/29/23, 1:54:48 PM] Gary Teh: Sure let’s chat on Monday 

I should be back in sf by then 🙂🙏
[9/29/23, 1:55:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Deal! :)
[9/29/23, 1:55:47 PM] Gary Teh: I will be over at @16468233438 place. Would be great to get him introduced to the both of you as well.
[9/29/23, 1:56:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I really like those groups meetings 🤗
[9/29/23, 1:58:32 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 would you have time to meet on Monday morning?
I believe both 
@557191035605 and @557391090002 are available between 8am and 11am.
[9/29/23, 2:01:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: After lunch Brazilian time, right?

[9/29/23, 2:02:46 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 12:30
[9/29/23, 2:03:00 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 you should try to pop into the Monday session as well. As that would probably help inform some of the program items you want to include in your Official Instagram account programming (to promote the social sharing by project supporters)
[9/29/23, 2:03:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I eat in 30 min 😬
[9/29/23, 2:03:27 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! So 1:30pm?
[9/29/23, 2:03:42 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Deal!
[9/29/23, 2:04:10 PM] Gary Teh: I will send out the invite
[9/29/23, 2:07:14 PM] Val Lapidus: 9/930 both work
[9/29/23, 2:08:24 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect. I have sent out the invite for 930am California and 130pm Brazil

[9/30/23, 10:42:23 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 could you share the link to the 10K followers account you created and the heuristics you followed?
[9/30/23, 10:47:59 AM] Suheil - Europe: Wts heuristic hhhh
[9/30/23, 10:48:45 AM] Suheil - Europe: So what we tell peolple: stop using nestle back up agroverse?🤣🤣
[9/30/23, 10:49:11 AM] Suheil - Europe: I don't create anything I'm only a maestro 🤣🤣
[9/30/23, 10:49:51 AM] Suheil - Europe: I only know how to source the right team mate for executing hhhh https://instagram.com/stocken_ar?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==
[9/30/23, 10:50:30 AM] Gary Teh: I see. Then you are not the operator dude you are just the sourcer 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 10:51:07 AM] Gary Teh: Who was doing the actual execution for that account?
[9/30/23, 10:52:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: Auto scheduler  app

All we needed is to sit once a month , 2 of us and upload all months content according to our p2p activity 


It's not by just posting the post on Instagram that alone came traffic

With each post going out we were all over telegram groups communities dispersing the link ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 10:54:33 AM] Suheil - Europe: Before opening the insta page we spent half a year only networking with related communities and gaining trust and credibility :)
[9/30/23, 10:55:16 AM] Suheil - Europe: Dispersing the projects pages in many conferences
[9/30/23, 10:55:18 AM] Suheil - Europe: Meet ups
[9/30/23, 10:55:20 AM] Suheil - Europe: Events
[9/30/23, 10:55:57 AM] Gary Teh: Now the key question is how many of these telegram groups actually have people who follow keto diet or nutrition healthy lifestyle 

And more importantly based in USA

We might end up barking up the wrong tree hitting the groups and meetups ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 10:57:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: Not relevant at all 


I just gave u example of how
[9/30/23, 10:58:36 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s listen to what @557391090002 has to share this coming Monday 

Incorporate his input into a full scale social marketing strategy

Then the Monday after next you walk us through what you came up with ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 10:59:48 AM] Suheil - Europe: You want the client


Client is in US

Well we should penetrate US based dieto keto sports groups communities if it was fb
Telegram
Go to a gym event meet-up like during tasters that would've been ideal to push people to Instagram or any other online
[9/30/23, 11:01:25 AM] Suheil - Europe: My easiest way was always "attacking " conferences with QR code on my phone throwing it at everyone and anyone for people to like follow ect...
[9/30/23, 11:07:39 AM] Gary Teh: I think every account of a sort Instagram/ Facebook or any social media platform has its own unique form of expression.

At the end of the day is expression “Marketing”

The key I’ll recommend will be **“how/which” aspects *** you’ll like to “show” integrate the product in this case “Agroverse” to the public. 

Keep it simple and send the message out there for the public. If is to sell an image, if is to give to others the product benefits or to put out there a message to the world community !

**Ex: trees 🌳 cocoa 🫘 local’s displayed of product and regional growth details of its made of origin, ** 
as we all know todays world we mainly are thriving to be organic in all aspects in life in this case “ agroverse” agriculture 👩🏻‍🌾
[9/30/23, 11:09:15 AM] Gary Teh: @13054848967 I finally found time to read through what you posted about Instagram account management 

Would you mind further expanding on what you have already shared so far?

Also do you think you might be able to join our Monday zoom hangout session 

@557391090002 will be sharing his thoughts 

I would like for you to share yours too 

That way when @31641075825 compiles the plan it’s comprehensive
‎[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: If is cocoa only cocoa pictures and videos not with pineapple 🍍 or bananas or recipes. I think focus is ideal on only cocoa images
[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: Imágenes has to sell the product.
[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: Is cocoa and agriculture 👩🏻‍🌾 documentaries
[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: Recipes will be on add “stories” or just top 5.

The main focus is cocoa and cocoa bean 🫘

[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: Question should the Instagram marketing etc social medias be more “commercialized” like Starbucks etc or ….. “environmental” conservatives of agriculture like charts dry outs.
[9/30/23, 11:11:24 AM] Gary Teh: If is to sell product has to be commercialize but depending on The aspect your aiming for

[9/30/23, 11:23:08 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 have you already read the document that Iris created priorly

It’s has a week by week break down on the general tasks items to execute upon 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SFaC65kSptU7rHSiM0F6sGOVlUxi3_Cs7QX2fU7cjs/edit

Could you take a look before Monday so that on Monday we can figure out what else is missing or should be tweaked from that one
[9/30/23, 3:14:10 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[9/30/23, 3:51:42 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 we will need to find time to consider the following next week

*item 1: return policy*
How do we handle when a customer bought a bag of cacao nibs is not satisfied and wants a return?

*item 2*
Recall policy, when we are issued a notice for recall by FDA for issues they have identified
[9/30/23, 3:21:00 PM] Suheil - Europe: I did not I will make sure to do before our Monday 🙏
[9/30/23, 4:14:47 PM] Gary Teh: Please come prepared as you are planning to play the role maestro on the social media marketing side, it becomes your responsibility to incorporate into your mental model all the inputs from other DAO members regarding this matter and weigh the proposer option forward
‎[9/30/23, 4:36:47 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[9/30/23, 6:15:19 PM] Val Lapidus: 1: Give money back.  Keep product.
2: we need to track shipping date with lot number to ensure traceability
[9/30/23, 6:17:29 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes still have
[9/30/23, 6:44:58 PM] Gary Teh: Dang! 

number 1: for every refund we have to sell 5 to cover the cost of 1 refund 

We will go broke really fast like this
[9/30/23, 6:46:01 PM] Gary Teh: Also what is to prevent a buyer from just exploiting the system and draining our vault dry like this?
[9/30/23, 6:48:12 PM] Gary Teh: If I were a hacker I would do precisely that 

Order all the available inventory and then ask for everything to be returned. So I get all my money back and then keep the inventory

We are dealing with web3 folks some of whom are mentally geared towards hacking of all forms to draft DAO vaults ‎<This message was edited>
[9/30/23, 7:29:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Not much else we can do here.  We can say we don't accept refunds
[9/30/23, 7:29:34 PM] Val Lapidus: If we notice a trend we can ban a customer
[9/30/23, 7:30:05 PM] Val Lapidus: I hope no one orders all inventory
[9/30/23, 8:57:27 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s go with that first

[10/1/23, 1:29:05 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think we need to create a seperate whats app channel, that will not allow any conversation, but will act as a repository for all FDA compliance items required by the FDA.  Or we could do a google group / folder
[10/1/23, 1:30:36 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎This message was deleted.
[10/1/23, 1:49:18 PM] Val Lapidus: to comply with FSMA standards we will need the following items, As I come across more items I will edit and update this post:

HACCP plan
Lot records for each individual imported item, with details of origin
shipping/receiving/storage logs
Lot #ing system: XXX-TTTT
XXX: uniq 3 digit ID of source farm *we should publish our FARM ID's to our website
TTTT: 2 digit month/2 digit year of receipt to US based warehousing
We need to retain a small amount (4-8 oz) of product from every lot #, that we can then utilize for testing.
A process document detailing how the product is packaged at farm, how it is shipped, how it is received in the US, How it is stored in the US upon receipt, how it is then taken to a commercial kitchen to be repackaged, how it is then stored, and then how it is shipped.
[10/1/23, 1:54:25 PM] Gary Teh: I have created a GitHub repository to store all food safety records

The wrong crowd is those we call the nature loving *tree huggers* aka the hippies. Most of them are f**king broke. Aka Steve Jobs before Apple was founded 

The folks we should be targeting are the *biohackers* the hard charging high tech executives that really want to optimize the use of their time, energy and resources with lots of cash to throw around. Aka Steve Jobs after Apple was founded ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/23, 3:38:54 PM] Gary Teh: We are already registered with the FDA as an importer

A document that defines our process for personelle requirements, that details: personal protective gear: beard covers, gloves, mask, hair net.  
requirements related to personal hygene, no open sores or legions unless covered by an impermeable covering, hand washing, no jewelery, no storing of clothing/personal belongins not in areas where food is exposed or equiments is washed, no eating, chewing gum, using tobaco, or smoking in those areas either.
For storage Need to create a log book for checking our storage facility: Checking on a regular basis for pests and pest infestation (unclear what a regular basis is)

[10/4/23, 11:09:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It would be nice to get something between still real and not so much of a mockup color.

[10/5/23, 3:37:55 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 when you get the chance could you update the tasting notes for the Santa Fe ana and the Cooperative Cabruca samples on this tasting note document?

[10/6/23, 4:43:01 PM] Gary Teh: Once Val finished collecting the data within the next two hours we will know which variant of cacao nibs we will be going with and which logo we will be using
[10/6/23, 4:44:34 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Nice. I'm anxious :) So I can add to the brand guide
[10/6/23, 4:44:43 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I need it as soon as you finish :)

[10/6/23, 5:08:04 PM] Val Lapidus: 5 people for 9 5 for 8
[10/6/23, 5:08:40 PM] Val Lapidus: I think we should with this shipment.  Purchase both. In order to sell number 9. We have to redo our packaging
[10/6/23, 5:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: We should purchase 100 kilos of number eight utilize our available packaging.  And then change our packaging to accommodate for number nine
[10/6/23, 5:12:37 PM] Gary Teh: Huh. I am confused by your text 

#9: how many KG?
#8: how many KG?
[10/6/23, 5:13:00 PM] Val Lapidus: 100 each
[10/6/23, 5:14:04 PM] Gary Teh: Are you sure you have enough storage in our Californian facility?

Why not the following?

#9: 50Kg
#8: 50Kg ‎<This message was edited>
[10/6/23, 5:15:22 PM] Gary Teh: Also 
    *Item 1* - Brazilian side is not expecting 200kg for shipment #2

Let’s go as we have planned according to our ramp up schedule ‎<This message was edited>
[10/6/23, 5:23:25 PM] Val Lapidus: Then I think we need to do number eight 100 kilos
[10/6/23, 5:23:30 PM] Val Lapidus: Because our packaging is not made for number 9
[10/6/23, 5:39:20 PM] Gary Teh: So for shipment #2?

#8: 100kg
#9: 0kg ‎<This message was edited>

[10/6/23, 6:23:38 PM] Gary Teh: Let’s do

#8 - 50Kg 

We should give #9 and #8 separate names to help consumers differentiate between the two of them

Let’s chat on Monday
[10/6/23, 8:19:34 PM] Val Lapidus: We will need to order new packaging.  Or put stickers covering current
[10/6/23, 8:20:16 PM] Gary Teh: Maybe just put a sticker. But first figure out what is the differentiation

[10/9/23, 10:39:49 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I have a question...I saw the two products bags, one Premium and the other would be the regular, right? Don't they have any color difference or a label "Premium"? I ask this because I noticed in the Agroverse shop page it was not mentioned in the title as well.
[10/9/23, 10:40:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔
[10/9/23, 10:40:24 AM] Gary Teh: This is because premium is just speculation right now. We are not rolling that out yet. Needs more market research. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/9/23, 8:35:41 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 I was thinking through our marketing

At the top of the marketing funnel, It’s basically about getting the most *amount of eyeballs* on our messaging using the *least amount of resources* 

The recipe that most naturally fits the bill is *controversy* 

What is the most extreme, most controversial, most polarizing and yet still factually correct and relevant piece of messaging we can use to get the Agroverse story out there?

We really don’t want to spend all our time and effort coming up with messaging that basically triggers off *zero emotional response* ‎<This message was edited>

Marketing materials we will need
    - poster 1: benefits of drinking cacao during network session 
    - poster 2: about Agroverse and TrueSight DAO
    - poster 3: Call to action: 
        - buy our cacao

[10/10/23, 5:14:59 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think something we will need to do to get our product to be searchable on Amazon, is buy it ourselves a few hundred times.  Amazon algorithms prioritize best sellers in searches.  so if we can get each DAO member to make a purchase, then we will refund them their purchase (if they want to be refunded) *if not they should get DAO tokens* then this will certainly drive up our search in Amazon.
[10/10/23, 5:15:19 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to make sure that we do it steadily though.
[10/10/23, 5:15:48 PM] Val Lapidus: there is an algorithm to how Amazon does this, I have a friend that I would like to consult with us on this
[10/10/23, 5:15:58 PM] Gary Teh: Yes! That is exactly what is my mind just now 

We will kick start that campaign as soon as we get the final parts of our listings fixed

The more aligned vision people have about the Agroverse, the better for the brand. What I am about to comment is based on what I've read so far and understood by the documentation and the uses of certain terminologies. If you feel we should discuss it further, I will be happy to help.
[10/11/23, 8:59:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I was asked a paragraph about Agroverse. So I went to the whitepaper and the site.

[10/11/23, 9:01:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: If I make a fusion of what is in the paper and what is in the site (that has a more selling interest because we talk about the product right now) I have this:
[10/11/23, 9:01:44 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Agroverse is a transparent direct-to-consumer agricultural distribution network that connects small-scale farmers in developing societies with people around the world who are concerned about the environment, their health, and sustainability. We have emerged out of the necessity to rethink food consumption and the commitment to work together with economically disadvantaged production communities, transforming the agricultural economy into a collaborative endeavor.
[10/11/23, 9:02:08 AM] Gary Teh: I have also granted you access to the white paper 🙂🙏

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3JiawnqA1QNpA_XZMH6oNQ9ZVJnLRGtOWzM31YLvJs/edit
[10/11/23, 9:03:03 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I changed the small-scale farmers - international market to people who are interested in the environment, their health and sustainability. We use words as: community, building something together, so connecting farmers to people worldwide speaks more of community than farmers- international market.
[10/11/23, 9:03:35 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩🙏
[10/11/23, 9:04:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The second point is the term "marginalized". It can be seen as a problem due to developed countries and underdeveloping and developed ones historical perspective. So I think we should avoid using this world in the company context.
[10/11/23, 9:04:40 AM] Gary Teh: Ok! Let’s remove it 🙂🙏
[10/11/23, 9:04:52 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎This message was deleted.
[10/11/23, 9:05:07 AM] Gary Teh: How about vulnerable??
[10/11/23, 9:05:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: d*
[10/11/23, 9:05:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: "marginalized small scale farmers"
[10/11/23, 9:05:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: They are not vulnerable.
[10/11/23, 9:05:58 AM] Gary Teh: What is a good term to use?
[10/11/23, 9:06:11 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Vulnarable: need of special care, support, or protection because of age, disability, or risk of abuse or neglect."
[10/11/23, 9:06:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It still gets the idea of "we are a rich country helping the poor"
[10/11/23, 9:06:42 AM] Emelin - Bahia: That is from where in my opinion, Agroverse has to run from.
[10/11/23, 9:06:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is not a NGO.
[10/11/23, 9:07:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So to hear that a company is helping the vulnerable in South America but profiting from this, can be a thing.
[10/11/23, 9:07:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Due to historical relationships.
[10/11/23, 9:07:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will be adding this to the brand guide so we all stay on the same page and don't jeopardize the company's image by misinformation.
[10/11/23, 9:08:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is also a voice and tone thing to add.
[10/11/23, 9:08:53 AM] Gary Teh: Perfect! Please also feel free to remove inappropriate terminologies from our Agroverse whitepaper

You have editing rights to that too 🙂🙏
[10/11/23, 9:09:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We can use: Disadvantaged communities or economically disadvantaged communities.
[10/11/23, 9:09:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: because we are talking about the farmers.
[10/11/23, 9:09:23 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s use disadvantaged
[10/11/23, 9:09:49 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is respectful.
[10/11/23, 9:10:06 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok I will
[10/11/23, 9:12:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Done V

Me and @16468233438 were chatting about how we should be supporting the civilians of both Isreal and Palestine

However seems like there is already alot of support for the civilians in Isreal, we figured we should balance things out alittle by offering support for folks in Palestine

[10/13/23, 2:38:11 PM] Gary Teh: Just you and myself for now.
[10/13/23, 2:38:37 PM] Val Lapidus: My guess is will probably need a minimum order
[10/13/23, 2:38:37 PM] Gary Teh: If we gain more traction with our cacao nibs, we can print more t-Shirts for supporters that get recruited
[10/13/23, 2:40:32 PM] Gary Teh: How much is minimum order?

[10/13/23, 2:42:34 PM] Val Lapidus: Never mind. There's no minimum order. It's going to be about 20 per shirt
[10/13/23, 2:42:40 PM] Val Lapidus: That may not include the cost of the shirt
[10/13/23, 2:42:48 PM] Val Lapidus: Whoever is designing the shirt, they need to know that it's for screen printing
[10/13/23, 2:43:08 PM] Val Lapidus: Sanmar.com is where you can find the shirts that we can use

[10/16/23, 5:30:36 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 direct this question formally to Orlantildes (the president of the coop) when you get introduced to him on Wednesday 

If you want to do an informal query about Bahia infrastructure ask @557391090002. He handles business development for the coop

There are facilities for this in Bahia to handle it

@5511982667030 gate keeps the interfacing between our organization and the cooperative to ensure Orlantildes does not get flooded by informal unstructured requests 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

Brand guide
[10/19/23, 3:03:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The idea is to follow a pattern to create consistency.
[10/19/23, 3:04:27 PM] Suheil - Europe: requested access
[10/19/23, 3:05:22 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Approved.
[10/19/23, 3:09:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019  If you guys need me to talk with the graphic designer in order to arrange and check if the posts are aligned to the brand, just tell me. I don't mind helping with this. On monday I will be full hands with the mobile. But I would be happy to check if everything is ok with the design. :)
[10/19/23, 3:09:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Gotta have dinner now :D

[10/20/23, 10:16:31 AM] Val Lapidus: re-boiling now
[10/20/23, 10:29:23 AM] Val Lapidus: @557191035605 I love the idea of the tribal face paint that sounds amazing
[10/20/23, 10:37:07 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 anyway for us to borrow a tablet??
[10/20/23, 10:37:46 AM] Val Lapidus: I think I have one
[10/20/23, 10:37:59 AM] Val Lapidus: Do we need a table?
[10/20/23, 10:39:24 AM] Val Lapidus: we will have to do cheese cloth straining
[10/20/23, 10:39:27 AM] Val Lapidus: it's still gritty
[10/20/23, 10:55:30 AM] Gary Teh: To be safe let’s bring a table

Or actually what will be really fun is to give our free hot chocolate drink along ocean beach one of these weekends around sunset time wearing our T-Shirt.
[10/20/23, 1:05:37 PM] Val Lapidus: Or we could do samples and sell?
[10/20/23, 1:05:59 PM] Gary Teh: Give samples and sell the bags!! 🤩

[10/21/23, 12:04:18 PM] Val Lapidus: Feedback from last night:
We need to align on which CTA(s) we are testing or trying to convey.  Subscription? Purchase? Recruitment?

The CTA should be aligned to who the audience is.  If it's tech people, we should be recruiting.  

If the CTA is buy or follow, the actual product should be sampled and used.  Our product is cacao, we need to give samples of the nibs.  Hot chocolate can be an enticer, but isn't what we are selling.

We should not be talking about how the coco nibs won awards.  When we are not selling those.

We need to ensure with the host that we will be given time to announce before or after.

We need to ensure our placement is to greet people as they walk in.  We were at the very end of the venue, which caused people to come in and block the path to get to us.  

We need to think about bringing a different product.  Cacao nibs are a niche product and may be a difficult sell.
[10/21/23, 12:05:26 PM] Gary Teh: But should we be recruiting instead of selling to Tech People?
[10/21/23, 12:05:59 PM] Val Lapidus: Yes if it's tech our goal should be follow insta or recruit
[10/21/23, 12:06:50 PM] Gary Teh: I think we should just focus our CTA on selling. When I ran my own prior growth experiments having two conflict CTAs causes conversion rate to drop by 75%
[10/21/23, 12:07:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Selling what?
[10/21/23, 12:07:11 PM] Gary Teh: ‎You deleted this message.
[10/21/23, 12:07:19 PM] Gary Teh: Cacao nibs
[10/21/23, 12:07:32 PM] Val Lapidus: Did we have cacao nibs with us? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:07:52 PM] Val Lapidus: How are we selling a product if we aren't allowing people to see/touch it
[10/21/23, 12:07:59 PM] Gary Teh: Yesterday no. Let's try to prepare 5 bags for each of the 2 events.

We can use from the 5kg we currently have just to test conversion rate ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: Why do you think we will achieve sales within a group of tech people gathered for an event that that has nothing to do with our product?
[10/21/23, 12:10:00 PM] Gary Teh: I think we need to figure out a short script that we just stick to that works. 

Otherwise if we want to scale this event if and when it works, getting professional folks who are skilled in delivering scripts versus getting random folks who don't need to deliver scripts is way way harder.
[10/21/23, 12:10:42 PM] Val Lapidus: Before we can settle on a scrip we need to align on our primary goal
[10/21/23, 12:10:55 PM] Gary Teh: No harm trying. Otherwise no reason even for us to be there at the event. We are already able to get contributors without sponsoring events, why drive up our fiat operating expenses?

Also there arent really alot of slots where engineering contributors can come into contribute in our DAO right now ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:11:05 PM] Gary Teh: Sell
[10/21/23, 12:12:27 PM] Val Lapidus: I am saying that we won't get sales here but we should use this to gain followers, and get interest in how we are using tech within the project
[10/21/23, 12:12:59 PM] Gary Teh: Get them on the instagram. The goal is to eventually convert them to buyers
[10/21/23, 12:13:10 PM] Val Lapidus: For tech events Our CTA should be followers on insta.  And our main point should be how we use the blockchain
[10/21/23, 12:13:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Followers get us exposure.  Exposure gets us sales
[10/21/23, 12:14:14 PM] Gary Teh: My sense is tech approach is too boring
[10/21/23, 12:14:53 PM] Val Lapidus: Your excitement to get sales at these events does not make sense.  As you pointed out within your feedback.  The person I suggested should purchase was uncomfortable but then you mention give us a follow, and they were receptive
[10/21/23, 12:14:56 PM] Gary Teh: I haven't heard anyone from last night coming to me asking about how the tech part of the project actually works. They are all mainly interested in finding out about the farmers and how we got pass the legal side as well as the sourcing side
[10/21/23, 12:15:23 PM] Gary Teh: Let me clarify

First physical contact > instagram follow > Sales

That is the funnel I am referring to when I mean sales ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:15:45 PM] Val Lapidus: Sure so our cta is followers
[10/21/23, 12:16:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok so what should ouressage be
[10/21/23, 12:16:10 PM] Val Lapidus: Message
[10/21/23, 12:16:34 PM] Gary Teh: I am not interested in this funnel for our in real life events

First physical contact > instagram follow > Contributors

We are getting inbound people curious and interested without doing In real life events ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:18:20 PM] Val Lapidus: I suggest we talk about the actual value of using the blockchain.  And I'm sorry you think it's boring.  It's not.  It's actual utility of the blockchain, that few people know.  People who I spoke to loved the ledger as the mechanisim for tracivility.  At least 6 people asked for more info
[10/21/23, 12:19:22 PM] Gary Teh: These are the two I just pulled out from my ass. Feel free to throw in more.

    > Chocolate that helps you get in shape
    > Enough with the sugared water, taste real chocolate
[10/21/23, 12:19:22 PM] Val Lapidus: And your secondary message should be the logistical aspect and legal aspect
[10/21/23, 12:19:39 PM] Gary Teh: Just throw in CTAs you have in mind, we will subject it to DAO voting
We will pick the top two that gets the most vote and stick it to the containers

    - one on Thursday
    - one on Friday ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:20:54 PM] Val Lapidus: I immediately vote against those two: 

The two messages I think we should push:

Use blockchain for tracking
Legal aspects of import

Leading to: 
Follow us on insta ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:23:29 PM] Gary Teh: Since we have two events, let's just do one version on Thursday and one version on Friday

We will see how many people scan on each day. Its simple
[10/21/23, 12:23:40 PM] Gary Teh: Demographic is quite similar
‎[10/21/23, 12:24:34 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 12:25:29 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎POLL:
Which messaging should we use at events with technical attendees, to drive insta followers
‎OPTION: Healthier food with no sugar/healthier you (1 vote)
‎OPTION: We use blockchain technology/elements involved in import/export (1 vote)

[10/21/23, 12:46:01 PM] Val Lapidus: We need to focus on audience fit.  These people are tech.  If you want to drive sales the. Events we should go to are keto meetups/events.  Not ones that we created, but we need to contact existing and get them to allow to sponsor.  Going to tech events and trying to sell a product that they have not expressed interest in is a futile exercise reminiscent of Sisyphus
[10/21/23, 12:46:40 PM] Gary Teh: Shall I just let them know that we are cancelling sponsorship for those two events then?

There are only techies in the bay area ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:48:26 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't know. I don't think you should. I think we need to realign what what are messaging and CTA is?  And I disagree with you. The Bay area does not have just techies.  And also the group of techies and keto followers is not mutually exclusive.  But keto does not necessarily have a high level of intersection with techie
‎[10/21/23, 12:52:14 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 12:53:13 PM] Gary Teh: Let's just test 1 CTA on Thursday and the other on Friday. 
I see it as an AB test
We will go with whichever CTA that better converts at this tech events.

Goal: *get more instagram followers*

More time is wasted on agonizing over which option is better than just simply testing two and then moving on quickly. I have seen this happen many times before in growth teams ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 12:59:45 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok
[10/21/23, 12:59:54 PM] Val Lapidus: So Thursday will be which?
[10/21/23, 1:02:39 PM] Gary Teh: Let's do yours first. Its friendly territory since its basically the web3 crowd at Edge and Node
[10/21/23, 1:03:12 PM] Gary Teh: The folks at HackerDojo mentioned they haven't heard anybody talk about cryptocurrency at all for the past 6 months.
[10/21/23, 1:08:00 PM] Val Lapidus: Maybe hacker dojo would be a better venue if they haven't heard it for 6 months. Maybe it's time to rehash
[10/21/23, 1:08:41 PM] Gary Teh: 👊
[10/21/23, 1:08:56 PM] Val Lapidus: Also, FYI. Other issue that I have with your message.  Is when delivering a message of a healthier you. I'm not the right person to deliver that message.
[10/21/23, 1:09:05 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't exactly look like the pinnacle of health
[10/21/23, 1:09:45 PM] Gary Teh: How much weigh have you lost so far?

Just say my friend gary convinced me to go on this keto cacao experiment

I have lost X lb so far after Y number of weeks. 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
‎[10/21/23, 1:10:35 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 1:12:31 PM] Val Lapidus: See I could see that working but there needs to be an actual story of how cacao is actually helping.  And it has to be an honest story
[10/21/23, 1:12:55 PM] Val Lapidus: Right now all the cacao is doing is keeping my stress level high
[10/21/23, 1:13:21 PM] Gary Teh: That bad??
[10/21/23, 1:13:41 PM] Val Lapidus: Nah I can manage
[10/21/23, 1:13:52 PM] Gary Teh: What about using cacao to supplement your diet since its rich in saturated fat?
[10/21/23, 1:14:28 PM] Val Lapidus: We have to do research on this and find the right talking points for it. I don't mind doing it but we need to further expand on this and be able to talk about why this is better
‎[10/21/23, 1:15:21 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/21/23, 1:17:53 PM] Gary Teh: or perhaps the story would be you are trying to adopt a healthier diet by cutting out sugar and caffiene which is what I observe you already doing and you did use cacao powder in your cooking the last few times I was there

Also this cacao drink does not include sugar ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/23, 1:21:08 PM] Val Lapidus: I prefer not to use bulletproof as the mechanism. Bulletproof diet is a fad and widely regarded as b******* by the medical community.  There is some evidence about utilizing certain types of fats to help control hunger in the mainstream community

[10/22/23, 3:25:55 AM] Suheil - Europe: my input on piing pong of CTA at events.

Offline event is to build the community. if its a web3 tech event then i am gearing more towards val that it not about selling them the cacaao nibs . it is about pitching our real life use case of how we , as “on-chain” community following DAO principles and bootstrapping a traditional business by contributions. how we are doing it today vs how we envision scalability using deep tech such as blockchain / AI ….

it is not about “recruiting” engineers to come code for truesight or agroverse. it’s about raising awareness how we leverage tech for x y z reasons…

[10/22/23, 8:43:35 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! 🤩
[10/22/23, 8:51:20 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 maybe what we should think about is.  At the farmers market we sell hot chocolate as well.  We can calculate our cost per cup and put a significant markup on it.
[10/22/23, 8:51:52 AM] Val Lapidus: We can give out samples of the hot chocolate.

[10/22/23, 8:56:24 AM] Val Lapidus: Ty. The cuteness comes from his mom
[10/22/23, 9:03:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: From both, I am sure 🙏🏾
[10/22/23, 9:15:49 AM] Val Lapidus: @557191035605 I know there is a recipe for hot chocolate that has cayane pepper 🌶️ in it.  Do you happen to know it?
[10/22/23, 9:16:25 AM] Val Lapidus: (yes I know how to Google, but I would prefer to get an idea of something authentic from Brazil)
[10/22/23, 9:18:36 AM] Val Lapidus: If I make this recipe and someone asks me:  how did you learn about this.  I can respond with "I googled it". Or a much better and captivating response would be, this recipe comes from one of the contributors to the agroverse community, Emelin, who lives in brazil.  It is a recipe that has been passed down for 12 generations ‎<This message was edited>
[10/22/23, 9:23:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I have eaten solid chocolate with pepper. It is so good 🥹
[10/22/23, 9:25:19 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I don't have a recipe from my 12th generation with pepper. But it is as famous as Brazil having a whole soap opera called "chocolate with pepper"
[10/22/23, 9:25:54 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is more common to eat it than drink it here in northeast.
[10/22/23, 9:26:01 AM] Emelin - Bahia: But Brazil is huge.
[10/22/23, 9:26:27 AM] Val Lapidus: @557391090002 do you have a secret hot chocolate recipe that your grandmother passed down to you?
[10/22/23, 9:26:39 AM] Val Lapidus: I totally understand. Thank you!
[10/22/23, 9:27:06 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Hot drinks are more common in cold places. Although we do consume a lot of coffee
[10/22/23, 9:30:33 AM] Val Lapidus: Do we know anyone in the south of Brazil? It gets cold there right?

[10/22/23, 5:51:05 PM] Gary Teh: How do you know its not Photoshop?? 🤔🤣
[10/22/23, 5:51:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Based on the original design of the t-shirts that you came up with, I know that it's not Photoshop

[10/22/23, 8:12:39 PM] Val Lapidus: Agri. Why did the I change to an o?
[10/22/23, 8:16:36 PM] Val Lapidus: Got some feedback tonight on the cacao from family friends:

Make the cacao in milk (not water)
Try adding allspice cinnamon and cayane

[10/23/23, 8:21:30 AM] Suheil - Europe: video tutorial for what exactly ? how to opoen and verify account on binance ?
[10/23/23, 8:24:20 AM] Gary Teh: You will be surprised

Lots of people have no clue and most especially how to link their binance to their bank account

You are the 1% outlier

Also not all exchanges have fiat off-ramp (cash out $$$) in Brazil ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/23, 8:25:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: no i am just asking i am not analysis or pre - imagining . yes ok i am with you 100 % on that. if the point is to guide others to do it. 

but my deeper question, is why you will need it for others to make it and who are the others that will need to open binance account ? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/23, 8:27:48 AM] Suheil - Europe: i think it would be simpler if we take care of this part and manage the USDT flow until cashing it out to concerned stakeholders bank account
[10/23/23, 8:28:08 AM] Gary Teh: The folks who will need yo figure out how to open an account in the near future. 

@557391090002, @557191035605 @5511982667030
[10/23/23, 8:28:51 AM] Gary Teh: Ok dude. Go ahead and create the video tutorial till the point of cashing out the USDt to a Brazilian bank account and then verifying the money is in the Brazilian bank account 🙂🙏
[10/23/23, 8:29:56 AM] Suheil - Europe: i didnt propose to create the video . i propose to open truesight dao braziilian verified account and manage the fiat payouts to concerned party?
[10/23/23, 8:30:31 AM] Gary Teh: He is creating the tutorial for that too 🤣
[10/23/23, 8:30:41 AM] Suheil - Europe: where the fiiat needs to fall down end of the road, the cooperative right?
[10/23/23, 8:31:08 AM] Suheil - Europe: again, i am not discussing anything about making a video, i am discussing about managing truesights dao own binance account
[10/23/23, 8:31:50 AM] Suheil - Europe: unless you want to ask others “ yo guyz go open binance and we will send u there and theen u are responsiible about “fiating it “ to your own personal bank accoount… i get it right? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/23, 8:33:38 AM] Suheil - Europe: if we are talking about videos, binance invested in proo production already and iits all there e.g —> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23z1xlD-9YY
[10/23/23, 8:33:41 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective in the future @557191035605 @557391090002 and @5511982667030 should be able to just learn to deal with the USDT off ramp when they cash out their governance tokens
[10/23/23, 8:34:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: yaaa but not by pushing them to rely on binance and i hope we will never have Truesight tokens on centralized platforms such as binance 😛
[10/23/23, 8:34:44 AM] Anupa/diya: I feel it would great if there is an financial education to it  . From opening the account to managing it which most people don't.
[10/23/23, 8:34:59 AM] Suheil - Europe: if ur asking my personal opinion 🤷
[10/23/23, 8:35:39 AM] Anupa/diya: I think that's a separate question which we will need to ask the DAO for sure. It's important to equip members before that when they are going to make that decision
[10/23/23, 8:35:45 AM] Gary Teh: Enlighten me. What is wrong with Binance? 🤔
[10/23/23, 8:37:21 AM] Suheil - Europe: nthn personal against binance. just personal against centralized entities , maybe its “noot my fault” that i grew up with psyc problems from centralized entity i think they should create new medical analysis for such problems 😛 hhhhh
[10/23/23, 8:37:43 AM] Anupa/diya: Whatever we use, the dao members need to do their own individual research before we go ahead. We should push people to research 🤣🤣
[10/23/23, 8:38:36 AM] Gary Teh: How do you propose to off ramp crypto to UsDT to your personal bank account without one of these official off-ramps? 

The private (black market) off-ramps charge a lot
[10/23/23, 8:38:42 AM] Suheil - Europe: other than they are surpassiing a strong legal storm at the exact moment
[10/23/23, 8:40:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: remember how i started my discussion about this topic (which i startted it in beer hall) about expressing my hopeless voice of agreeing that for now it is a solution for boostrap / temporary

[10/23/23, 8:41:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It will be useful for many.
[10/23/23, 8:41:27 AM] Suheil - Europe: u llost me when u jumped from topic of : need of liquidity in brazil for fiat to cover cacaoo shipment too —> members liquiditinig theiir governance token….. foor me 2 different topics to discuss 😛
[10/23/23, 8:41:45 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 and @918017107841 now is your opportunity to help 🤩
[10/23/23, 8:41:48 AM] Suheil - Europe: agaaiin guyz the toopic iis not the video tutorial hhh
[10/23/23, 8:42:05 AM] Suheil - Europe: help in what part exactly
[10/23/23, 8:44:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I know it wasn't but yet is a good idea.
[10/23/23, 8:45:22 AM] Anupa/diya: I agree ! This is an important conversation which we need to have. Decision making is a very important part of a DAO
[10/23/23, 8:45:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. What is the idea 2. The idea source / facts 3. Who need to do it 4. When 5. What we need to have in order to do it (research, people?)
[10/23/23, 8:45:42 AM] Anupa/diya: Members should know right to make that decision
[10/23/23, 8:45:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @31641075825 try to use this model
[10/23/23, 8:46:05 AM] Anupa/diya: Emelin ! I think we can maybe prototype with you
[10/23/23, 8:46:08 AM] Anupa/diya: ?
[10/23/23, 8:46:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: to explain your idea
[10/23/23, 8:46:30 AM] Anupa/diya: About onboarding about web 3 and more ?
[10/23/23, 8:46:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, as long as I can get minimum knowledge and finish what I have to.
[10/23/23, 8:46:40 AM] Anupa/diya: @31641075825 what do you think
[10/23/23, 8:46:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Any news about the events schedule so I can add to the site?
[10/23/23, 8:47:01 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I couldn't touch it because of my work but I intend to do it and add the event as soon as I can
[10/23/23, 8:47:06 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I need a list for that.
[10/23/23, 8:47:17 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @918017107841  ❤️
[10/23/23, 8:47:35 AM] Anupa/diya: Exactly.  I feel more that the minimum knowledge, it's the right knowledge
[10/23/23, 8:48:15 AM] Anupa/diya: The template is already made. I am on leave till Sunday. I can just you to the Google doc
[10/23/23, 8:48:52 AM] Anupa/diya: You can start the layout for a template and add in the information. If and when.  Didn't I send it to you. Can you please send me your email address
[10/23/23, 8:48:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: This is how I like to work. 1. We gather knowledge, talk straight ahead. 2. We break in parts so it can be understood as a process or step by step. 3. We check if it looks simple. 4. If doesn't looks simple we make it simple.
[10/23/23, 8:49:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Maybe it is because I have it hard to understand when keywords are not used.
[10/23/23, 8:50:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I understand the word through keywords. Every word contains a lot of different meanings and until we get to sort in which contexts they are being used, communication is lost.
[10/23/23, 8:50:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Actually it gave me an idea 🤔

I actually wonder how they created their shopfront
[10/25/23, 1:33:51 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes we should
[10/25/23, 1:35:19 AM] Suheil - Europe: i saw the possibility iin their back office. we can do that once we have multiple products…yet meanwhile i prefer to risk on building direct front….
[10/25/23, 12:00:37 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I understand that you and Kevin will be working on the brochure that we will be circulating to the retailers / franchisers we will be reaching out to.

I will just go ahead and compile a contact list of the small shop retailers we should be reaching out to here in the Bay Area
[10/25/23, 12:01:30 PM] Anupa/diya: Is there a buyers wholesale brochure

This was a "late" sample.

We should make it better by being "fresh" : 
- before you attending events we announce  --> during event u live or story

[10/26/23, 7:58:49 PM] Suheil - Europe: Will not lie that our work (with @972543523823 ) due to actual estate is still not coming from the heart 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[10/26/23, 7:59:15 PM] Suheil - Europe: I know we can do better but maaaan situation so fucked lol
[10/26/23, 7:59:19 PM] Suheil - Europe: Sorry for my language
[10/26/23, 7:59:24 PM] Suheil - Europe: But no other way to express
[10/26/23, 8:00:30 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Things that might help: use our own brand illustration as possible, avoid using dynamic texts too much, texts must come aligned to the left and give some space between the Insta name and the pictures/videos.
[10/26/23, 8:00:32 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I understand
[10/26/23, 8:01:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I worked the whole day doing social media and these small tips really become mechanic.

[10/26/23, 8:01:31 PM] Emelin - Bahia: you can align to the center as well when it matches the proposal.
[10/26/23, 8:01:50 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I forgot to add. I will add, hold on a sec
[10/26/23, 8:02:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Things that might help: use our own brand illustration as possible, avoid using dynamic texts too much, texts must come aligned to the left or centered, and give some space between the Insta name and the pictures/videos.
[10/26/23, 8:02:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Now, copy and paste on the notepad. I can do a checklist if you want as well.
[10/26/23, 8:03:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: it is easier to create things when we have some rules defined. Less time thinking :D more time to rest.

[10/26/23, 8:18:17 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I haven't been able to add the previous events because I've swamped. For this, I say sorry and compromise to post them weekly. If an event pops, just send me guys.
[10/26/23, 8:23:44 PM] Gary Teh: Let me take a look in the morning 🙂🙏
[10/26/23, 8:25:29 PM] Gary Teh: Tickets are not necessary 

They just created the event for marketing purposes
[10/26/23, 8:26:51 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is something that comes with Wix
[10/26/23, 8:32:58 PM] Gary Teh: They just published it on their meetup.com profile

Nothing much we need to do on our end

We are just riding on their marketing efforts by presenting our CTA at their events ‎<This message was edited>
[10/26/23, 8:33:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I added the Halloween event on the page, added the Instagram adress in two sections (still think we need to rethink the experience with the tracking your package and share with us your story - because it requires some attention of a social media schedule to show people how to do it and why to do it (a 3 posts slide would work) and sent Suheil two templates that can help with the posting, reminding to use our own identity. The time was 23:20 to 00:29.
[10/26/23, 8:33:26 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I saw it.
[10/26/23, 8:33:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanls
[10/26/23, 8:33:29 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanks

[10/26/23, 8:36:48 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Have a nice night/day you all.
[10/26/23, 8:38:08 PM] Gary Teh: That is wonderful!

Will follow up with @16468233438 when I meet him tomorrow to get more details about the night market

Also we are going to be partnering up with Edge and Node for their anniversary celebration event on the 9th of Nov
[10/26/23, 8:39:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Obs: we should have a section with pictures from the events that redirects to the Instagram as well. As it is done in the shop part. Any opportunity we can use to make people curious about Agroverse, we should use.
[10/26/23, 8:39:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I wrote some "what I get in return if I go to your event?"
[10/26/23, 8:42:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: "You will taste our fine cocoa drink and benefit your diet by having the opportunity to talk to our collaborators and learn more about the world of cocoa."
[10/26/23, 8:43:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: so if people come asking :) ...You know.
[10/26/23, 8:43:19 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This should follow as well to social media.
[10/26/23, 8:43:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Always tell the benefits of being there and not saying "you can taste". Just "you will taste"
[10/26/23, 8:44:04 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok, now going to sleep
[10/26/23, 8:45:53 PM] Val Lapidus: As far as I know no tickets necessary
[10/26/23, 8:47:55 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is a wix thing. If it is paid or free they generate a ticket but there says it is free just right away, I added to the title. I will look again tomorrow how to drift this feature they have. They generate a ticket even if it is free.
[10/26/23, 8:48:02 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will go further tomorrow.
[10/26/23, 8:48:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Thaaaaaaaanks Val

[10/26/23, 8:55:45 PM] Val Lapidus: How many new followers did we get today?
[10/26/23, 9:00:26 PM] Val Lapidus: Our event was great everyone loved the hot chocolate and our CTA felt like it resonated.  I covered three major points in my convos:
1.  Cabruca farming
2. 36% vs 6%
3.  Blockchain to document supply chain

And closed with give us a follow on insta

We met a reporter Rachel Wolfson who reports on web 3 projects and hopefully we can nurture that relationship.
[10/26/23, 9:28:04 PM] Val Lapidus: Spent 1.5 hours just now. Cleaning up after our cacao making exercise
[10/26/23, 10:03:32 PM] Gary Teh: Me and @16468233438 spent 4 hours from 3pm to 7pm just now doing the event at Edge and Node 

*Time taken: 4 hours*
[10/27/23, 5:02:34 AM] Suheil - Europe: + 13

[10/27/23, 9:05:31 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 perfect idea!
[10/27/23, 9:34:39 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm about to send this to designer for a menu mockup:  please provide feedback if you have some: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OT7Gn1k1GvPIpb4vUlC1CRtiygxvXpP6Nuznc2oSHsk/edit
[10/27/23, 9:53:57 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What designer are you hiring? I have a recommendation of someone from here.
[10/27/23, 9:54:36 AM] Val Lapidus: i have a personal friend that does all the work for me
[10/27/23, 9:54:59 AM] Val Lapidus: he is a contributor to the DAO
[10/27/23, 9:55:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Ok. In case he can't help, I have someone close to me as well.
[10/27/23, 9:55:16 AM] Val Lapidus: ty!
[10/27/23, 10:11:52 AM] Gary Teh: Perhaps a profit share model with each event organizer.
[10/27/23, 10:12:23 AM] Val Lapidus: No profit share these types of events. Usually just have a flat fee
[10/27/23, 10:12:35 AM] Val Lapidus: We don't want to profit share profit. Sharing is a worst case scenario for us
[10/27/23, 10:20:55 AM] Anupa/diya: Can't we use psd  mockups
[10/27/23, 10:21:24 AM] Gary Teh: Whatever drives conversion and 💵💶💷💴💴💸🤑 🤩🙏

*Flat fee*
DAO bears the risk of both inventory and storefront 

*Profit share* 
risk shared between event organizer and DAO. 


*Profit share*
Seems more scalable since the only risk DAO bears is inventory risk which we are bearing at cost

Incentives are aligned

Otherwise event organizers organize a shitty event and DAO paid for shitty event ‎<This message was edited>
[10/27/23, 10:21:26 AM] Val Lapidus: I'm not sure what you're asking
[10/27/23, 10:21:37 AM] Val Lapidus: The designer will create a PSD mocca
[10/27/23, 10:21:42 AM] Val Lapidus: Mock up
[10/27/23, 10:24:18 AM] Anupa/diya: OR canva
[10/27/23, 10:24:35 AM] Anupa/diya: You get them free
[10/27/23, 10:24:40 AM] Anupa/diya: You just add the text
[10/27/23, 10:26:40 AM] Val Lapidus: We can figure out if an event is worthwhile by looking at it The risk you're describing I don't think is valid
‎[10/27/23, 10:29:53 AM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/27/23, 10:34:11 AM] Val Lapidus: We should be targeting events that have decent venues that guarantee a certain number of attendees. I think there are ways to mitigate this risk by doing research on the event seeing past event participation, talking to vendors who were at the event previously, things like that can certainly mitigate the risk
[10/27/23, 10:34:41 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s define an *event selection protocol* 🤩

This can then be adopted into DAO standard operating procedure and ease scaling later on

Especially for inexperienced members attempting the same in new cities ‎<This message was edited>

[10/28/23, 11:46:02 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 this question came up last night about cabruca method 

How do we ensure we do not overpopulate the undergrowth of the canopy with so much cacao trees it crowds out other species and decreases biodiversity?

Can you help provide answer?

I am sure this question will come up again when we present in crowd who are knowledgeable about environment and sustainability 

Thank you 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/28/23, 8:57:34 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: As it is a shade-tolerant plant, it grows well in understories and thin forests, making it an extremely conservationist crop for soil, fauna and flora. Little mechanized, it is a culture that provides a high degree of employment generation. It found in the south of Bahia one of the best soils and climate for its expansion.

The State of Bahia is the largest producer in Brazil, but its production capacity was reduced by up to 60% with the advent of witches' broom, caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, currently Moniliophthora perniciosa.

The cocoa production system in Bahia is known as cabruca, an agroforestry system, where the fruit is grown under trees in the Atlantic Forest, having great importance for the preservation of the forest.
[10/28/23, 8:59:34 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: What does "lead content" means?
[10/28/23, 9:04:41 PM] Val Lapidus: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead

Lead content is harmful to humans in large quantities and people often are concerned about lead within their food
[10/28/23, 9:07:12 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Oh! I see. I belive there isn't but I'll ask to be sure.

[10/29/23, 9:22:26 PM] Gary Teh: there's this huge ass report for decreasing lead & cadmium in cocoa:  https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59a706d4f5e2319b70240ef9/t/62fd592790137e31288a1698/1660770607858/AsYouSow_ChocolateFullReport_FIN_20220817.pdf
[10/29/23, 9:22:26 PM] Gary Teh: starting around page 149 it lists strategies to reduce lead in cocoa
[10/29/23, 9:22:34 PM] Gary Teh: From @16203326626
[10/29/23, 9:24:00 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002  could you check through the document that @16203326626 shared to see how we can further lower lead content within cacao nibs imported for future shipments 

Current level is still 10X of FDA recommendations
[10/29/23, 9:26:16 PM] Gary Teh: there's also this blog post that has a rough summary of that huge report:  https://www.asyousow.org/blog/2022/8/17/new-report-explains-simple-safe-and-low-cost-solutions-to-reduce-levels-of-lead-and-cadmium-in-chocolate
[10/29/23, 9:27:21 PM] Gary Teh: cocoa nibs that are sold above the fda threshold are required to put a proposition 65 sticker if it's being sold in california
[10/29/23, 9:27:59 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok hold on.  Do our competitors have this issue?
[10/29/23, 9:28:24 PM] Val Lapidus: Like is this cacao nibs from Brazil or all chocolate?
[10/29/23, 9:28:45 PM] Dean Mao: if you buy your competitors (like navitas) they have a proposition 65 sticker on their packaging
[10/29/23, 9:29:54 PM] Dean Mao: but I think some of their packaging does not have this sticker because some nibs that were grown in peru had less lead content and fell under the threshold where a sticker is needed
[10/29/23, 9:32:33 PM] Dean Mao: but yeah this is a big problem that only recently got lots of news coverage:  https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/a-third-of-chocolate-products-are-high-in-heavy-metals-a4844566398/
‎[10/29/23, 9:33:42 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/29/23, 9:33:47 PM] Dean Mao: lots of cocoa related products have a lead & cadmium problem.  The farmers growing the product aren't really that aware and don't have any mitigation strategies.  The big companies just buy the cocoa based on price
[10/29/23, 9:34:19 PM] Dean Mao: it's a known problem that only recently got coverage.  that huge pdf that gary posted was a study done in 2022
[10/29/23, 9:34:40 PM] Gary Teh: Tess did mentioned it earlier in the year
[10/29/23, 9:37:47 PM] Dean Mao: supposedly all of the lead comes from post-processing -- meaning the bean is lead free when it's pulled from the tree.
‎[10/29/23, 9:52:17 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/29/23, 10:06:38 PM] Val Lapidus: Someone help me understand.  Are the levels in our nibs the same higher or lower than other companies?
[10/29/23, 10:08:28 PM] Dean Mao: the lead is 500 ppb, cadmium 300 ppb
‎[10/29/23, 10:10:29 PM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/29/23, 10:11:13 PM] Dean Mao: but at least we are lower than indonesia or trinidad
‎[10/29/23, 10:12:04 PM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/29/23, 10:12:30 PM] Dean Mao: but lead is easier to fix because it's a post processing mistake and not a soil problem
[10/29/23, 10:14:43 PM] Dean Mao: but also maybe get your sample sent to a lab with more detailed data, and maybe send several samples
[10/29/23, 10:16:17 PM] Dean Mao: can also send the samples to labs in the USA too, so to get a second opinion
[10/29/23, 10:16:38 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 could you help check which facility was this report generated for?

Was it for Mailan’s facility or someone else’s facility? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/29/23, 10:19:17 PM] Gary Teh: There are a few facilities in their network let’s wait for @557391090002 to respond 

He is probably asleep now
‎[10/29/23, 10:22:14 PM] Dean Mao: ‎image omitted
[10/29/23, 10:25:19 PM] Gary Teh: Also the report was a sample copy sent by Orlantildes 

I doubt it’s for Mailan’s facility 

What I am aware is that there are three processing facilities for roasting, cracking and winnowing 

Each farmer has their own fermentation and drying facility 

There are more than 600 plus farmers in the network. 

Seems like a great use case for using blockchain to track the supply chain network 

That way when a report is issued and the lead and cadmium is above threshold we will know which facility in the network is faulty and needs rectification
[10/29/23, 10:53:31 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 

Also help check if the report was for the cacao blend generated from the four farms we are sourcing from or other farms that is part of the cooperative
[10/29/23, 10:54:40 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 if there have been prior reports generated for cacaos processed at Mailan’s facility could you share them too? 

The most recent three reports will help us with our auditing process
[10/30/23, 12:33:13 AM] Gary Teh: 30 minutes FaceTime with @5511982667030 yesterday evening 

*Topics discussed*
    - marketing channels prioritization 
    - product configuration overextension concerns

@16468233438 I have told @5511982667030 to communicate directly with you regarding product configuration overextension concerns since you have volunteered to be in charge of that part

Please follow up directly with her and then exercise your own autonomy ‎<This message was edited>

We haven’t heard anything from @557391090002 regarding the *failed lead content level report* we received yesterday

The rest of it should go to DAO

If this model works, I don’t think you or me should be devoting time to operate this aspects of our go to market model on a recurring basis but hire some minimal wage workers to do so ‎<This message was edited>

We will document and run a number of market days (more than 5 less than 10) and detail cost/profit, and bring the franchise element to it, at which point franchisers can manage it however they want.  but I'm not going to give 1.5K worth of equipment to a hobo and tell them to run it for us.

what are the disadvantages to using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product
ChatGPT
Using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product can raise ethical and practical concerns. Here are some of the disadvantages:

Exploitation: It can be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals for commercial gain. Homeless people may be desperate for money and may agree to participate in marketing campaigns under coercive or exploitative conditions.

Stigmatization: Involving homeless individuals in marketing and sales may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas associated with homelessness, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of this group.

Dignity and Privacy: It may compromise the dignity and privacy of homeless people. Marketing and sales activities often involve public exposure, which can infringe on their personal space and comfort.

Unintended Consequences: Using homeless people in marketing may draw negative attention or backlash, leading to unintended consequences for both the brand and the individuals involved.

Ethical Concerns: Ethical questions can arise about whether the compensation and support provided to homeless participants are fair and adequate. This includes concerns about fair wages, working conditions, and access to healthcare and social services.

Short-Term Solution: Using homeless individuals in marketing and sales does not address the root causes of homelessness, which are primarily related to housing, employment, mental health, and social safety nets. It may be seen as a short-term, superficial solution to a complex social issue.

Dependence on Exploitation: Relying on homeless people for marketing and sales may perpetuate a system where vulnerable individuals become dependent on such opportunities instead of receiving appropriate support and assistance.

Risk to Brand Reputation: Associating a brand with the use of homeless people in marketing can lead to backlash, harm brand reputation, and result in boycotts or negative public sentiment.

Legal and Regulatory Concerns: There may be legal and regulatory challenges, such as ensuring that all participants are adults who have provided informed consent. Employing homeless individuals without addressing labor and employment laws could lead to legal issues.

Lack of Expertise: Homeless individuals may not have the necessary expertise or training for marketing and sales roles, potentially affecting the effectiveness of the campaign and customer experience.

It is important for businesses and organizations to consider these disadvantages carefully and explore alternative ways to support homeless individuals that are more ethical and sustainable. These may include partnering with charities and organizations, providing job training and housing assistance, or actively participating in efforts to address homelessness in their communities.
[10/30/23, 10:58:51 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 that's not to say I am against hiring of homeless.  On the contrary, I'd be happy to hire them for package and back of house activities, and am happy to pay them more than minimum wage.
[10/30/23, 10:59:53 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you use homeless in your marketing/sales you will jeopardize our brand and our marketing efforts for franchising
[10/30/23, 11:01:07 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 if you are going to conduct experiments with homeless in sales/marketing than please do so using a different brand other than Agroverse, and only once the efforts are deemed successful you can attempt your experiments on Agroverse.
[10/30/23, 11:01:35 AM] Gary Teh: Dan runs a social program that is rehabilitating the homeless. Those are looking for jobs.

Those folks in the photos are not homeless they are peddlers
[10/30/23, 11:06:53 AM] Gary Teh: technically they are no longer homeless as they are being housed by Dan's facility right now
[10/30/23, 11:10:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: If there is a facility there are some data about why these guys ended up on the streets and if they have been clear on anything they used (if they used), right?
[10/30/23, 11:10:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: *joins the discussion because it seems interesting*
[10/30/23, 11:11:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Many uber drivers in Brazil have a graduation. I've met lawyers, teachers, accountants, but when things got hard here, they had to find a way out.
[10/30/23, 11:12:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We don't have financial education at schools so facing a hard time with no one to help, it is easy to loose everything.
[10/30/23, 11:13:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Val seems reasonable, Gary as well. These people may have a gap on their job because of the time they were without a job.
[10/30/23, 11:13:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Two people seems just a few, but you might compromise with something bigger than you guys think.
[10/30/23, 11:14:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So it is smart to join the will of helping others with a strategy that protects Agroverse.
[10/30/23, 11:14:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: maybe start with one person and see how it goes.
[10/30/23, 11:15:11 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Second person you guys would have more experience about what can go sideways and yet, would not put that much of time, something you don't have right now.
[10/30/23, 11:15:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: *leaves the room shaking hands*
[10/30/23, 12:57:36 PM] Val Lapidus: @557391090002 is there any way for us to pay Orlantildes where in we don't have a huge taxation event?
[10/30/23, 12:58:52 PM] Val Lapidus: it seems like the cost of doing business with Brazil has high amounts of taxes and we need to find away to mitigate these costs.
[10/30/23, 1:03:43 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Orlantildes said that he will ask the company who provide the information about the lead to confirm the data we have
[10/30/23, 1:40:27 PM] Gary Teh: Spent time with @16468233438 just now loaded our inventory into the warehouse in proper

*Time taken: 3 hours*
[10/30/23, 2:02:16 PM] Val Lapidus: just spoke to Kevin he mentioned a chocolate shop in Wauwatosa WI that makes high end chocolate and I called them to see if they would be interested in sampling. I spoke to Dan the owner, we need to get them a sample of #9: 
7515 Harwood Ave.
Wauwatosa, WI 53213
and we need to get them an email of some questions.
@557391090002 for the blend that we are doing, how did we decide on those four farms.  Are we able to source from a single farm?  Do you have a website for the Cacao institute that will be doing the testing of our nibs?  
Also can you give me all the details regarding the roasting/fermentation process for this blend we are getting?

Don’t try to centralize things too much when there is no critical need for that

Otherwise it stops being DAO ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/23, 8:48:57 PM] Anupa/diya: How is we as a collective being centralized. For the people by the people
[10/30/23, 8:50:16 PM] Gary Teh: For example @5511982667030 has her ideas about how the products should just be about cacao nibs 

Since @16468233438 is doing the execution it’s his call how he wants to modify the products to become drinks instead 

While @16468233438 was busy I was messing around with the recipe. Since it was my execution, while @16468233438  has his opinion, since I was doing the execution, I did it my way 

I know Annia designed the T-Shirt but since @16468233438was placing the order with the printer he could decide which design he wants

But since I was paying for the shirts when I picked them up, it was my call to buy another t-shirt for the homeless whom I wanted to run a social experiment on 

All these diversity is by design ‎<This message was edited>

[10/31/23, 10:33:17 PM] Gary Teh: When I was at the Crypto Rockstar conference in Germany earlier in the year, I had the opportunity to speak to the company that Jakob hired to help line up the sponsors for him to close.

It sees there is one person in charge of building the database and another in charge of warming the lead to get to an appointment before Jakob comes in to close the sponsorship deal

It feels like a human supply chain ‎<This message was edited>
[11/1/23, 3:04:17 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Good morning guys! A had a conversation with Orlantildes yesterday night. I belive we had a misunderstanding here.  When u guys asked me about the lead on the Cocoa and I talked to Orlantildes about it he didn't notice that I was referring to your Nibs. He thought that it was about a general research that's why he sent me a test made by OFI relative a Cocoa that pass through a industrial method and it  and not a test made by CIC directed to our nibs. Nibs as u know it's about the bean dry toasted and broken and nothing more.

[11/2/23, 11:13:32 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: ‎You removed Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop
[11/2/23, 11:16:32 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 let me know if you can follow up with Christino by this Sunday otherwise based on what @5511982667030 has observed you really have too much on your plate 

So some scope needs to be unloaded. Perhaps *business development* activities since you are trying to straddle both *business development* and *operations* 

interfacing with Christino falls under *business development* scope 🙂🙏

Interfacing with Orlantildes right now falls under *operations scope* ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/23, 3:55:37 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 The next model I'd like to experiment on is one that involves direct sale to chocolate makers
[11/2/23, 3:56:53 PM] Gary Teh: Ok! Give this current model you are working on a few more iterations. If it works great! We start populating people with it and scale it. If it does not, we drop it.

Let me know what are the different steps you have in mind for this new model that self compounds. Let's update our growth engine ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/23, 6:05:27 PM] Val Lapidus: Something along the lines of :  help end nestlé drink Amazonian rainforest chocolate
[11/2/23, 6:05:43 PM] Val Lapidus: Or let's rid the world of Nestle
[11/2/23, 6:25:51 PM] Gary Teh: Test that CTA at the next event 

Can you try to shorten it to less than 7 worlds

[11/3/23, 12:57:38 AM] Anupa/diya: I thought this was fantastic! Building product fit with storytelling @31641075825 check this out. 

The girl basically created a buzz about the context and how it's used and then launched her own product.
[11/3/23, 12:58:05 AM] Anupa/diya: It might be a great way to adopt for social media and other marketing tactics
[11/3/23, 6:00:43 AM] Gary Teh: Just received invoice from Coopercabruca for the USDA NOP cacao nibs 

https://portal.omie.com.br/view/2023-11-03/f58c1bf369f3928a577c991e8521a571acfae030?a=6ezzn0f&d=0bf5av1btgqcz&t=r
[11/3/23, 6:03:47 AM] Suheil - Europe: according to my knowledge that instagram algo differentiates between high-quality posts (specifically the ones that promote sales) and personal.

Your mini-documentary is good for attracting viral audience to build up the community around the philosophy/concept . but we would be very lucky if we can hit 2 birds one stone aka also a concept soldiier and a buyer/client
[11/3/23, 6:04:20 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 you need to follow up with Orlantildes to get any reference number that Omega services might have issued Coopercabruca for the cacao shipment that is being sent to them in Salvador 

That way, when you reach out to Omega services and attempt to follow up with our cargo to understand the arrangements they have setup with SeaCoastLogistics they will know what we are talking about 

You can get @5511982667030 to support you if you need. Feel free to exercise your autonomy. Critical point is make sure this shipment does not fall through the crack anywhere in the interfacing and disappear 

*Omega services*: outbound freighting company based in Salvador 

*SeaCoast Logistic*: customs broker based in USA

PS: I am making a huge assumption that there is in fact a reference number here. Perhaps there is none. That is for you to go figure out ‎<This message was edited>
[11/3/23, 6:04:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: yees indeed and what gary is producing is kind of similar iin aanother format
[11/3/23, 6:07:00 AM] Suheil - Europe: i can’t advance the instagram under “corporate sales” push before it gets surrounded by the community concept/

as corporate sales can easily eliminate the community aspect thus showing us as just “bllablaer’s” and utilizing social as a pretext to just sell a product 🤷
[11/3/23, 6:07:43 AM] Gary Teh: We are using Instagram to sell products
[11/3/23, 6:08:43 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes but we are imitating this strategy… from ur personal story content we are infusing the product to sell .
[11/3/23, 6:08:52 AM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 go study how this Iran dude I met last night does it 

https://instagram.com/itsyouofficial?igshid=NGVhN2U2NjQ0Yg==

His clothes are selling like hot cakes
[11/3/23, 6:09:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: we focus on stories and in beetween throw product promotiion
[11/3/23, 6:11:39 AM] Gary Teh: Feel free to exercise your autonomy 

What is a good KPI (key performance index) you would like to benchmark your personal experiments against? 

Otherwise no measurements no improvements ‎<This message was edited>
[11/3/23, 6:12:07 AM] Suheil - Europe: ok quiick anallysis of what u sent:

- instagram page with fiirst post 21/02/2020 = beginning of building his instagram community

- a pure product sales page = very clear set of target client and simple  call to actiion “ come buy”
VS our caase

we are telling all stories about farmers and sustainability and change and innovation and and and then oh  please buy to support thee mission
[11/3/23, 6:14:55 AM] Gary Teh: 21/02/2020 was two years ago
[11/3/23, 6:17:09 AM] Suheil - Europe: exactly my point that iit took him that long to reach 3k which obviously they did organic and surrounded the right audience . 

As a designer you are heavily active offline which then get translated into “instagram” . I would be pretty astonished if designer tells me “ ii succeeded to generate my online ssales oonly from instagram”
[11/3/23, 6:18:24 AM] Suheil - Europe: fashion and clothing iindustry is annia’s expertise. in fact, what made anniia loose her mind with us is that she iis not understanding why we are focusing on community and not just setting up a traditional business page 🤷 
her reaction was liitteraly like : “ i dont understand what you guyz are doiing filming yourself for an instagram page to sell cacao “ hhhh
[11/3/23, 6:20:46 AM] Suheil - Europe: i understand her as she is in pure business mode of how she got used to work and buiild up online shops
[11/3/23, 6:21:52 AM] Suheil - Europe: i cant put KPI’s on building a community 
I can put KPI’s in business language and it will require budgets because i never saw in my life a business succeeding to push onliine sales under a business mode without setting up a long term execution budget for online marketing (like even if its only 100$ /month budget for 12 months doesnt matteer whats the amount but the algo needs money to push sales prooduct

it should be: conscientious
[11/3/23, 1:14:21 PM] Val Lapidus: can someone please fix this
[11/3/23, 1:15:03 PM] Val Lapidus: These two words look similar, but they are not interchangeable. You should use conscientious in terms of desire and performing deliberate actions and conscious in terms of physically being awake or simply aware of something.

I could set something up on spatial.

[11/4/23, 10:47:39 AM] Anupa/diya: I can use spatial to build a story telling and you guys can get an oculus on rent for people to experience the spatial
[11/4/23, 10:47:45 AM] Anupa/diya: Spatial is like a free metaverse
[11/4/23, 10:48:00 AM] Anupa/diya: You can use the laptop or you can use vr to access it
[11/4/23, 10:48:16 AM] Anupa/diya: We can add all the videos and footage
[11/4/23, 10:48:25 AM] Anupa/diya: Photos and set up a gallery
[11/4/23, 10:48:58 AM] Anupa/diya: You guys can play that on site while having the events with vr
[11/4/23, 10:49:14 AM] Gary Teh: That would be quite an interesting concept and aligns well with our theme of *Saving our Rainforest with Web3*
[11/4/23, 10:50:33 AM] Anupa/diya: If you guys can get a vr.. let's do it. I know last year it was huge at the web 3 events.
[11/4/23, 10:50:38 AM] Anupa/diya: And it's fun.
[11/4/23, 10:50:55 AM] Anupa/diya: Gets people curious ! At live events
[11/4/23, 11:35:16 AM] Gary Teh: Worse case scenario, we should on MacBook! 🤩
[11/4/23, 11:41:26 AM] Anupa/diya: Ya ..that's what i do. If it's on a MacBook, it's not that great for an in person. Doable

We could do a product launch event. have people on spatial .
[11/4/23, 11:44:33 AM] Gary Teh: Sounds fun. Exercise your *Autonomy* and go for it! 

Always great to have some *Diversity* in the experience we offer to folks in the community 

*Autonomy* and *Diversity* are both core values of our DAO🤩🙏

That way I can compile the performance information and have it shared in the Townhall with the rest of the governance tokens holders 

This will help serve as the baseline benchmark for our next iteration

[11/4/23, 11:00:54 PM] Anupa/diya: I spotted a few people have the same issue but there is a lock on the comments. I have added one for us . I dont think we should shut amazon because the end to end delivery service is full proof.
[11/4/23, 11:47:18 PM] Gary Teh: Would you like to follow up and deal with the issue now that you have access to Amazon sellers account as well

@16468233438 until now has not logged into the Amazon account yet

The only folks who have done so thus far are you (@918017107841 ), myself and @31641075825 

I am thinking since @31641075825 and Annia are working on Instagram, perhaps you should oversee Amazon

That way @557191035605 can oversee Wix

Which leaves @16468233438 to just focus on the farmer's market, events sponsorship and fulfilment stuff

I am streamlining the load on @16468233438 plate now as I did yours last month ‎<This message was edited>

[11/5/23, 1:45:29 AM] Gary Teh: Could you help source for one? 🙂🙏
[11/5/23, 1:46:46 AM] Anupa/diya: I have no idea about sales ! I am service design😆 do we have any sales and marketing ?

[11/6/23, 12:28:55 PM] Val Lapidus: When we go to events or talk about our product. There are three key talking points, none of those talking points are on the website, and they are the most interesting aspect of this project.  I'd like to work on getting those points into the main site.  The three talking points are:

6% versus 36% to farmers
Cabruca farming method
Supply chain on the blockchain

[11/6/23, 1:53:24 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 ☝️does this mean that the DAO doesn’t want to participate in the farmers market?
[11/6/23, 1:54:49 PM] Gary Teh: If it’s selling hot choclate, you are correct

the bulk of the consensus is the guild just wants to stick to nibs 

Any processing beyond the nibs stage, it is independent of the dao 

The exception would be it is a product that was created in its final form on the farmer’s end and past through DAO network for distribution in USA

The model becomes cleaner in this regard

Rather than becoming a manufacturer we stick to being a distributor 

Otherwise a lot of the value captured along the supply chain needs to stay with us to pay for all these transformation expenses instead of passing directly to the farmers and the cooperatives where they should be ‎<This message was edited>

[11/6/23, 2:12:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Cabruca farming method is explained in the shop, after realizing it is also an important place to have it, as some will go straight to see the product. The idea was to create a page with cabruca method explained again in case of more curious users to be inclined to search for a about us as a page itself
[11/6/23, 2:13:10 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We got some content removed after talking with Gary
[11/6/23, 2:13:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: On the whitepaper
[11/6/23, 2:13:29 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So we need to see what comes in.
[11/6/23, 2:14:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: You can highlight on whitepaper itself and I can work on it on saturday.
[11/6/23, 2:48:37 PM] Gary Teh: Also an insight that became apparent about our DAO after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

I feel we should play to our strengths instead of our weakness

From this perspective, manufacturing is not going to be our strength. Instead distribution is. 

We are not leveraging enough of our strength in distribution and kind of got alittl distracted in the manufacturing side of things ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/23, 3:58:19 PM] Val Lapidus: I don't necessarily agree with any of that.  But at the same time the only difference for me is that I can no longer tokenize the elements required to execute on the path that I'm currently on. I have full autonomy to execute whatever I want to. But now the guild will simply not share in the profit. If I happen to generate one instead, they will only see the benefit of me purchasing the nibs and potentially me reselling the nibs ‎<This message was edited>

About the money we owe to them, pls, check with Gary what is right amount. He is following the transaction more closely.

[11/6/23, 7:15:54 PM] Anupa/diya: I think the events is a great idea. The retail bussiness is huge and it is a great source for marketing. However There is a huge initial expense involved and more than that it is a lot of work. 

In India there is a huge percentage of small to large  scale entrepreneurs who just sell via markets bazaars to large expos. They extremely well during the holiday seasons. I had seen in London, during the Christmas markets, mulled wine and hot chocolate were high selling drinks 

The Charlie and chocolate factory is releasing maybe some sort of buzz can happen around the Golden ticket 

@16468233438 you can create your own brand called Val's chocolate drink. That can be sub brand for agroverse
[11/6/23, 7:47:10 PM] Anupa/diya: *ATTENTION* I am creating a team section on the tru sight for agroverse. Please dm me your name, any photo that shows this is you and your role

[11/6/23, 7:52:58 PM] Anupa/diya: @557191035605 do you know where all the event videos and photos are
[11/6/23, 10:00:55 PM] Gary Teh: Or perhaps even an independent brand
[11/6/23, 10:01:12 PM] Gary Teh: There is no such group
[11/6/23, 10:10:22 PM] Gary Teh: When I think of a DAO and I think of a highly structured labor intensive operation, I just don’t see how these two models can resolve and if it does how. does it sustain itself. House of Balance has been trying to utilize this model to hold large scale events every year. The model doesn’t really facilitate that

When I think even more deeply of the organic behavior exhibited by DAO members over the past two years, I feel  it more readily lends itself to such kind of casual informal impromptu structures

Seems like an ultra long list. 🤯

Might take a while to create. Perhaps the rest of the week 🤣

[11/10/23, 9:56:02 AM] Gary Teh: Back last year during the prediction market project, I have already setup the initial working prototype type for our own EVM based chain 

The code can be found here 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

Didn’t bother to do any further development as that was not the critical action

The critical action was Discovering and Validating a *viable business case* for TrueSight DAO

But as a bootstrap we can have the entries notarized on Ethereum or one of the EVM compatible chains work

At some point it makes sense is to have our own chain and miners as opposed to constantly paying another tech company gas/transaction fees. 

That was what lead to the thinking of *Sunmint* off the grid data center clusters where Our miners will be housed there. 

When I was in Bahia Matheus and Marcel offered their place to run miners. 

Hence it might not even be necessary for us to own the land where SunMint operates on. We run the nodes on the property of the farmers and the gas/transaction fees are paid to them

I went short and straight with the content here. Val and I talked that before putting any information is important to know which information is gonna enter and along with what.

[11/10/23, 11:27:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: What I recommended to Val as we talked today was to be sure what he wants on the site, so a new page can be created and all this info can be together. I mention it there, but if you guys want a deeper explanation on this I need to create a page and in order to create this, all info need to be put together first.
[11/10/23, 11:27:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is the kind of info on "how it is prepared" and it deserves an "about us" section not directed to the homepage, same process as scrolling down, but to another section.
[11/10/23, 11:28:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Gather the info, decide, let me read them, group them, and then, I add to the site. :)

_Step 1_: Please review and update the benefits portion as you see fit

_benefits list has been tuned based on rounds of conversations during the In Real Life meetups/events I have been gate crashing these past 4 weeks_

_Step 2: will get @557191035605 help with brochure design that utilizes the native artwork that she created in our brand guide_

_Step 3: once packaging of the 100KG incoming import is completed and I am done with my 3 week retreat, print the brochures and hit the stores and the manufacturers along the entire west coast of USA_

_PS: @⁨Val Lapidus⁩ perhaps leave some portions of the 100KG unpackaged as my sense is some manufacturer might just want to buy in bulk_ ‎<This message was edited>
[11/11/23, 12:05:28 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 thoughts on 16th arrangement?

*Option 1: 2 pronged operations*

Based on the inputs from Orlantildes, it seems having just one person at the airport will be more than sufficient to load the 100KG on to a rented uhaul van (approximately USD41)

That way you don’t need to be rushing over to the airport and then back to deal with preparing and making available the chocolate drinks for Edge and Node anniversary event

*Option 2: delay the pickup*

Have SeaCoast Logistics pick up the cargo from the airport and then we pick it up after the event. I am sure they will be charging something for that service. Not sure if it is going to be more expensive than USD41. Also judging by the dimensions of each box, I might need to get another transport before I could load the boxes in my car anyways. 

*Follow up*
Let me know your preference by Monday. So that I have enough lead time to arrange for logistics with U-haul services. 🤩

[11/12/23, 9:49:46 AM] Gary Teh: *Question 1*
Are you sure it’s exactly 24 hours and not before clock strikes midnight of crossing from 16th to 17th of Nov?

There are some ambiguities there that needs clarification 

*Question 2*
Also SFO is a very large place. 

Which exact terminal or gate should we be heading to to pick up our cargo or are we even supposed going to be heading to the passenger terminals at all? 
Perhaps there is a specific facility we are supposed to report to to claim our cargo when we arrive for the pickup 

*Proposed follow up*
These are two questions you should want to clarify with Graziela on Monday when she is in the office. 

Let me know if you want to do the follow up instead. I only have very little lead time (Tuesday and Wednesday) to respond if _questions 1 and 2_ requires specific arrangements to be made. 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

If The vendor who wants to use him to create the product for sales at various events then the vendor 

If we want to use him to handle packaging of DAO cacao nibs then the DAO will pay.
[11/13/23, 11:14:29 AM] Val Lapidus: who is managing him?
[11/13/23, 11:15:02 AM] Gary Teh: *Management*

If the vendor wants to use him to generate product for sales at events. Then the vendor

If the DAO wants to use him for packaging then someone from the DAO getting paid 100TDG per hour

[11/13/23, 11:16:49 AM] Val Lapidus: so as a vendor, i wouldn’t put him for sales at events, he’s a cook not a seller, so that doesn’t make sense.  as for if the DAO is using him.  So now instead of a DAO member working and producing at 100 TDG per hour, we are now increasing the cost.  It doesn’t make sense
[11/13/23, 11:19:01 AM] Gary Teh: He is a cook suitable for the kitchen

He is not suitable for sales 

Vendor has autonomy to do what vendor wants to. 

Just think of vendor as a separate company

DAO does not control how vendor handles things internally. 

And neither can DAO control how individual DAO member executes on things 

The only thing that DAO does is surface what can be proposed to DAO members. 

It is up to individual members to decide if he/she wants to invest personal time/resource/money in what is being proposed by DAO ‎<This message was edited>

That way on Friday morning we do not need to get bogged down by the complications of dealing with the customs and then rushing over to the kitchen ‎<This message was edited>
[11/14/23, 1:32:54 PM] Gary Teh: Analyzing the critical paths for our operations happening on 16th, the more buffer we can build into each step the less likely disruption at one step will cause disruption to another step

https://www.projectmanager.com/guides/pert-chart

When we go down this route, you will need to handle the route for Edge and Node as an independent thread

While me and Jason handle the independent thread of dealing with the customs and any complications that might arise ‎<This message was edited>
[11/14/23, 2:53:40 PM] Val Lapidus: I was thinking more along the lines of not having to load and unload multiple times.  We get it from the airport in the morning and then take it right away to the kitchen
[11/14/23, 2:56:36 PM] Gary Teh: What time is the kitche scheduled?
[11/14/23, 3:03:02 PM] Val Lapidus: We can go whenever we want

[11/14/23, 3:04:13 PM] Val Lapidus: So Friday we can leave my house at 10 pickup at airport
[11/14/23, 3:04:34 PM] Val Lapidus: And head straight to kitchen.  Package and be done
[11/14/23, 3:04:57 PM] Gary Teh: Perfect! 🤩

He lives in San mateo 

It doesn’t make sense for him to drive to San Francisco and then drive back to the airport 

When I look at the size of boxes I doubt it is going to fit 2 cars

[11/15/23, 11:58:34 AM] Gary Teh: Ok. Worst case scenario if we can’t do it all in one shot at least someone to stand guard over our cargo while the rest are doing the transporting 🤣

My assumption is once we unload the cargo from the warehouse the airport staff don’t want us going in an out anymore

[11/15/23, 3:12:14 PM] Gary Teh: Cost price is too expensive.
[11/15/23, 3:12:14 PM] Val Lapidus: This is not a good use of resources

Before I left Brazil, I left one of my credit cards with @5511982667030 

If required in the future, @5511982667030 can withdraw money from that card and then transfer it to Coopercabruca via Pix

[11/17/23, 6:34:28 PM] Gary Teh: *Spent 30 minutes* FaceTime with @5511982667030 clearing up the confusion

@5511982667030 has my Wells Fargo credit card 

@5511982667030 also has R$500 under her management 

For expected payments these three weeks, She can pay from the R$500 under management

If expenses goes beyond R$500 that she has with her right now, she can withdraw money using my credit card at one of their local banks’ ATM 

This way is much cheaper to pay for smaller amounts of expenses incurred in Brazil (less than USD1000) than paying via International Wire transfer

*This is just an interim solution*

I am not expecting any large payments to Brazil side till end of the year. 

If need does arise that we pay for items above USD1000 before year end, it is recommended we do wireless transfer via USA bank 

In the future, beyond the end of this year, if our sales and marketing efforts in USA and Europe is successful and we believe there is a foreseeable need to make constant payments to Brazil suppliers, I will personally fly into Brazil and setup for a dedicated digital bank account and hook it up with PIX.

that way we can make future payments to suppliers in Brazil directly via PIX. Via this route we will not have to incur international bank transfer cost ‎<This message was edited>

As discussed and agreed upon, inviting you out of our guild 

@16468233438 will be the primary interface between Brazil and USA moving forward

https://www.dollartree.com/peel-seal-kraft-paper-envelopes-5-ct/361746



*_Key constrains*_
When combined with shipping labels from stamps.com, total shipping and material cost will be under *_USD6.50*_ which is what we are currently charging for shipping within USA. 

To stay under this cost each package shipped out must be under *_9 ounce*_ to stick to that shipping price 

Also packaging and mailer materials *must not contain plastic* otherwise our brand story of saving the rainforest totally falls apart, which means we will need to totally scrape the story that we are saving the rainforest and tell a totally different brand story for Agroverse. Right now I don’t even know what other compelling story to tell other than this one. 



*Worst case scenario analysis*
if our brand story doesn’t work and nothing sells, we will just donate our entire inventory to GoodWill during *Christmas 2024* and scrape the project. Since expiry date is within a year, we can’t sell it beyond *17th 2024* 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

[11/24/23, 12:55:33 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Thanks @31641075825, its a great start to grasp the generalities, we need more information about the actual product and the cabruca method, our collaboration with the cooperative and a slide on truesight. We need to showcase the social and env impact while exhibiting our product: characteristics, packaging, etc…
[11/24/23, 5:37:48 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=241235

Write up by US government on the cabruca system and challenge farmers face due to low income/hectare.

increasing number of these land turning into pasture land (or chop down trees and grow soy beans) when farmers give up thereby adding to global warming ‎<This message was edited>
[11/24/23, 5:38:40 PM] Gary Teh: https://www.truesight.me/agroverse

There is the link to the white paper on this page which talks about how our model aims to help the farmers using the cabruca method

This is achieved through reconfiguration of supply chain so they get paid 34% instead of the original 6% from the revenue proceeds of choclate sale ‎<This message was edited>

[11/28/23, 12:36:13 PM] Gary Teh: Seems this _article_ as well as our _bag of cacao nibs_ sitting at the kitchen counter came in really handy for storytelling purposes 

Today is the off day for the entire community at the zen center

Randomly bumped into the manager in charge of procuring all the food supplies for the zen kitchen

She gave me an in-depth dive of the _user psychology_ when it comes to stocking their kitchen and how their supply chain works.

She loved the *_story of saving the rainforest*_  as well as the *_earthy design of the package*_ so much, she has offered to help setup an appointment with the *_procurement manager*_ of their Whole Foods supplier. Once we establish a relationship with the _*procurement manager_*, the hope is that they will start buying our cacao nibs in bulk

Also she has offered to drive me over to meet the _*procurement manager*_ once the Whole Foods retailer responses

She also mentioned that the zen center is geographically situated right at the heart of where our target demographic is located 

The universe is very visibly self aligning. 🤩🙏

https://veritablevegetable.com/grower/

Something she pointed out that @41765737357 mentioned earlier in the year during our group chat together, *_the story of where the food comes*_ from is almost if not becoming even more important than the food now that *_conscious consumption*_ has became the trend 

She proposed to checkout the sample story of a farm on the link below and when we visit the store watch out for the physical marketing material collateral placed in the stores to help consumers know more about the various stories of each product

[11/29/23, 12:27:07 PM] Val Lapidus: Who is monitoring the queue of Amazon for items ordered?
[11/29/23, 4:42:21 PM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 has volunteered for that
[11/29/23, 4:43:35 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 what orders have there been?
[11/29/23, 4:44:15 PM] Val Lapidus: @918017107841 did you know that we have to mark orders as shipped on Amazon? I got an email from Amazon for the item that I purchased that because it hasn't been shipped. My credit card wasn't charged
[11/29/23, 8:00:51 PM] Anupa/diya: Hi Val
[11/29/23, 8:01:13 PM] Anupa/diya: I had no idea that things had to be marked.
[11/29/23, 8:02:07 PM] Anupa/diya: I am not looking into orders anymore. I was looking into the Amazon issue which I believe is solved. I have way too much on my plate now to look into sales.

[11/29/23, 9:08:47 PM] Gary Teh: Thanks for clarifying this. It is good to know no one is actively monitoring it. 🙂🙏
[11/29/23, 9:16:24 PM] Anupa/diya: I was under the impression that I had to the Amazon thing and I have started with spatial for agroverse so that's going to take up my time

[11/29/23, 9:24:00 PM] Gary Teh: @31641075825 what are you actively working on now within the scope of Agroverse? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/29/23, 9:25:00 PM] Gary Teh: Rodney is starting to become active within this scope.

We should free up room here in this guild for him 

One person needs to leave 🙂🙏
[11/29/23, 9:25:46 PM] Gary Teh: I am pretty happy to step away from this guild if no one offers to free up the space
[11/29/23, 10:23:14 PM] Anupa/diya: The spatial thing. The details are somewhere if one scrolls up
[11/29/23, 10:23:23 PM] Anupa/diya: And some up buyer leads
[11/30/23, 12:18:24 AM] Val Lapidus: What are the credentials for Amazon?  Where do I find the orders that were placed once I login?

[11/30/23, 4:31:25 AM] Gary Teh: You will need a one time password to login to the account that is sent to my phone when you attempt to login for the first time 

Once Amazon recognizes your computer they will stop asking it
[11/30/23, 4:31:43 AM] Gary Teh: Not sure. Check YouTube for tutorial once you login
[11/30/23, 5:13:01 AM] Anupa/diya: My work is subsidiary. I just need to be in contact with someone from agroverse to give updates from buyer leads and spatial.. my work is not daily or operational. So I can leave
[11/30/23, 5:13:36 AM] Anupa/diya: Since Rodney is more active than me. I can just pass on the details
[11/30/23, 7:53:37 AM] Rodney Wieck: ‎You added Rodney Wieck
[11/30/23, 7:55:53 AM] Gary Teh: Please welcome @19209806391 to our guild 

@19209806391’s primary role now within our guild will be to help introduce our cacao nibs to merchants in his geographical area (_Wisconsin area, USA_)

later on when we have a supply chain established to his region, oversee the warehousing facility that he right now operates

He also has warehousing facilities in Montana area 🙂🙏
[11/30/23, 7:57:32 AM] Gary Teh: @918017107841 thank you once again for your active contribution to our guild during this tenure 

Looking forward to your contribution again in the very near future. Inviting you out for now 

I expect I will be in India sometime next year. Let’s sync up in @120363041505997891@g.us on which Tradeshows in India to visit while I am there 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/30/23, 9:03:14 AM] Gary Teh: Please work closely with @16468233438 and @12245781775 

@16468233438 is based in San Francisco and where our main warehousing is and does sales outreach 

@12245781775 is based in Chicago. He mainly does cold calls
[12/1/23, 2:59:39 AM] Suheil - Europe: sorry for delay answer, i will get my focus back to here by early next week and will follow up with everything going here
[12/1/23, 5:26:02 AM] Vlatko Gigov: hey Team. hope all is well. I have received the nibs already and have a meeting on Monday. we need to have this presentation ready by then.
[12/1/23, 5:28:14 AM] Vlatko Gigov: the focus on the presentation needs to be on the 1. product, 2. sustainability efforts, 3. supply chain tracking, 3. the farming / organic methodology, 4. production process
[12/1/23, 5:29:00 AM] Vlatko Gigov: we need to stress what are the differentiating factors from other nibs producers.
[12/1/23, 5:46:11 AM] Suheil - Europe: I will do my best to assign couple of hours during the week end to finish it . Can't promise though 😕

[12/1/23, 7:38:33 AM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 in thought Gary sent you a pack with packaging and nibs?  If you need more.  Please tell me how many packs you need, and how much nibs you need
[12/1/23, 8:02:46 AM] Vlatko Gigov: heya Val, i’ve received only 3kg directly from Brazil. I dont have the actual agroverse product. and thats what I need.
[12/1/23, 8:03:18 AM] Vlatko Gigov: i need only the packaging with labels to then fill them in with what I have.
[12/1/23, 8:05:52 AM] Gary Teh: I was going to pass @41799155602 the packaging when I arrive in Switzerland 

But if he is able to get it before I arrive then less weigh in my backpack 🙂🙏
[12/1/23, 8:08:34 AM] Vlatko Gigov: yeah that was the initial plan, but the nibs (christmas) has arrived early.
[12/1/23, 8:21:13 AM] Val Lapidus: How many packs do you need?  When do you need them?  Address?
‎[12/1/23, 3:54:55 PM] Val Lapidus: ‎image omitted
[12/1/23, 4:02:38 PM] Gary Teh: Which by service provider and package did you use for @41799155602?

There is one that just cost USD21 for worldwide for each 8 ounce bag 

Please use that one next time
[12/1/23, 4:03:54 PM] Gary Teh: Also which one did you use for @19209806391 

USPS provider should be charging maximum USd6.50 for each 8 ounce bag
[12/1/23, 4:04:26 PM] Val Lapidus: It turns out that both packages were supposed to go via UPS instead of USPS.  So I'm going to go home and figure out if there is a $21 option and canceled this 100 option
[12/1/23, 4:04:46 PM] Gary Teh: Yes please.
[12/1/23, 4:05:01 PM] Val Lapidus: Can you send me a screenshot of the configuration that you chose to get a $21 shipment

[12/1/23, 4:08:57 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438

How heavy was the package shipped to @19209806391?

Why was it USd10.xx? ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/23, 4:09:38 PM] Val Lapidus: rodney was 18 oz

[12/1/23, 4:09:51 PM] Val Lapidus: ten dollars
[12/1/23, 4:10:15 PM] Gary Teh: Please do screenshot of official receipt for both items and submit them to @120363111951279022@g.us
[12/1/23, 4:11:51 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 please report content shipped as investors need to be kept updated on the inventory levels of their investments 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/23, 4:12:49 PM] Gary Teh: If process is becoming too much of a load please let us know.

We will make modifications to the process to reduce load on your side

[12/1/23, 4:15:04 PM] Val Lapidus: i’ll cancel the 100$ one, I don’t know why it didn’t give me this option before
[12/1/23, 4:15:27 PM] Val Lapidus: the only thing different is I selected pritn on: and chose 8.5x11 paper
[12/1/23, 4:17:23 PM] Val Lapidus: ok, for some reason it didn’t give me the option to select USPS as a carrier when i tried originaly
[12/1/23, 4:18:48 PM] Val Lapidus: deleted message as it had vladko’s personal address
[12/1/23, 4:23:41 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 i’ve requested refunds for both items and am redoing the lables
[12/1/23, 8:43:09 PM] Gary Teh: What were the contents shipped to Vlatko? 

That way I can gauge what else to bring him when I arrive in Switzerland 

Also know how to update *_ledger for AGL2*_
[12/1/23, 8:43:46 PM] Val Lapidus: 8 empty 8oz labeled packs
[12/1/23, 8:47:11 PM] Gary Teh: @41799155602

Are you planning to sell these 8 bags or giving out as samples to prospective distributors?

If distributing them out to prospective distributors, then cost of cacao nibs and freighting should be deducted from *_OffChain ledger and borne by DAO*_

If planning to sell to buyers than the total cost and DAO based standard markup will be charged via *_invoice issued*_

Let me know which is which ‎<This message was edited>
[12/1/23, 8:47:36 PM] Val Lapidus: He said he was going to go show the packaging to the potential buyers. He's not selling it
[12/1/23, 9:00:51 PM] Gary Teh: Ok. Charge to DAO off chain balance
[12/1/23, 9:01:11 PM] Gary Teh: What did @19209806391 mentioned he would use the 18 ounces of cacao nibs for?
[12/1/23, 10:34:50 PM] Val Lapidus: He is bringing it as samples to sales meetings
[12/2/23, 4:27:58 AM] Gary Teh: Ok charge to DAO off chain balance then 🙂🙏
[12/2/23, 6:33:13 AM] Vlatko Gigov: correct.
[12/2/23, 6:34:12 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 how is it going? When do you have time today or tomorrow to assist with the deck prep?
[12/2/23, 6:37:59 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Do we have any info what we have sold so far from the ~100 kg? In units and quantity? 

What are the next quantities envisaged to be ordered for the US market? 

Will price per kg drop if we increase quantities?
[12/2/23, 6:42:59 AM] Val Lapidus: 1x12.5 kg sold
And 2x8oz sold
[12/2/23, 6:43:35 AM] Val Lapidus: No order plans at the moment
[12/2/23, 6:44:13 AM] Val Lapidus: Yes price should drop with volume
[12/2/23, 6:44:47 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Let’s maybe have these numbers so we can plan appropriately.
[12/2/23, 6:46:41 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @16468233438 I know you have opened the sales rep commissions discussions. I believe it’s a necessary carrot if we want to have a Herbalife style decentralized sales force. I’m opening up the discussions here first as it pertains to this current business model and the once we have flushed out few options we can put it up for voting in the town hall.
[12/2/23, 6:47:12 AM] Val Lapidus: Are u asking pricing for Switzerland?
[12/2/23, 6:48:39 AM] Vlatko Gigov: It will be good to form prices based on quantities and geography. We must have this info in the deck for Monday.
[12/2/23, 6:49:57 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 I think has the full picture of the supply chain cists

[12/2/23, 8:25:31 AM] Gary Teh: For cost of Brazil to Switzerland supply chain

you can calculate based on receipts submitted by Orlantildes 

Exact exchange rate charged by bank and fees are not evident yet

Fatima has yet made withdrawal from the OffChain USD balance maintained in my personal bank account
[12/2/23, 8:40:24 AM] Val Lapidus: @41799155602 I have asked our Brazilian supplier what type of price discounts there are when we order in larger quantities like 500 kilos or 1000 kilos I Will let you know when he responds
[12/2/23, 9:12:15 AM] Val Lapidus: @Val, we are going through a moment of high volatility in the price of almonds and you can follow this on the website investing.com. This year cocoa has already increased by approximately 70% and continues to increase.
Despite this, we can, yes, grant a discount for larger volumes.
Next week I will send our portfolio valid for the month of December here in the group. Every beginning of the month I will send you a new portfolio.
[12/2/23, 9:49:34 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Ok. Thanks. We need to be exact in forming prices and account for rising costs. The more current and anticipatory info the better.
[12/2/23, 9:50:33 AM] Vlatko Gigov: @31641075825 let me know about tomorrow. It’s important we dial in the deck.
[12/2/23, 9:50:43 AM] Val Lapidus: I don't know if there's a futures market for accountants, but you could look at leaps if there are and see what they're prising. Pretend
[12/2/23, 9:51:07 AM] Val Lapidus: Accountants I mean cacao nibs
[12/2/23, 9:54:21 AM] Vlatko Gigov: There is, but that’s at bulk. We are not there yet :)

[12/2/23, 12:59:59 PM] Gary Teh: The most equitable approach would be for the commission pay out to be done fully in TDG only. 

People who wants to cash out their TDG for fiat needs to go exchange them at official venues 

Having a component in our comps that pays out Fiat directly to participants undertaking any DAO related activity also sends out a *_very negative signal*_ to people familiar with cryptocurrency tokenomics 

When I studied the tokenomics presented to me by Nio in Dubai (_*who does pump and dump professionally*_) that is usually the back door he uses to drain the fiat from any tokenomics system he comes up with

And that is exactly how Ethan did it for his project wonderhero, another mainland Chinese enabled *_pump and dump scheme*_ that took place in Singapore ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/23, 1:02:17 PM] Gary Teh: I am open for the commission payout to be done in TDG 

And also for the commission payout formula that includes *_sales figure secured_* and *_DAO standard rate*_

Folks who are keen to crack their brains at it please feel free to surface some formula for consideration 

And then have the formula submitted in our @120363111951279022@g.us for voting 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/2/23, 1:07:09 PM] Vlatko Gigov: We are here only to disintegrate
[12/2/23, 1:07:49 PM] Vlatko Gigov: 👆
[12/2/23, 1:09:22 PM] Vlatko Gigov: maybe I’m wrong
[12/2/23, 1:10:32 PM] Val Lapidus: I want to point out that the margins on the possible commissions are not all that high. Because our price is already high and compared to other vendors, we need to be able to stay competitive while also offering a feel good story.  And one more point, there's no reason that those of us that are in developing countries can't do sales in the US or for that matter. Any territory where we can import the product into and collect on those commissions.  I think with a decent internet connection, you can make phone calls into the US. Find vendors that you want to send the sample to communicate with those vendors, get their address where to send their sample and then ask me to send out the sample.
[12/2/23, 1:11:33 PM] Val Lapidus: Everyone in this DAO can become part of the go-to market, and sell the product
[12/2/23, 1:11:39 PM] Val Lapidus: And earn commission
[12/2/23, 1:25:44 PM] Vlatko Gigov: I agree with you @16468233438
[12/2/23, 1:26:32 PM] Vlatko Gigov: So let’s map out the whole process in a nice % and value based timeline to get everyone accounted for
[12/2/23, 1:26:55 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Calling for an epistemological exercice in this inner circle
[12/2/23, 1:27:10 PM] Vlatko Gigov: D DAO is all about definitions.
[12/2/23, 1:28:43 PM] Vlatko Gigov: Maybe this is how we solve for inflation. Or maybe I am a communist
[12/2/23, 3:09:24 PM] Gary Teh: *Parts required*

1) verbal script that any DAO member can follow when telling Agroverse story 

2) a protocol which they can follow in DAO to work the script
[12/3/23, 4:49:05 AM] Gary Teh: For verbal script if someone want to come  up with an initial draft that has been tested to work, that would be great.

We can then modify this shared script as we use it to iterate with prospective buyers 🙂🙏
[12/3/23, 8:07:37 AM] Gary Teh: *_Proposed compensation plan*_

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply

[12/16/23, 10:30:35 AM] Gary Teh: Current pricing based on *3KG* from cooperative definitely will not match his target price… 

Current rate is at *USD6.15* per pound

Perhaps check with Orlantildes to see what his price is 

Worst case scenario, since the purpose of Agroverse is to help restore the rainforest, then perhaps Agroverse could consider foregoing all profit taking from future transactions 

_*Scenario A: If potential USA buyers have their own FSVP process already setup*_

 we could consider just providing them the contact details of Orlantildes and they could just deal with Orlantildes directly. 

Meanwhile we stop further deployment of human effort behind Agroverse initiative and if human effort does get involved, people contributing effort should just consider it *_charity work*_

*_Scenario B: if potential USA buyer does not have FSVP process setup and wants to utilize Agroverse FSVP infrastructure*_

We charge a fixed one off fee for each purchase

But buyer will have to conduct all the aliasing themselves and logistics arrangements themselves

Service provided by Agroverse should just be considered a self service solution with minimal to no hand holding provided by any DAO member

Ideally the Agroverse website should just allow them to simply fill up a form and pay up to receive shipment from all prevetted FSvP approved cooperatives

Price to be charged is then up to the cooperatives to keep updated ‎<This message was edited>

I have spent many years traversing the different parts of our world overland. 

I am in awe of the beauty and diversity I saw during my travels, its people, its culture and its nature. 

I very much hope that my daughter when she grows up will get to experience this same sense of awe when she sees how beautiful this world is

Right now I am contributing to a community project to help restore our rainforest 

This project involves distributing cacao nibs that are grown using regenerative techniques in the Atlantic rainforest  

could I get your help to safeguard this beautiful world of ours for our dearly loved ones 🙂🙏

I have forwarded our Agroverse website and whitepaper to him. These along with three bags of samples I am bringing over to Switzerland with me will be featured during the Systemic Change Forum happening in Davos on the 13th of Jan. It will be in an intimate setting with a few participants. We will make some chocolate with these samples and share with the guests there

Meanwhile he has also extended invitation to another private forum that will be happening on the 17th. I understood that the CEOs of Unilever and Chanel will be present. During that session we will be exploring how we can transition our economy from one of fear and greed to one that is based on compassion 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[12/27/23, 12:01:12 PM] Gary Teh: You definitely should. It will surface all your past trauma, mental and emotional blocks for you to work on during your 4 hour session consulting with the mushroom. It is a highly beneficial experience for people who seek to live life on the edge much like how you have been living. 

Much like ayuhuasca or even extended period of sitting meditation, you will come away from the experience with less needless striving in your life and more time just being in the state of flow by simply allowing the universe to naturally unfold.

It is not just chocolate you are buying. You are buying a future for your kids 🙂🙏

When you buy our cacao you know exactly which portion of this wonderous ecosystem your money is being channeled towards to help with ecosystem preservation and regeneration

Right now farmers are throwing in the towel and opting to sell off their land cheaply to mainland Chinese entrepreneurs who are then chopping down the forest to grow soy bean.

The reason they give up is because middle men are siphoning off the margins for their own personal gains. Siphoning off the future of your children ‎<This message was edited>

*_Content of message…*_

Cost price breakdown to us for this 3kg of cacao nibs and Kraft pouch 

_Total cost we incurred: USD14.10_

Cost of buying and shipping 8 ounce of cacao nibs to Switzerland: USD13.46

Cost of Kraft pouch: USD0.64

I will leave it to you to decide the final price you want to quote Migros.  

If you want to offer a price below cost to them, then someone needs to find people with money willing to donate to project to offset cost incurred 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/5/24, 8:58:49 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Calculation is obsolete as it doesn’t account for scale: quantity and packaging.
[1/5/24, 9:01:46 AM] Vlatko Gigov: Any luck of getting this done sometime soon?
[1/5/24, 9:03:54 AM] Gary Teh: Trying to get @16468233438 to pay Ecuador supplier for the shipping cost he incurred shipping the samples to us 

I am so far away from civilization and have also just lost my car keys last night. 

I technically have 1 day supply of water and food. 

Worst case scenario if I don’t find my car keys soon, I will finally do my final Do Nothing ritual for this incarnation - the *_Shokushinbutsu ceremony*_ 🙂🙏

[1/5/24, 9:13:25 AM] Gary Teh: Aha! The universe has decided to once again delay my *_shokushinbutsu ritual*_ 

Life continues its beginning and meaningless meandering 🙂🙏

[1/5/24, 10:21:07 AM] Gary Teh: Valentine is based in UK

Would we be keen to ship him a sample?

My assumption is if he is really going to scale this up then the supplies will come from the supply chain that @41799155602 is right now overseeing the setup of 🙂🙏
[1/6/24, 1:27:02 AM] Suheil - Europe: hello, i will make the best to have it done toniight so that we can re sit on it tomorroow?

[1/8/24, 7:30:40 AM] Suheil - Europe: i think by now you have realized that I am surrounded by top talents only 🤣🤣🤣
I have a strategy in mind to re-build a team around me to full gaz again on agroverse ops.  but this time it will need to be differently. 

first thing i learned from my first season, not to involve experts directly with groups here ( they get lost, complicated, then run away) …. anyways i am brainstoarming it will send my input in townhall when i got it 😅

[1/9/24, 9:14:11 AM] Gary Teh: 2.2 metric tons a month for now

That is the maximum capacity the cooperative can handle right now

[1/22/24, 9:58:36 PM] Gary Teh: When tested people like to add cacao nibs to their morning smoothie as it adds a nice crunch to it.

I feel that before we allow new members into our guild, we need to define what our guild needs and then interview folks who have requested to join.  

A match is when activities incoming member desire to undertake matches needs of guild over the upcoming 90 day period. Otherwise we keep the slot empty.

Thoughts? 🙂🙏
[2/6/24, 7:17:55 AM] Gary Teh: Folks please share what you feel is important for this guild and what role you would be keen to actively play over the next 90 days within the scope of what you have defined as important

[2/6/24, 8:39:05 AM] Vlatko Gigov: 💫 welcome @41764184108 it is here where we aim to disintermediate the supply chain and bring greater value to farmers. Starting with cacao nibs and sustainable farming methods while protecting the amazon rain forest in Brazil. ❤️
[2/6/24, 1:20:04 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 I relooked into our costing of our most recent shipment from Brazil into USA

*Cost of the goods itself*
- 100KG cacao nibs: $R6500 = USD1,310.3846

*Cost of the transportation and customs* 
- _Leitl Express_ - Trucking from Ilheus to Salvador: $R1066.85 = USD215.11019
- _Omega Services_ - Air Freight from Salvador to SF Airport: $R4000 = USD806.53795
- _SeaCoast Logistics_ - Custom Clearance at SF Airport: USD561.03

If our goal is to bring cost per KG down to USD20 and still pay the farmers the fair price they are asking for than shipping and freighting cost needs to go down. 

Four options to optimize our supply chain bound for USA
- ⁠Find cheaper freight forwarding company
- ⁠Do sea freight instead of air freight
- Increase shipping volume to acquire economies of scale. _but first we need to decipher which cost is fixed and which cost is variable_
- ⁠Figure out how to do customs clearance ourselves to save on the USD561.03 by removing SeaCoast Logistics from the equation. _Doesn’t feel like Grazie is actually doing much for us but still charging us stuff_.

The ledger of records for the shipment could be found here
https://edgar.truesight.me/agl2

Time taken to perform cost analysis 30 minutes

[2/7/24, 9:23:43 AM] Patrick - Davos: Greetings. I have been involved with a DAO based organisation called United Religions Initiative since 2008 and it was founded in 2000. For many years, during the 90s, hundreds came together to consult how to create a decentralised movement, VISA and Bay Area ecosystem and world wide scholars, indigenous elders, interfaith activists, religious leaders of all kinds, NGOs etc etc came together to create this. It is the Proof of Point of DAO which is now 24 years old ‎<This message was edited>
[2/7/24, 9:23:47 AM] Patrick - Davos: Preamble

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Purpose

The purpose of the United Religions Initiative is to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.
[2/7/24, 9:24:37 AM] Patrick - Davos: here is a snapshot of this framework, which can be transferred to out movements as well. Many others started out with same methodology, but only the URI survived 2008 and beyond to make a proof of point
[2/7/24, 9:41:12 AM] Gary Teh: Wonderful! This sounds like a much larger conversation than with this guild. Perhaps we should bring this to the @120363041505997891@g.us where the bulk of the DAO folks are? 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[2/10/24, 7:32:42 AM] Suheil - Europe: i have no idea honestly, i am more than happy to help anyone in specific related assignments . for the moment i am very outdated of whats up here and not finding my ability to lead anything specific. if needed happy to leave my seat for someone else
[2/10/24, 7:49:47 AM] Gary Teh: Would you be keen to help lead the efforts for a new version of our cacao nibs package? 

_Requirements_
- QR code on package that links back to Agroverse.shop

- ⁠we are right now exploring organic cacao nibs sources from Africa. If it works out (_identified as good quality and no slavery_) we might need another version of our package design sourced from Africa. 

Thoughts?? ‎<This message was edited>
[2/10/24, 7:57:49 AM] Suheil - Europe: ya sure. how is sales iin the US going ? @16468233438  did the pitch we prepare together make of use of anything at the end? 😀
[2/10/24, 7:58:48 AM] Suheil - Europe: @14153000019 you are still around europe ?
[2/10/24, 8:03:49 AM] Gary Teh: That pitch deck you prepared is being used by @41799155602 

@41799155602 could you give an update on status in Europe 🙂🙏
[2/10/24, 8:06:14 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 @19209806391, @12245781775 and myself are basically making phone calls or paying actual visits to chocolatiers in USA 

Personally I haven’t really used the pitch deck. I mainly just walk up to them at their stores present the cacao nibs samples and have them taste it

And ask if they would be keen to place an order now or if not get their contact information to follow up again when they are at a time when they are ready to place an order
[2/10/24, 8:06:46 AM] Gary Teh: I had to return to USA urgently two weeks ago as they shutdown my bank account 😱
[2/10/24, 8:08:20 AM] Suheil - Europe: ahhhh great u caught urself and good that u still have a bank account, something that i shouldn’t get near it again in my life hhh cash is king 😂😂😂
[2/10/24, 8:10:27 AM] Gary Teh: I think the QR code portion is quite critical. Right now, there is no direct linkage between the product and our online presence 🙂🙏

Let me know if you would be keen to undertake that piece
[2/10/24, 8:11:58 AM] Suheil - Europe: yes. i can make it even spicier. 

QR code linked to mint your NFT . 

You have very good artistic imagination. do you have in mind what ART i can use ?
[2/10/24, 8:17:11 AM] Gary Teh: Try using one of these

[2/10/24, 8:21:36 AM] Suheil - Europe: well first is to be in direct contact with consumers then you can drop them whatever we want
[2/10/24, 8:22:49 AM] Suheil - Europe: i was thinking from the perspective of QR code on the bought bag.

what you saay is also doable. mint your nft and receive your bag
[2/10/24, 8:25:14 AM] Gary Teh: The minting NfT route would only appeal to a smaller audience. Very effortful for none web3 folks 

I think the QR code on the cacao nibs bag approach will be more useful initially 

I am trying to minimize the effort that person has to spend comprehending the product ‎<This message was edited>
[2/10/24, 8:26:09 AM] Suheil - Europe: the premier case is being used largely now by brands like L’oreal and others . brands that have no direct connection with their consumers as most of their products are sold via 3rd parties.

which can be our case when sold viia 3rd parties. but if we are anyways selling directly then NFT has no real use as we anyways have their direct contact database
[2/10/24, 8:26:56 AM] Gary Teh: Yup. Let’s hold off on the NFts for now 🙂🙏
[2/10/24, 8:29:18 AM] Suheil - Europe: but now i re raise the attention, how come you say there is no direct linkage if we are talking about direct sales? if bag got sold directly via amazon or manually with your hands, we don;t have customers contact ?
[2/10/24, 8:36:05 AM] Gary Teh: If someone else sees the bag that is left on the table or the display, how do they even know there is a website associated with it??
[2/10/24, 8:36:44 AM] Suheil - Europe: right . touche

- ⁠Amazon: it’s all over their boxes (_now that their brand is publicly know, no need for QR code_)

[2/14/24, 2:16:43 PM] Gary Teh: Does it include cacao nibs price or is it just freighting cost?

*Format of social sharing session* 

- when invited to more intimate pot luck at various camps in the desert bring grinded cacao nibs in Moka pot 

- ⁠boil Moka pot over fire 

- ⁠have everyone have a cup of it, mixed with oat milk 

- ⁠once they tasted how delicious it is, share the story 

*Ideas for format extension*

- 2 ounce sample bags with our brand and QR code linking back to our site 
- ⁠more ways to consume it 

*CTAs to test*

[2/19/24, 1:58:24 PM] Gary Teh: What do you have in mind to build?
[2/19/24, 3:21:23 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 45 minutes reviewing this tutorial on:

- how to setup affiliate marketing on Wix using GoAffPro 3rd party app
- ⁠how to identify influencers that can promote our cacao nibs 
- ⁠how to reach out to these influencers 

https://youtu.be/vGbPFQyffnA?si=y-XVP3TOqxbUzGbK
[2/19/24, 7:38:50 PM] Gary Teh: How does this align with your personal OKR over the next 90 days? 

Or if your personal OKR has changed, do let us know what is it? 

Also how does this align with the goals of our guild for this year? 🙂🙏
[2/19/24, 9:21:53 PM] Gary Teh: *Problem statement for @120363044028036610@g.us* 

Exploitative middlemen diminish earnings for cacao and commodity farmers. Meanwhile, in developing nations, land is sold cheaply to Chinese corporations, transforming it into soybean and cattle farms, contributing to deforestation and climate change. How do we break this vicious cycle?
[2/19/24, 9:22:24 PM] Gary Teh: And this seems to be the set of hypotheses that @120363044028036610@g.us aims to validate 

- it is possible to crowdsource the setup and operations of a supply chain

- ⁠crowdsourcing can yield produces that restore communities and regenerates environment 

- ⁠integrity can be crowdsourced to tackle existing fraud in shipping industry which has caused banks to stop issuing Letter of Credits
[2/19/24, 9:30:56 PM] Gary Teh: Personal OKR for next 90 days 

*Objective*
- enable direct to consumer strategy 

*Key results*
- setup affiliate marketing program for USA territory via Wix 

- ⁠setup outreach script to use on influencers 

- ⁠test script on at least 25 influencers with at least 1000 followers and attempt to onboard them
[2/19/24, 9:49:54 PM] Gary Teh: _PS: upon closer examination of my personal OKRs, I am taking a step back from the direct to chocolatier objective_

_That objective is something that @16468233438 decided he wanted to undertake because that aligns well with his profile strength._

_I just realized I got distracted from my core focus when @12245781775, @41799155602 and @19209806391 reached out late last year regarding @16468233438 objective 😱_

Barbara is helping source for suppliers based in Brazil to help us in our supply chain reconfiguration process 

*Objective*
- relocate manufacturing for final products sold in USA and European markets into Brazil

*Key results for next 90 days*

- find supplier for packaging 

- ⁠provide information needed by packaging supplier to move ahead once we are ready to place order for next shipment ‎<This message was edited>
[2/20/24, 7:17:32 AM] Gary Teh: @554792591729 we are right now waiting for @16468233438 to consolidate the freighting cost and their corresponding freighting volumes
[2/20/24, 7:20:18 AM] Gary Teh: @554792591729 meanwhile could you help follow up with the packaging supplier to find out what they need from us before they can start printing the packaging?
[2/20/24, 7:24:15 AM] Barbara Sandini: Yes I did ask some examples of printing

[2/20/24, 5:53:17 PM] Gary Teh: This one would be what we would go for
[2/20/24, 5:56:28 PM] Val Lapidus: We have 1,000 bags printed and ready to go in the US.  Let's be cognizant of that fact
[2/20/24, 5:59:05 PM] Gary Teh: The cost of packing the cacao nibs into bags in USA is too high

What we could do is bring those 1000 bags over to Brazil in a hand luggage before the next shipment is prepared. That way, packing is done in Brazil instead
[2/20/24, 5:59:34 PM] Gary Teh: By the way has the Brazilian cooperative received what you shipped over?
[2/20/24, 6:00:54 PM] Val Lapidus: Let's make sure we work through the supply available in the Americas of The packed bags before we direct any packaging to happen in Brazil.  The only reason we would do a order right now for additional nibs in the US is to fulfill orders that are for large-scale bulk orders. We have no need for consumer product unless suddenly that channel starts making sales.
[2/20/24, 6:01:47 PM] Gary Teh: How is the status of the freighting cost?
[2/20/24, 6:02:13 PM] Val Lapidus: I will tabulate this information on the 23rd when I return home
[2/20/24, 6:04:08 PM] Gary Teh: It is important to lock down the business development task and make sure our package printing supplier based in Brazil have what they need to immediately start operating when we press the START button 

Otherwise that will hamper sales and marketing activities once that side ramps up

As the Brazilian coop mentioned lag time is 2 months ‎<This message was edited>

[2/20/24, 11:18:20 PM] Gary Teh: Key insight speaking to Butterfly yesterday for 30 minutes 

For YouTube influencers there is range of subscriber level beyond which influencers start getting a cut of the YouTube ad revenue 

Below that level, there is no easy way for them to monetize

[2/23/24, 5:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we have collected more qualitative data from the market on⁩ cacao nibs 

*Marketing 4Ps of our cacao nibs re-examined*

_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality because of care and deliberate attention during processing 
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

[2/26/24, 9:25:15 AM] Suheil - Europe: so to make sure my lately dumb braiin gets it , just to update the bullet points mentioned iin the meessage of before?
[2/26/24, 10:00:44 AM] Gary Teh: Here are the bullet points:

• Larger sized chunks for better quality and more crunch
• Balanced taste due to careful processing
• Fresher product with less time on shelf
• More flavorful with a satisfying crunch
• Sustainable farming technique that restores rainforests
• Competitive pricing without sacrificing quality

These points highlight the unique selling points of our cacao nibs
[2/27/24, 9:02:38 AM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 How much lag time do you think you will need to pack the rest of the 300 bags of cacao nibs from our existing stock pile in California?

Some of the influencers have a very sizable following. In a home run scenario, we will be out of stock while demand still surges in. That will lead to bad reputation on our side and discourage these influencers from collaborating with us due to poor supply chain management. 

Let me know. What are you thoughts on calibrating demand to the supply that we have right now?

Which this got sent on ur email and u confirmed that u got it thank you.

Then you re asked her another thing that I wasn't aware about even 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
[3/2/24, 6:55:33 AM] Suheil - Europe: So this question s answer is that annia did supply the package design with qr code. 

Validate or not?
[3/2/24, 6:58:13 AM] Suheil - Europe: I think that you wanted to ask me about updated deck. Which is the last thing that I know that I still didn't deliver. ?
[3/2/24, 7:02:29 AM] Gary Teh: Just received the latest from her 

Could you indicate how much time was spent on it?

[3/2/24, 8:10:01 AM] Val Lapidus: crunchier.  why?  you arent’ comparing it to anything.  shouldn’t it just be crunchy
[3/2/24, 8:10:16 AM] Val Lapidus: seems like a grammatical mistake to me.
[3/2/24, 8:14:57 AM] Val Lapidus: also I believe our nutritional info is incorrect:
https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1890432/nutrients

at a quick glance this product has 6g of carb for 3 tbsp, which is not keto friendly at all.  
calculated by using: Total Carb (11g) - Dietary Fiber (5g) = 6g net carb
according to US FDA document that I linked above, it should be:
Total Carb(10g) - Dietary Fiber (8.99g) = 1.01 net carb which is much more Keto friendly

sellers should quote any request for 100kg or more, should quote the 25-100kg price, this way you have room for negotiation, also anything over the price guidance becomes your commission

[3/5/24, 6:20:19 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps find a supplier and get a quotation
[3/5/24, 9:29:40 PM] Gary Teh: That is all I can say. Too busy right now doing sales and marketing for our cacao nibs 

Not time to look into product development related matters. At least for the next few quarters

[3/6/24, 8:26:08 PM] Gary Teh: Could you do an inventory check on how much loss cacao nibs we have and how many 8 ounce bags we have left
[3/6/24, 8:31:24 PM] Gary Teh: Will need to figure out the proper accounting treatment for this sale that does not cause an infarction into the agreement listed in shipment contract AGL2.

Basically if we are selling the 25kg right at the new price we will be selling it at a loss 

This doesn’t reflect well to future investors when we surface the financial performance history to them when we want to bring in the 1 ton cacao nibs… aka USD21K++

_PS: I am short of liquidity on my side. I won’t be financing the next shipment. So if we can’t find any financiers to come up with the necessary capital to finance the USD21K, there is be no future Agroverse cacao nibs shipment into USA_

_hope it is becoming apparent why I am taking the profitability of this AGL2 shipment so seriously_

_I am using the performance of AGL2 as evidence that we have a working viable model for future fundraising purposes 🙂🙏_ ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/24, 8:34:30 PM] Val Lapidus: I can pay but perhaps we should have a majority of the next shipment already sold

[3/7/24, 3:36:09 AM] Gary Teh: Will send you an invoice for 25KG based on pricing structure stated in contract AGL2
[3/7/24, 3:49:04 AM] Gary Teh: After further consideration, there is No reason to justify offloading AGL2 inventory at a lost now

Direct to consumer Sales and marketing has just started revving up. 

If we start depleting our inventory at a loss before the effects of our sales and marketing efforts start manifesting, we will just end up shooting ourselves in the foot 

This will just reflect very badly to future investors in AGL contracts who can conclude the AGL contracts are managed by a bunch of incompetent imbeciles who don’t know what they are doing ‎<This message was edited>
[3/7/24, 3:50:36 AM] Gary Teh: I would propose we start floating the AGL3 contract sooner rather than later.

The registration number entry for importer was missing. I noticed TikTok listed it in our product listing product and updated it into our document.

It is the number we get when registering our company with FDA as an importer

_PS: in hindsight, I realized we jumped through a lot of legal hoops setting up the supply chain into USA last year. Its amazing we even managed to figure out how to do in the first place_ ‎<This message was edited>
[3/7/24, 1:36:07 PM] Gary Teh: TikTok’s free shipping policy is making our cacao nibs very competitive against Amazon free shipping policy 

The main difference is we don’t pay extra for customers to have the same benefits of free shipping
[3/7/24, 7:14:01 PM] Gary Teh: Actually before we place the order for that I will need to fly down to Ilheus to certify that facility that processes the 1 ton per month cacao otherwise we will get into problem with FdA during the audit
[3/8/24, 9:30:23 AM] Gary Teh: Discussion had with @16468233438 

Once we hit the 50 bags sold or 50% inventory depletion mark, I will pay a visit to our suppliers in Brazil to achieve two objectives 

- certify cooperative facility which processes 1ton of cacao nibs per month for export into USA

- ⁠pass existing supply of kraft pouches in USA to Brazilian cooperative

- ⁠visit the Kraft pouch package printing company to start making arrangements to hook up the supply chain

They also supply non-GMO wheat which one of @554792591729 personal contact was looking purchase
[3/8/24, 12:17:22 PM] Val Lapidus: has any one we know done business with them successfully?  In my most recent interaction, I asked them for a quote to deliver 5kg to me.  they gave me the quote, took the money, and now are saying they will deliver half of the 5kg now and the other half when we put in our order of 1000kg
[3/8/24, 12:18:03 PM] Val Lapidus: they are citing the cost to ship, however their initial quote for the 5kg included shipping
[3/8/24, 12:20:29 PM] Gary Teh: No one has done business with them yet
[3/8/24, 12:20:47 PM] Gary Teh: That is why we are asking for samples and then going through the rest of the verification process 

- FDA approval 
- ⁠facility visit to verify they are legit
- ⁠supply chain audit

People from first world countries like Singapore, western Europe and America have very different expectations than people from 3rd world countries have very different expectations on how the world is supposed to work. 

Reminds me of my first time backpacking through Cambodia, a 3rd world country, when I was still in colleague 

It was a very frustrating experience but very insightful 🙂🙏

PS: once I got it in my head that time is very very flexible in 3rd world countries, the level of frustration drop to almost non-existence. 

When I was at the border of Cambodia 5 minutes of wait time actually means 7 hours of wait time ‎<This message was edited>

[3/9/24, 10:45:06 AM] Suheil - Europe: I am sorry @19209806391 

I have the presentation open in front of me

I read shared bullet points.

I see most of stuff already mentioned in last version of the ppt . Adding another slide would be to repetitive.

I suggest I add new slides as more descriptif like:
-  special farming techniques:
From who I can get more details to describe in a slide . Instead of just putting it as bulle point
[3/9/24, 10:45:59 AM] Suheil - Europe: Need to be more quantitative.  Size: let's give an idea (not necessaliry accurate size but describe in a way that gives idea to the reader)
[3/9/24, 10:48:04 AM] Suheil - Europe: Where I can find details about the careful processing. To be able to diagram it or similar

[3/10/24, 7:00:01 AM] Gary Teh: I have given more thought to the commission structure proposed

This approach is not going to be cost effective, time conserving and capital efficient 

*_Proposed alternative*_
Once minimal
Viable growth model is proven for chocolatier distribution route , we should start redirecting parts of the profits to retain the service of a call center to work through the sales lead list using a call script which have been tested to work. 

*_Advantages to this approach*_
- doesn’t rely on self-motivation

- ⁠doesn’t rely on whether contributor has time and availability to get stuff done 

- ⁠it becomes the employees full time job with a fixed weekly quota of calls he needs to hit. That will be defined in the SLA agreement we set in place with the call center

[3/12/24, 9:21:31 AM] Gary Teh: @554792591729 could you help source for the contact details of more cooperatives based in Bahia that sells organic cacao nibs

@16468233438 feels that the price we are getting from the current cooperative we are working with is not competitive. We need to do a price check against other cooperatives in the region. 

Thanks 🙂🙏

I just remembered, I had a conversation with Victor late last year. I mentioned I will follow up with him once we figured out our initial supply chain of cacao nibs into USA. He has a contact list for supply chain that will absorb up to 22 tons per month of chocolate into just San Francisco Bay Area

We already figured out how to ship cacao nibs into USA last year before I entered into the monastery

_As an experiment, I will hit the influencers on this same list again over the next few days but using their emails for those that have them listed and tracking to see if they even opened the emails._ ‎<This message was edited>

- ⁠Follow up with African supplier to get details required for USA FDA registration and FSVP qualification

[3/21/24, 9:13:47 AM] Gary Teh: *Unit economics for cacao nibs:*
- Cost price: USD7.5 per bag
- ⁠Retail price: USD12 per bag
- ⁠TikTok platform cost: USD0.96 which is 8% 
- ⁠Commission to influencer: USD1.2
- ⁠Net profit per bag sold: USD2.34
- ⁠Each bag of cacao nibs sample given away needs to generate at least 4 bags of sales for us to break even: *USD9.36 > USD7.50*
- ⁠Target sales per sample: USD48

*Statistics by TikTok platform on influencers*
- Average revenue generated per 1000 views on TikTok based on their provided statistics is *USD15*. 

*TikTok influencers filter condition*
- 1 sample translates to 1 video
- ⁠1 video needs to generate USD48 of sales

- It takes time to break into an industry on the sales side since its about having a network of relationships already established in the industry. ⁠For Agroverse B2B sales to chocolatiers, recruit senior sales people in the chocolate industry

- ⁠Regarding scaling of farmers market, instead of running stores ourselves, reach out to existing vendors who offer complimentary products and propose collaboration

- Campus have foods stores that sell snacks. That might be a potential distribution channel


*Actionable next steps*
- access to ⁠communications to suppliers to be restricted to active governors only

- ⁠Adding farmer market vendors collaboration as

•⁠  ⁠initial small sample not more than USD250 in value upon first contact, to mitigate against a rug pull as well as to ensure quality is good before sinking further resources into the relationship

- ⁠right now bulk price in the market is $50-60 Reis per KG. Which is around more than US$10 per KG.

- ⁠ so organic price when it is set should be more than $20 per KG. 

- ⁠Prices are almost equivalent to the prices of Coopercabruca in Bahia

- ⁠ right now there are no supplies in the market for organic Cacao

- ⁠ prices for the organic cacao will be set once all the 130 family have completed their harvest

[7/23/24, 8:07:57 AM] Gary Teh: @14102184337 As per this screenshot you can see May 11th Robert was in Colorado with me to meet about the cacao and we end up meeting at the gym and I got this shot.
[7/23/24, 8:10:00 AM] Gary Teh: For final cacao molasses  retail prices for USA consumers in usd… Not yet

Need to conduct the following steps
- Need to include the freighting cost 
- ⁠then research the current price per ounce for honey
- ⁠ USA consumers will most likely put this in the category of honey
- ⁠ we will market this as the vegan version of honey
[7/23/24, 8:19:17 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Absolutely, so sorry for that
[7/23/24, 8:20:39 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Do you need me to do again the ones I already sent? It seemed to me you have fixed it. I appreciate that and moving forward I’ll send text and images separate.

We are only bringing 100 bottles for this upcoming shipment to test the market ‎<This message was edited>
[7/23/24, 3:27:26 PM] Gary Teh: Need to model that once we have the actual cost when it arrives in USA

We could probably offer $9 to reseller if they are buying at least 10 bottles. 

Price excludes shipping

That is how we are doing  for the $10 8 ounce cacao nibs bags too ‎<This message was edited>

[7/23/24, 3:56:32 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: How can it say is without added sugar but have added sugar on the nutrition label?
[7/23/24, 4:01:02 PM] Gary Teh: It seems like an irony actually
[7/23/24, 4:02:41 PM] Gary Teh: To make 4 L of molasses 8 L of cacao honey is added with four KG of sugar

If we don’t feel comfortable with this, we can choose to not include it in the upcoming shipment

Personally, I’m really agnostic about this 

What are your thoughts? ‎<This message was edited>

[7/23/24, 5:41:27 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I don’t think we should say that it doesn’t have added sugar when in fact does. It takes away credibility from the brand.
[7/23/24, 5:43:13 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I feel like you could either focus of marketing cacao honey and claim is NO added sugars. Or you have molasses but be transparent about the high added sugar.
[7/23/24, 5:46:28 PM] Gary Teh: I think to market cacao honey, we need to find a factory that knows how to can it and preserve the content. I am sure the US market would love it. And there is not something like this in the market yet.
[7/23/24, 5:47:00 PM] Gary Teh: That is very true. We should just be very transparent about it.

I am going to field test this 100 bottles at the Autumn Okanogen Barter Faire in Washington state as well as the Arizona High desert during quartzite. If the demographic is receptive and we do sell out on the Molasses, we double down on it and scale up this product inventory ‎<This message was edited>

[7/24/24, 5:45:57 PM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 this was not a normal package.  It is not simply me going to my basement pulling out two packs and getting them ready.  If a customer has a special request to have the nibs processed prior to shipment, we should set an expectation that it will ship within 7 days of order.  This will help me align my time in order to facilitate a special order.  I have no issue shipping normal orders where it's just me putting it into a package but this required extra processing and extra work on my part.  With that said, I'll issue you a tracking number in just one moment
[7/24/24, 5:51:08 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm trying to log into stamps.com to print out a shipping label.  I remember now we talked about you canceling the stamps.com subscription.  Am I supposed to pay for the shipping out of my pocket?
[7/24/24, 6:08:20 PM] Gary Teh: We agreed that we cancelled it last month. 

Share the reciept here and I will transfer you via Venmo from the amount that Alice paid
[7/24/24, 6:09:50 PM] Gary Teh: Wonderful

I think we want to sell in the US should all be produced in Brazil and package ready for sale in the future 

No more post processing in USA as it is very costly and time-consuming

I don’t have direct access to the factory in São Paulo yet. I only have Dany as a contact person who connected me with this supplier.
The manufacturer in São Paulo shipped the sample to Dany who lives in Goiânia, in the state of Goiás. From Goiânia, Dany shipped the sample to Robert in Arkansas.
[7/25/24, 5:34:55 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: To this address you have circled is Dany’s address.
[7/25/24, 5:36:15 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: The plan so far is to wait for Robert to receive the sample and if he likes and want to explore this supplier, I will arrange with Dany to connect you, Gary, with the São Paulo supplier so you can work the deal for Robert.
[7/25/24, 5:37:50 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: So, @14153000019, once the sample is approved by Robert, I will connect you with the São Paulo supplier through Dany, and Robert will get his butter from them through you.

Let me know if that’s not how it should flow.

It’s still Dany’s contact at this point.
[7/25/24, 5:56:04 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, that is how it flows 

The supplier to the FSVP importer on record with FDA and then to Robert’s company
[7/25/24, 5:58:13 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Awesome 😎
On the right track then 🙏🏼

Sample should be in Arkansas by Tuesday, if we give him a couple days to check it out and make a batch sample we should have some answers from Robert by the end of next week. I’ll keep you posted 🫡

Both of them graduated with degree in international negotiations. Unfortunately, there was no such opportunities for jobs in this area. 

Ian specializes in package design too 

Both of them work for this Portuguese marketing company as their day job

Ian and emelyn mentioned they would be happy and open to making calls to set appointments 

Let me know if this is something that you might find helpful for your outreach as well ‎<This message was edited>
[7/27/24, 12:26:32 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I haven’t crafted out a strategy yet. I would like to reach out to local stores because I believe my local area is rich in high end natural stores and the public here is very receptive to this type of product. I am not comfortable approaching local retailers to make initial contact without a portfolio or something.

Yes, I would love to be on calls that would help me in this process. Just let me know what you need from me to set up the calls.
[7/27/24, 12:27:45 PM] Gary Teh: Which site we can reference to generate a contact list 

Best if you can provide some url
[7/27/24, 12:28:15 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I don’t understand
[7/27/24, 12:29:02 PM] Gary Teh: For example, performing a search on yelp for the list of companies that you would like outreach assistance for

[7/28/24, 7:26:59 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes discussing with Matheus on what is expected for the raw video footages

- Footage just needs to be submitted to the Agroverse channel by Saturday so that they could be shared on Sunday to @916380555310 and she has enough time to start using them to populate the Monday and Wednesday slots
- ⁠ when paying for fuel expenses take a photo of the receipts and send to me submit here in the Agroverse channel. So that we can use it for USA tax reporting purposes.
- ⁠ Monday slots are for about the culture of Ilheus chocolate culture
- ⁠ Wednesday slots are about the chocolate industry and chocolate farming
- ⁠ format should be portrait 
- ⁠ should also include commentary byMatheus
- ⁠ can include portrait photos, but must also have videos
- ⁠ I will transfer him R$500 first day of every month via Pix to cover the fuel cost ‎<This message was edited>

What is your planned approach of talking about the product to the grocery store owner during your visit once the appointment is setup, do you need some inventory handy? ‎<This message was edited>

[7/30/24, 3:25:27 PM] Gary Teh: I’m thinking the unique value proposition (_UVP_) might be different for the manufacturers (_like Robert_) and the grocers 

Reason is because we are selling packaged product to the grocers and raw materials to the manufacturers

Pain point of grocers is the ability to provide something that’s highly differentiated compared to the larger retail chains out so that consumers will visit their shop as opposed to just Walmart or Safeway which offer products that are cheaper and provide more variety

*_Our UVP to them: a product that consumers know when they buy helps restore the Amazon rainforest_*

manufacturers already have their own product. However, climate change is disrupting their supply chain thereby eating into their profit margin. What they are hoping for is the ability to protect their profit margin while still fulfilling their customer’s demand

*_our UVP to them, the ability to take control of their own Supply Chain, be fully in charge of their company’s own destiny  and no longer subjected to the oppression of the large middleman_*

Something to keep in mind when interacting with the two different customer profiles

Some of those places in Durango I have personal contact with.
Can I run through this list and contact some of them personally instead of them getting call from Matheus?
[8/4/24, 8:45:47 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Just saying because like I mentioned, I’ve been in this area since 2017. I worked as a compliance officer for 4 years at a local bank so I personally know a lot of the owners of those establishments .
[8/4/24, 8:46:39 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Can I have next week to contact the ones I have access to myself and leave the other ones to @557391090002 or Matheus can focus on helping Val next week while I contact them.
[8/4/24, 8:47:35 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Unless there’s a reason I’m not aware about. Which is fine. 😊

Just thinking it will be weird for Matheus to call and then me to show up and then to say “Hey Milena, why you didn’t reach out to begin with?” 😅
[8/4/24, 8:48:18 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: On another note, it might be beneficial since Matheus knows a bit more about the Agroverse than I do.

Just trying to bring your attention to this matter. Let me know what you would ultimately like to do.
‎[8/4/24, 8:50:48 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: ‎image omitted
[8/4/24, 8:51:49 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. Have next week to do that 

And Matheus can start on this area the week after 

Meanwhile he can focus on San Francisco
[8/4/24, 8:51:49 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Spent 5 minutes on the Agroverse Chanel proposing a different approach for Durango, Colorado sales strategy.
[8/4/24, 8:52:29 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Deal, I’ll work on it this week and we can cross out the places I have contacted. 🫡
[8/4/24, 8:53:10 AM] Gary Teh: The places you have worked on, just indicate your name in the list that way @557391090002 doesn’t have to work on them anymore

On the question about product attributes 

The word we should focus on is not *_better*_ but *_different*_

The *_Difference*_ that matters to our target audience in the USA ‎<This message was edited>
‎[8/7/24, 7:27:53 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[8/7/24, 8:01:21 PM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes crafting up the product attribute sheet which differentiates the cacao nibs we are bringing into the USA compared to other cacao nibs that are available in the USA market

_Core Product Attributes:_

1. _Unique Flavor Profile_: Fine flavored organic cacao nibs with up to 90% fermentation, resulting in a strong aromatic flavor.
2. _Balanced Taste_: Suitable as a snack on its own, unlike other cacao nibs which are often used as raw ingredients.
3. _Competitive Pricing_: On par with or slightly lower than USA competitors due to supply chain optimization.
4. _Fermentation Level_: Up to 90% fermentation, compared to 70% or no fermentation in other cacao nibs.
5. _Post-Fermentation Processing_: Calibrated drying and roasting for the American taste bud, enhancing the flavor profile.
6. _Freshness_: Imported in small batches to ensure optimal freshness and crunchiness.

_Augmented Attributes:_

1. _Award-Winning Cacao_: International Cacao Excellence Award winner for 3 consecutive years.
2. _Single-Sourced_: Traceable to specific farms, ensuring transparency and quality control.
3. _Sustainable Farming_: Grown using traditional Cabruca Agroforestry method, promoting aforestation and reducing deforestation.
4. _Fair Trade Practices_: Farmers receive 34% of profits, encouraging continued use of sustainable farming methods.
5. _Environmental Impact_: Cabruca method balances land nutrients, eliminating the need for fertilizers and pesticides.
6. _Supply Chain Optimization_: Efficient supply chain management ensures competitive pricing without compromising quality.
7. _Region-Specific_: Sourced from Bahia, where unique terroir and climate conditions contribute to the distinct flavor profile.
8. _Texture_: Crunchy texture due to small-batch importing and optimal freshness.

This revised sheet highlights the added benefit of small-batch importing, ensuring the cacao nibs are exceptionally fresh and crunchy. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/14/24, 4:55:58 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 I was thinking of the discussion we had the other day

I think for the earnings of tokens for running of live events should also indicate what the three photos you suggested to submit should look like

Otherwise, any members could just come into the channels and declare they ran a 10 hour event and claim tokens without providing anything to substantiate it
[8/14/24, 4:59:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yes, tue. I can include it in the Marketing Strategy. By today, afternoon, I can send you this first document, including the requirements for recipes videos and event images.
[8/14/24, 5:03:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yesterday I meet with @557391090002 to align the path we will walk together in the marketing team. All the tasks done, insights, will be posted here today. Something really nice is coming!
[8/14/24, 5:19:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 18 minutes this morning talking with @557391090002 and Suchitra trying to coordinate a virtual meeting with both of them, so we can become acquainted and be clear that everybody understood their assignments with no miscommunication.
[8/14/24, 5:40:06 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We shall meet on 15th august at 9:00 AM (Emelin and @557391090002) and at 18h30 (Suchitra).
[8/14/24, 7:40:42 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 4 1/2 hours doing inspection of two facilities today

One Itabuna for the production of Cacao nibs and Cacao liquor operated by Santos

The other in Ilheus for the production of Cacao liquor operated by Wesley

The first facility seems large enough to house additional machines to increase production capacity for Cacao butter

The second facility failed inspection

Will be following up with Robert once I’m done visiting the third facility in São Paulo to be organized by @14102184337 next week 

There after I’ll head to Florianopolis to visit the factory that will be producing the machines for making cacao butter that Santos is proposing for purchase ‎<This message was edited>

[8/14/24, 1:03:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Last night, I met with @557391090002 from 8:20 PM to 11:50 PM, totaling 3 hours and 30 minutes, during which we:

1. Reviewed the marketing strategy and the deliveries, the monthly content matrix, and discussed the metrics to follow for August planning.

2. Addressed the content matrix to check competencies and distribute tasks based on Matheus's delivery possibilities (time to create, edit, buy ingredients to create the recipes, send me for review and with me, help with the art content for the posts).

3. We inspected the creation studio where the reels and materials will be produced during the recordings. We checked the lighting, location, and equipment. As a request from @14153000019 and agreed by me and Matheus, all the video content and event content (photos, videos) from the community will follow some requirements established by me to be attached to the Marketing Strategy paper and after Gary's analysis, submitted and open to the DAO.
[8/14/24, 2:17:54 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002

Part of the discussion I had with @557191035605 was to iterate on the call script and to improve it over time.

Basically it is about delivering CTA in specific order to drive up the highest conversion rate possible in the sales development pipeline

CTA = call to action ‎<This message was edited>

By monday she will receive the copywriting for august (2 weeks left), and by the end of the month, she will also receive september excel sheet with the copies, time to be posted, date to be posted and the hashtags to be created also by me, using tools as Answer the Public and Google Alert. We will have our first post of the week tomorrow and then, we will follow the monthly content for these 2 weeks of august non stop.
[8/15/24, 7:51:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 17:19 talking with @557391090002 about the reels. His request was to have less reels created due the time between creation, editing and delivery. After negotiation and agreement, we are keeping the 4 reels divided (2 recipe reels and 1 agroverse and the connection with reforestation and as a community plus 1 video with the theme chosen by me) 4 HD pictures of lifestyle, farms, cocoa, ingredients, recipes processes, people interacting with the product and with the cacao).
[8/15/24, 7:52:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The sessions are recorded, the first one with @916380555310 contains one part of the talk, as the other part we were having in the marketing group.

[8/16/24, 3:07:34 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes responding to Orlantildes email via WhatsApp

The process he quoted has deviated too much from our priorly agreed upon mathematical formula for calculating prices

Depending on his response, it could be construed as him breaking trust on his side and we cancelling the entire purchase order

This is a very critical

[8/18/24, 5:07:51 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 10 minutes explaining to @557191035605 how to derive the reasonable price of organic Cacao nibs from current commodity market price

_current commodity market price = USD$7.087_

_Organic Cacao price versus commodity price = 2X_

_Conversion rate of Cacao almond to Cacao nips = 1 : 1.25_

_cost of processing of per KG Cacao almond: USD1.5_

Expected cost price of organic cacao nibs
USD$7.087 X 2 X 1.25 + USD$1.50 = *USD$19.2175* ‎<This message was edited>

[8/21/24, 3:56:08 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 

I spent time thinking through the data that has came my way on the way expenses have been incurred for our content marketing efforts 

What I have observed for the past two weeks is that all the expenses both food ingredients and transport has been incurred by @557191035605 

Regarding the accounting and disbursement of the *_R$500 monthly budget*_ that I have set aside for our content marketing efforts, instead of transferring all of them to @557391090002 on the first day of each month, the new approach will be to disburse them to the reporter (_either @557191035605 or @557391090002_) within 2 banking days via Pix as soon as the reciept for the expenses has been submitted in this channel, validated and acknowledged by me 

*Reason for the change*

- The way the budget gets disbursed becomes more accountable 

- The reporter experiences less waiting time before receiving reimbursement for expenses incurred 

- The way the expenses gets disbursed becomes more equitable to the actual person (_either @557391090002 or @557191035605_) incurring the expenses. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/21/24, 3:57:03 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes thinking through the logic of our content marketing expenses reimbursement process
[8/21/24, 4:03:10 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes poking the President of CEPOTX cooperative and thinking through our cacao financing budget allocation

My resolution is that if we do not identify another viable supplier from the *_state of Bahia*_ by end of this month, the financing budget we have allocated for purchase of cacao shipment to the USA this year will all be directed to CEPOTX based in Para 

This means bumping up our purchase of cacao from 100kg to 500kg from *_CEPOTX in Para*_ 

If we are able to find an indigenous community that produces cacao in the *_state of Amazonas*_ during this period too, we will direct part of our financing budget to the newly identified indigenous supplier.

[8/21/24, 6:31:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Video Content: keeping @557391090002 for video content, focusing on producing 3 high-quality videos (2 recipe videos and 1 on environment/farmers related to Agroverse or on Agroverse's economy model), based on @Gary Teh's expense proposal.

Design Replacement: Replace @916380555310with a skilled designer, such as Ian Sá, to handle static posts creation with me, scheduling, and other tasks, using the same budget that @916380555310 Suchitra used to only schedule and create copies for the videos. This was also base on the +9 hours time zone difference.

Marketing Management: I will be managing all aspects of marketing, including strategy development, advertising campaigns when they come, social media management, copywriting, art assistance, analysis, reporting, team coordination, and adaptation.
[8/21/24, 6:32:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I will be online for further clarification.

[8/21/24, 7:24:52 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 was notified by the kitchen I use that they are losing their lease.  Let me know if I need to search for another kitchen for packaging.
[8/21/24, 7:27:39 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, please do so. 

Or even better, figure out how to get our own kitchen certified. I know Robert who is based in Arkansa did that.

That way, we can potentially ship our own machines from China to USA to process from cacao almonds to the following derivatives

- cacao nibs
- ⁠cacao liquor/mass / aka 100% bar

I checked on Alibaba.com the machine to remove shell and convert cacao almonds to nibs is not very expensive. 
The cheapest is around USD$250 

Apart from that all we need is a roaster (_regular oven would work_)
[8/21/24, 7:28:46 AM] Val Lapidus: I have the machine that converts to liquor
[8/21/24, 7:29:05 AM] Gary Teh: Nice!

The video will require enhancements so we can post. I also told him to require the necessary equipment to film his videos because after 2 weeks of him adapting to our new marketing strategy, I will not be available to help with the filming due to my other tasks."

Its similar to the passing of laws in Legal systems. When a judge passes a judgement on a case, judges considering future cases of similar nature must then take the current case and its judgement into consideration when judging future cases. This is to ensure the legal system is consistent.

It will probably take a few days before all my videos and images are uploaded 

There are loads of them. I think more than 100GB 🤯🤣
[8/22/24, 8:59:33 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 2 minutes posting on the stories.
[8/22/24, 9:01:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: More time I spend on Instagram, I realize you actually generated great content we can reuse now and then, or posts relating to a story. The content is great, it just got lost because of the lack of organization before, balancing reels and posts to explain more what you were actually doing in your trips.
[8/22/24, 9:01:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔
[8/22/24, 9:03:08 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The content was there but the necessary preview information was not, due to the lack of titles. At some point I will organize this with @557381610166

I spent 30 minutes turning Gary's insights into visual content so we can start shaking the community through Linkedin and X as well, reaching more people to know what we do and inviting them to follow us on Instagram. The video can be used as a template and for now we have two different videos to be used as standard (font, kind of videos, images), how to use the logo, so @557391090002 can work with this to do the videos.
[8/22/24, 3:30:06 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute talking with Ian to adapt the video into a post so we can keep people who follow us informed and yet have a video to share in different platforms.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ggc7wj4hQSwrvSKTXyJE1SLjCmK2GxfX5NPLDp2MBlo/edit?usp=sharing

Will keep crawling through them until I can’t find anymore new Brazilian cacao farmers profiles and then start reaching out.
[8/23/24, 8:01:42 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes following up with Everton to find out the details of doing a triangular trade that he described last year

Where the farmer, cooperative or factory sell the Cacao to a CNPJ company that we will be setting up here in Brazil and the CNPJ company invoices the USA company

But his freighting company just picks up the Cacao from the farm corporative or factory and ship it directly to San Francisco and the CNPJ company does not have to deal with the logistic at all

That way, we only have to do FDA certification once for the CNPJ company for all future agriculture exports from Brazil into USA

[8/23/24, 10:25:29 AM] Gary Teh: I spent one hour discussing with @557191035605 about farmer sourcing and FDA FSVP requirements

*Outcome*
- find one organic cacao farmer with at least one hectare of land 
- ⁠get his CNPJ number  
- ⁠clear his farm for FDA FSVP modified exemptions for small scale farms with revenue of less than $25,000 per year ‎<This message was edited>

I spent 30 minutes extending the list with more Instagram crawl data.
[8/25/24, 4:44:06 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 30 minutes checking on Instagram account and posting stories.
[8/25/24, 4:44:50 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 2 minutes sending @14153000019 two topics to be updated on the site's page.
[8/25/24, 7:20:36 PM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: TrueTech Inc spent 6 minutes editting a spread sheet for Emelin, in order for it to be used for planning content for social media posts.
[8/26/24, 5:51:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I would like to share some perspective on the social media here. Many followers are from Brazil. Probably people who were meeting Gary along the way. I expect a reduction in Brazilians followers due to the content we started to share and english is not our second language here. Because of this, a reduction in followers is expected until we get to redirect to our target public in the US.
[8/26/24, 5:53:23 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Also, I had some research and saw that Brazilians and north Americans act different in social media. In Brazil, we tend to follow by content but also, because we considered something beautiful. We find a function for that. In the US, people prefer to follow brands they already know, that they trust, that they see as "not a scam". It is a tendency to go for the known instead of the unknown.
[8/26/24, 5:54:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because of this, the search for influencers is necessary. It will make people connect more and see themselves reflected on that person.
‎[8/26/24, 5:59:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[8/26/24, 6:00:57 AM] Emelin - Bahia: At this point, we need to reach influencers to make people in the US more comfortable with the brand. Consistency is also something that will keep us on the road. But @14153000019 what do we have to offer influencers and how was your approach with the shaman Willow?
[8/26/24, 6:02:36 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Still, it doesn't mean people will follow us, we are talking about the reach. For followers, we need to keep with the consistency of our posts and stories, using the material we already have because it will help people to see it is real, that the connection with Brazil is real, that the product is real and I aligned that posting client's pictures on the stories and also in the highlights, that is why is so important to feature them as well.
[8/26/24, 6:03:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I would like to have a meeting with you to know how your process going on Facebook has been so far in order to see how it can helps us reach the communities and groups we are interested.

[8/26/24, 6:12:02 AM] Gary Teh: Basically I offered my presence and friendship as well as the sharing of cacao when we are face to face. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/26/24, 6:15:28 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. My behavior has been to offer Free Amazonian cacao drinks at our cacao circles in USA during hippie festivals, technology events or during my personal spiritual wayfaring journey in USA.

Based on your analysis seems live meetups is still going to be leading the charge for our sales and marketing efforts

While our social media strategy remains more of a retention mechanism after the initial touch base with our brand during my wayfaring journey across USA in my car sharing our story.  🤩💪🙏
[8/26/24, 6:15:36 AM] Gary Teh: Let me know when you would like to meet?

[8/29/24, 2:21:37 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 3 hours talking with 4 producers by phone and updating the supplier list to 19 cacao producers. I am waiting response from 2 different potential suppliers who work with organic fine cacao nibs.  One from São Paulo and the other from Itajuípe, Bahia (a small group of producers but not a cooperative).
[8/29/24, 2:22:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I update the list and added some more details useful to us and I will keep updating tomorrow as I will review it again and add the location from each one I have put there.
[8/29/24, 2:29:57 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Insights: 1. the kind of relationship we had with Coopercabruca was because of @557391090002 . With producers we don't know yet, they require 50/50 payment terms and the c.n.p.j for Agroverse would be useful to show we are reliable. 2. As the prices went high, I noticed the opening to discuss these prices which is good and also shows that talking with producers as a person in first place, not a foreign company and not mentioning it is for exportation makes it easier. 3. I Those who produce their own brand tend to have the highest price on the market for their "raw" nibs. 4. And finally I realized it get less costly for us in the end of the day to deal with small producers or groups of producers (but who has a presence online, clients comments, something we can rely on), than go after cooperatives.
[8/29/24, 2:31:36 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We are dealing with high prices right now, and the fact of being organic makes it harder and more costly. If we get something a little bit under 120,00 as R$110,00 the Dao should accept it if the wish is to have a shipment this year.
[8/29/24, 2:33:21 PM] Gary Teh: Is this the price from the group of small producers in Ilheus? ‎<This message was edited>
[8/29/24, 2:33:47 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 120,00 is in Itajuípe.
[8/29/24, 2:33:58 PM] Emelin - Bahia: 100,00 in São Paulo.
[8/29/24, 2:34:09 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Bahia not Ilhéus.
[8/29/24, 2:35:22 PM] Gary Teh: Is this a farm or is this a middleman?
[8/29/24, 2:35:59 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Farm.
[8/29/24, 2:37:32 PM] Gary Teh: Could we arrange for both of them to ship a small sample of 250grams over to your place?

[8/30/24, 6:12:12 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Once more cocoa from Ilhéus/Salvador region are more costly than in other places in general. 2.He explained that the coca nibs produced by the same producer may vary in taste through the year due to temperature, light, humidity (rain) factors. He mentioned it is important to have that on the packaging, as the consumer may find it different in taste from one buy to the next.

[9/3/24, 4:49:45 AM] Gary Teh: Based on this we could ship 120 bottles of cacao molasses to the USA with a cost price of $4.1 each 

Assuming we buy the bottles directly from the Annaluana farm at R$15 per bottle 

If we could sell the bottles for usd10 we net a profit of usd6 per bottle. That would be a total profit of usd720 for the shipment  🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[9/6/24, 5:51:28 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In my point of view.
[9/6/24, 5:51:43 AM] Gary Teh: USD $75 most likely for the cost of testing ‎<This message was edited>

Now I have two cacao nibs producers on hold, because they are checking how much they can provide me in nibs. I was checking and normally the amount of the almonds is less than the amount of nibs that we can get, so I am still aiming at finding the highest quantity in organic nibs for the best price.

[9/8/24, 7:52:20 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 can we check with the farmers if they are able to issue a nota fiscal to Black King when we make a purchase of the cacao nibs 

This part is crucial so that we reduce the corporate tax of Black King to Zero when purchasing cargo passes through Black King’s accounting ledger 

This is so as to prevent @557391090002 from paying unnecessary taxes to the Brazilian government via the transaction that is happen
[9/8/24, 7:53:03 AM] Gary Teh: I spent five minutes, thinking through the end to end accounting of the transaction

[9/8/24, 7:55:06 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 which country has a lower corporate taxation 

USA or Brazil 

If we are a Multinational entity which does import of cacao from Brazil to USA , under which country do you suggest we book our profits on the accounting books for submission to government for taxation purposes?
[9/8/24, 7:55:08 AM] Meta AI: The country with a lower corporate taxation rate between the USA and Brazil is the USA. As of 2022, the USA has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, while Brazil has a federal corporate tax rate of 34% (25% federal tax + 9% social contribution tax).

Regarding your question about where to book profits for taxation purposes, it's a complex issue that depends on various factors, such as the entity's structure, tax residency, and transfer pricing regulations. However, I can provide some general guidance:

- If your multinational entity is a US taxpayer, it's generally beneficial to book profits in the USA, taking advantage of the lower tax rate.
- However, you must ensure compliance with US transfer pricing rules, arm's length principles, and Brazilian tax regulations.
- Consider consulting a tax professional or expert in international taxation to ensure compliance and optimize your tax strategy.

Please note that tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and this response is not a substitute for professional tax advice. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/9/24, 12:07:35 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 I just checked through @16468233438 requirements for TyTycoco

Seems He only needs 50Kg for this year. I am checking if he wants it converted to cacao liquor instead of just nibs 

Since CIC does have the facility to do that. 

So in total we only need to source for 500kg of cacao almonds. Which converts to


- Shena: 300 kg of cacao nibs 

- ⁠@16468233438 : 50 kg of cacao nibs (or liquor)

- ⁠our own requirements : 50 kg of cacao nibs

I will be having a call on @16468233438 on Wednesday to check if he would like his supply in cacao liquor instead of Cacao nibs, since he is right now processing his nibs into liquor over in California anyways.

[9/9/24, 12:43:15 PM] Gary Teh: Just received quotation from Ewerton on freighting 300kg of cacao nibs from Bahia facility to Austin Texas airport.

I spent 5 minutes following up with him

Shipping cost is around: USD$6.2312695 / KG

Price does not include customs clearance for Brazilian side

Customs clearance on Brazilian side is additional R$1000. Additional USD$0.597445333333333 / kg

Current net excluding USA customs clearance is $6.828714833333333 / kg

If we assume custom clearance on USA side will cost the usual $500, it will be an additional $1.66 / kg

Final cost per kg will be $8.4953815 / kg ‎<This message was edited>

[9/10/24, 4:56:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will ask them if we will always need to classify the almond as weather and humidity can alter the final product, remembering we are using organic cacao, and so the final product can change.
[9/10/24, 5:04:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: For next purchases, once again we should talk with the suppliers with more time, ask their harvesting periods in the year (I will ask one of them today) so we can reduce this cost. If we had all the almonds from the same batch and farmer, it would cost only USD 17,90. If we take the cacao almonds from two farmers, but from the same batch, it would cost  only USD35,89.
[9/10/24, 5:06:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So we are paying 53,71 because one of them didn't have more cacao to provide, what made us take 200kg from the same farmer but from different batches. @14153000019 more farmers we work with, more cost we will have with the almonds' test.

Do you think you can cover me for this week?
[9/12/24, 6:12:13 AM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: Ok, I'll take care of the tasks,

[9/12/24, 6:13:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We can meet at lunchtime halfway of your house. I need to buy some stuff.
[9/12/24, 6:15:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I want to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 6:20:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.

[9/12/24, 2:41:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 4 minutes talking with Carla, our ther supplier, about their possibility to test themselves the next batch.

[9/12/24, 2:42:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So basically, I will be waiting Carla's answers and two tests until the end of this month.
[9/12/24, 2:42:34 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I haven't be able to call the freight companies due to my work and these processes in the negotiations.
[9/12/24, 2:42:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Hopefully tomorrow I can call them during the morning as top priority.

- TrueSight DAO community members will secure freight forwarding company services to ship the 300kg of loose unpackaged organic cacao nibs from the processing facility to Austin, Texas Airport for receipt by you.
- TrueTech Inc. will provide FDA FSVP compliance to ensure the 300kg of loose unpackaged organic cacao nibs meet FDA requirements for sale and distribution within the USA.
- TrueTech Inc. will consolidate and pre-finance the costs for the shipment beyond the $1,500 payment provided by you.

- TrueTech Inc. will update AGL4 to track and make visible all costs incurred during the entire process.
- Reimbursement for all costs incurred should be made via Venmo to @garyjob.


Dispute Resolution:


In the event of any dispute arising from this agreement, both parties agree to seek resolution through amicable negotiations. However, if such disputes cannot be resolved amicably, both parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware, where TrueTech Inc. is incorporated.

- ⁠75kg of cacao shells for Shena

*Our own requirements: to San Francisco California*
- ⁠10kg cacao nibs packed in 225gram Kraft pouch bags for ourselves = 44 bags

- ⁠10kg of 80gram cacao liquor bars for ourselves = 125 bars

- ⁠5kg of cacao shells for ourselves

[9/18/24, 6:13:25 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 could you have Annaluana ship 15 bottles of cacao molasses to your house for r$15 each?

Thanks. 🤩🙏

Let me know what her Pix is and I could pay her directly

[9/18/24, 6:56:22 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎This message was deleted.
[9/18/24, 8:22:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute talking with Jéssica CIC. We can store our nibs there until we solve all other parts of the process. If they need to clear the space, she will inform me.
[9/18/24, 8:31:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 2 minutes with Jéssica, CIC, reinforcing the information of the final product we expect from the bacthes that will arrive, the quantities of the products and the separation in grams and kgs described as @14153000019 sent me and tagged me here.
[9/18/24, 8:46:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute checking the following information (Jéssica, CIC):  1. About the packaging conditions and price (answered). 2. About the type of packaging (not answered yet). Jéssica mentioned they don't have packages for that. The process is, we buy the packages and for the service of packaging we pay 0,35 cents (USD 0,064 - USD 6,4 cents). The packaging service is for package, not for weight, so a small one or a big one will cost USD 0,064 cents @14153000019

[9/18/24, 8:49:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Any questions?

[9/18/24, 9:19:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will wait Jéssica and check this info. @557391090002 can you ask Orlantildes the best material to store and ship the nibs, the powder and the liquor? Once you have this info, I will check for the material, quantities and come out with the cost @14153000019.
[9/18/24, 9:21:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @557391090002 remember Gary told him he would buy cacao only next year. So the right way to ask this is to ask for the material. "For knowledge matter", once he gives you this info, you can also ask him where they buy this. As they buy in quantities, they need to check the best price as well.

[9/18/24, 11:54:19 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: The most complicated product is the nibs because it oxidizes. So ideally, it should be stored in vacuum-sealed packaging and kept away from light. As soon as it's produced, it should be stored in a vacuum-sealed bag in a dark environment.

As for cacao powder, simple packaging is sufficient.

For the liquor, it’s important to have it in sealed packaging.

In all cases, it's important to maintain a room temperature of up to 30°C.

@557391090002 can you help source for one that can hold the 10kg of cacao liquor and still fit into the 100cm x 50cm x 50cm box along with all the rest of the items in the 30kg package that we want to ship over to San Francisco USA?

[9/20/24, 5:13:54 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 for our own shipment, let’s just package all our cacao nibs into our Kraft pouches 🙂🙏
[9/20/24, 6:39:20 AM] Emelin - Bahia: *Important information below*
[9/20/24, 6:53:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1.	Fernardo (our first supplier) didn't pass the test (humity too high and fermentation lower but still out of what we need for the quality we are searching for. The limit is 5.2). I spent 5 minutes talking with Jéssica. The official report is not available yet, so we received that as information as I requested. We will still receive the official report.

2.	Based on this, I spent 25 minutes talking with Carlos arranging the quantity and the logistics. About the quantity: with the previous information on Fernando’s test we went low on -100kg available. Talking with Carlos, I could reach to 270kg of Carlo’s almonds to surpress our deficit with Fernando. We won’t have 400kg total, instead we’ll have 370 kg. 100kg almonds from Fernando and 270kg from Oscar. 

3.	On the logistics: I was informed that 24th-25th September, we would have 150kg from Oscar in 24th – 25th September and then, in the second week of october, we would have more 120kg, totallizing 270kg from him. My suggestion is to wait until the second week of October, around 7th-9th to take the almonds in Oscar’s farm. 

4.	About Oscar’s almonds test: the test will be made this month yet. As they will come from the same batch, we only need to test once. So when we go to Oscar’s farm, second week of October, we will take the entire amount, 270kg and deliver to CIC for processing. 

5.	As we deal with nature’s will, if the weather gets this stable, the dates confirms. If it rains it may vary.
[9/20/24, 6:55:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 we need to rethink the amounts you sent me based on 370kg instead of 400kg.
[9/20/24, 6:55:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So I can send to Jéssica through e-mail.
[9/20/24, 6:55:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will be absent for now to call the logistics companies.
[9/20/24, 6:55:32 AM] Gary Teh: Thank you for your contribution to our mission! Please do remember to submit your time spent. 🙂🙏
[9/20/24, 6:56:15 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just focus on fulfilling Shena’s requirements for 300kg cacao nibs for now.
[9/20/24, 6:59:13 AM] Emelin - Bahia: About the pictures required from Gary: 1- fermentation (delivered), drying (delivered), harvesting (now Carlos is harvesting only bulk so he will try to send me the harvesting of fine cacao (manual harvest) as soon as he gets it. @14153000019 can you remind me the other picture you need?
[9/20/24, 6:59:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute sending Black King c.n.p.j information to Oscar.
[9/20/24, 7:00:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 2 minutes giving Fernando's feedback on the test and telling him we will not proceed buying cacao from them.
[9/20/24, 7:02:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So now @557391090002 @14153000019 we have tasks pending regarding to the nibs and shippment. @557391090002 I need information on the bag material we will use to storage Shena's nibs *asap*. Give Orlantildes a call and ask him directly by phone. It is faster. Also try to get his supplier for this material.  I will call the companies Gary's sent me and getting their prices.

[9/20/24, 12:16:05 PM] Emelin - Bahia: For the record, I am talking with Glaucy, from Action Cargo. They work with the whole logistics chain. I have some insights on our shipment from her: we will need to ship in two pallets as the companies only handle 200kg per pallet. She recommended a plastic one, because if we use wood made pallets we'll have a cost over the fumigation (an obligatory procedure when using wooden pallets). I am waiting for her answer on the type of material (sacas material) that we an use @557391090002. Keep doing your research because it would be easier to take these sacas when the 370kg of almonds processed by CIC is ready. We give it to them.
[9/20/24, 12:35:30 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 and @557191035605 

TrueTech Inc is the official importer of the 300kg of cacao nibs on file 

Shena is just collecting from the airport after the cargo has cleared customs
[9/20/24, 12:35:38 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes clarifying this
[9/20/24, 2:04:03 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 

Since @557191035605 informed that we won’t be shipping the 20kg cacao nibs for our own requirements for San Francisco let’s go ahead with the following experiment 

Could we request to annaluana to top up total number of cacao molasses to 20 bottles instead of just 15 bottles.

Once we have the 20 bottles ready can we bring them to the local post office in downtown Ilheus and have them shipped over to @16468233438 warehouse location in San Francisco 

TrueTech Inc
3041 Taraval St
San Francisco
California 94116
United States 

- I am expecting the whole shipment to be slightly more than 5kg

- ⁠I am expecting each bottle to cost R$15

- ⁠I am expecting to pay the farmers directly via pix 

- ⁠I am expecting that the farmer issue Black King an invoice 

- ⁠let me know exactly how much the post office charges you for posting the package to @16468233438 warehouse. Send me a copy of the reciept and i will immediately reimburse you when i get it 

- ⁠I am expecting black king to issue TrueTech Inc an invoice for the 20 bottles of cacao molasses for the payment I made to annaluana via Pix

- ⁠when shipping the shipment over via the post office indicate sender as black king using black king CNPJ

[9/21/24, 6:10:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 hour and 49 minutes creating a reels for our Instagram page, commenting on an Instagram account related to healthy food with many views and in Willow Star account. I also went through Freepik videos database to find good quality videos.
[9/21/24, 6:10:52 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute confirming with Gary about weather now in CA.

[9/22/24, 1:44:58 PM] Gary Teh: Seems pricing of navitas our largest competitor in the USA has bumped up their pricing for 8 ounce cacao nibs from $10 to $13.50

Perhaps it’s time for us to do the same 

I spent 15 minutes doing market research

[9/22/24, 4:21:23 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 10 minutes checking Instagram reports. I confirmed that even using VPN, Instagram is still suggesting people that live in Brazil as it reads a pattern of our followers, it is still a response of the number of Brazilians we had due to the content generated in Brazil and the connections established here in Gary's travel. It also influenced the posting time generated on Instagram as it shows the time of our Brazilian followers as they are many. The decision is to abandon this time suggestion. So for Brazil, the videos and images must be published around 14:00 and 16:00 as it would be 10:00 am and 12:00 pm in the US.
[9/22/24, 4:24:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 10 minutes searching for a different excel sheet model for Social Media as it is more automated and helps to know what has been published already or not, if it was reels, feed or stories, together with the content, date, etc.
[9/22/24, 4:28:39 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will be using my time to get logistics quotations, organizing at maximum Social Media (jumping on Facebook as well and in groups, leaving Linkedin for now as it only allow us to follow another companies) and fixing our necessity of almonds supply.
[9/22/24, 4:31:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 is working on his second proposal of the package for the new product, and I have been giving feedback to help him adjust. Once finish I would like to do an A/B test with the fellows from the US. @14153000019 do you have any time to help with that? So we can be more assertive before just putting in the market.
[9/22/24, 4:31:21 PM] Val Lapidus: Can I get more information on the cacao molasses that is being sent to me?  Id like to buy some to make beer with.  What is the sugar content?
[9/22/24, 4:31:30 PM] Gary Teh: How would you like help?
[9/22/24, 4:36:14 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I need to contact people from the USA. As these tests tend to get many people, how many people do you think you are able to connect me with for this?
[9/22/24, 4:37:16 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 is right now in the USA 

He is your go to person for this

I am quite useless in this department at the moment as I am in Brazil ‎<This message was edited>

[9/22/24, 4:41:15 PM] Val Lapidus: The nutrition facts are very blurry
[9/22/24, 4:41:31 PM] Val Lapidus: Any idea how much sugar for what serving size?

[9/22/24, 4:46:47 PM] Gary Teh: That is not cacao molasses you sent to @16468233438

[9/22/24, 4:48:38 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is easier to missunderstand as it is not common for us to use cacao molasses. 😂
[9/22/24, 4:48:53 PM] Emelin - Bahia: We grow up using only sugar cane molasses.
[9/22/24, 4:49:54 PM] Gary Teh: For example about of sugar in one serving 

Measure how many grams is one tea spoon of honey 

And then use the following formula 

28grams of sugar / 100grams cacao molasses X weight of honey in a tea spoon
[9/22/24, 4:49:56 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Culturally inserted here is cacao jam and sugar cane molasses.
[9/22/24, 4:50:36 PM] Val Lapidus: Can someone explain what cacao honey is?
[9/22/24, 4:51:09 PM] Gary Teh: Cacao honey is the unprocessed juice squeezed out of the fruit pulp of the cacao fruit
[9/22/24, 4:51:33 PM] Val Lapidus: Nothing to do with honey
[9/22/24, 4:51:35 PM] Val Lapidus: Then
[9/22/24, 4:51:37 PM] Val Lapidus: Ok
[9/22/24, 4:52:10 PM] Gary Teh: Just translate it to fresh Cacao fruit juice for the folks in California ‎<This message was edited>
[9/22/24, 4:55:07 PM] Val Lapidus: So I translated the picture you sent for the sugar content of the molasses.  It's 100 g and out of those 100 g 94 g is sugar content.  Am I reading that correctly that it's mainly sugar?  Meaning that you took 8 l of cacao juice.  And then 4 kilos of sugar and reduced it down to 4 l. Reducing it by a 1/3?
[9/22/24, 4:55:20 PM] Val Lapidus: Am I understanding that correctly?
[9/22/24, 4:55:40 PM] Gary Teh: Ignore the image sent by @557191035605
[9/22/24, 4:56:10 PM] Gary Teh: 28grams of sugar for every 100grams

[9/22/24, 5:00:09 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 bump up our shipment of cacao molasses to 30 bottles 

@16468233438 just placed an order for 10 bottles for his personal usage on the side
[9/22/24, 5:02:03 PM] Gary Teh: Just received USD100 from @16468233438 for the upcoming AGL5 shipment

[9/22/24, 7:08:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 30 minutes organizing the sheet with the content and 6 minutes giving @557391090002 and @14153000019 directions on how to use it.

It doesn’t make sense to spend more money than we can make from the shipment

If total profit we can generate from the extra 10 bottles is USD40, it doesn’t make sense to spend close to 50% on fuel cost 

We might as well just do nothing if that’s the case ‎<This message was edited>

[9/23/24, 6:02:59 PM] Gary Teh: *Reflections for the evening*

to run a successful
Logistics operations, we need to run a tight ship

Every time we incur unnecessary expenses, we are eating away at our profit margin

A huge part of the reason why I am opting to stay in Itacare right now in a hostel and cooking every meal 

- Hostel cost per night: USD$6

- ⁠Cost per self cooked meal: USD$4

- ⁠two meals a day

- ⁠daily expenses: under USD$20

Or when back in USA living in the car, with the specific goal of totally removing the rent component from my monthly expenses 

_PS: just to give an example, when I was back in Singapore in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis, starting my own technology consulting business, I opted to walk for 13 hours from one end of the island back home after receiving $120 from the payment of an assignment after the train service was totally out instead of wasting $30 just to get to get home in a taxi._

_That is how tight I watch the expense budget_

_as Jerry (DAO member) says sometimes just right before we go into one of our war rooms in Edmodo (for the 16 hour days marathon), honey moon period is over. It’s crunch time_ 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[9/24/24, 4:35:03 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We have a lot going on, and creating one more rule to remember will increase cognitive load. As it was the first time to happen, it leads me to understand it worked to separate as topics before. In my opinion, we move on from that and focus on the attention matter. I asked him to confirm because it was not clear for me as well. 🙏🏽✅
[9/24/24, 4:35:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thanks for clarifying the matter @14153000019

[9/24/24, 4:38:07 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute answering Glaucy, Action Cargo (logistic company) who informed me the quotation may arrive today. As soon as I receive it, I post it here.

[9/24/24, 5:50:51 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 20 minutes talking with @557391090002 about Friday's almonds delivery, about the blending (it is recommendable for me and him to be present during the blending so we can indicate them the amount we want to blend, and we will have a better idea when we have the answer about the bags and the quantity to go in every bag as well. He went to Uesc to check the nibs from Carla and Fernando's and it has a neuter taste which can be blended as expected.

[9/24/24, 6:58:23 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent two minutes answering Jéssica, CIC, and getting some of the numbers required for CIC (fermentation, defects, humidity levels).
[9/24/24, 6:58:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute sending the numbers from CIC to Oscar, the supplier.
[9/24/24, 6:59:42 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute asking Matheus to explain the microbiologic test and metals test to @14153000019 as I am busy today.

[9/24/24, 7:02:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We will have the exactly numbers once we receive the final result from Carla's and Fernando's. They haven't sent yet.
[9/24/24, 7:02:16 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: I spent 5 hours getting the extra bottles in Itabuna and visiting the CIC and checking the nibs and taking the bottles for shipping in FeDex. ‎<This message was edited>

[9/24/24, 1:51:18 PM] Gary Teh: It’s already been shipped via FedEx this morning 

Will arrive earlier than expected
[9/24/24, 1:51:36 PM] Val Lapidus: Wow
[9/24/24, 1:51:45 PM] Val Lapidus: Can I have tracking?

[9/24/24, 1:52:57 PM] Gary Teh: Should arrive by end of the month 

Future prices to retail customers is $12 

Local postal service does not handle liquid 

So our net cost per bottle is $9.10
[9/24/24, 1:54:58 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Hey @16468233438 Actually I dropped off on FeDex but I'm finishing the documents and It will leave next flight. So we are fixing some details and soon they send me I'll send to you the tracking number

[9/24/24, 5:44:51 PM] Gary Teh: That is very strange 🤔
[9/24/24, 5:49:56 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 30 minutes checking on Brazilian communities in the US. Easier than convince someone from another culture how good is to eat cacao nibs and melaço, is trying to sell to those people who already know that and live in communities (always exchanging information and very social). Based on that, I will follow Brazilians who live in California on Instagram and interact with them, meanwhile @557381610166 will sneak into the communities in Facebook.
[9/24/24, 5:51:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 it is better if you get undercover, because as far as I have seen, many of them have this topic about not accepting companies, only individuals. I sent a message through the marketing group here in Whatsapp on how to proceed. Any questions, you can ask me.
[9/24/24, 5:56:07 PM] Gary Teh: @557381610166 you are also an administrator of the Facebook page could you sit with @557191035605 and figure out how to sort it out 🙂🙏
[9/24/24, 5:59:15 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 15 minutes writing on the marketing group about the step-by-step introduction in the Brazilian communities in the US (mainly San Francisco, CA). But as there will always be a happy foreigner husband willing to buy his Brazilian lady some Brazilian treats, they will buy if they like from wherever the community in the US is,
[9/25/24, 6:02:00 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 what is the status of the FedEx shipping?

[9/25/24, 3:50:08 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 40 minutes checking latinos in the US communities on Facebook, sent some messages to individuals and posted in a group as well. @557381610166 time to put your spanish back to use as well.
[9/25/24, 3:54:21 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The more I think, see, and reflect, I realize that we should consider having contacts with the Latino community in the US, as well attending to events. We know how life is here, we have a different view of tourists or foreigners when they come here, we know our problems as Latino American people, we understand about Amazon, we feel the pressure of the big companies on single every country of our continent, and we grew up eating healthy food, so we don't need to be convinced that the Agroverse cause is good and that organic food is good because we grew up hearing this and eating healhty.
[9/25/24, 3:55:41 PM] Emelin - Bahia: It is a challenge for the north Americans folks and even for @14153000019, due to the barrier language you may encounter and the culture, but it is actually a good way to get into the community. Latino people create a big community wherever they go and they also like Brazil.
[9/25/24, 3:56:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Meanwhile we get to the north american people to understand what we do and understand that eating good is actually nice to their bodies we have a whole community that already understand this.
[9/25/24, 3:56:51 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Cacao is not new for us either.
[9/25/24, 3:58:13 PM] Emelin - Bahia: What I can do from here is to connect with Latinos (as both Ian and I speak fluent spanish), try to reach the Brazilian community and then think how we can get to these Latino or Brazilian events there.
[9/25/24, 4:24:04 PM] Gary Teh: That will be very cool! 😎🙏
[9/25/24, 4:24:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 20 minutes checking Brazilian group in the US, (got accepted), writing to Brazilians and found a Latino Bakery.

[9/26/24, 12:19:54 PM] Gary Teh: That is the problem when doing content marketing on platforms that we don’t own - Instagram

I would propose we start shifting our content marketing efforts to be more centered around our own website
[9/26/24, 12:20:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Facebook is alive.
[9/26/24, 12:20:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If we use our site for that, we should consider google ads.
[9/26/24, 12:21:20 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Everything posted in Facebook is there.
[9/26/24, 12:22:13 PM] Gary Teh: We should focus on SEO and generating good content targeted at specific keywords 

Otherwise all the money we spend out efforts making including risking our life’s (like that near death experience we had with that car accident) just ends up in Google’s pocket
[9/26/24, 12:23:22 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 this weekend, save as much content as you can into Google's drive because it is all Meta in the end of the day.
[9/26/24, 12:24:03 PM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: Ok, gonna get the content from the FB timeline.
[9/26/24, 12:24:07 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I will wait for Instagram's response on the appealing and then redirecting the efforts. Meanwhile @557381610166 and @557391090002 it goes what we talked about with the communities.
[9/26/24, 12:24:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Brazilian community, latino community. For every post we are going to miss posting on Instagram, we need to use the groups and make contacts.
[9/26/24, 12:26:15 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I am using my personal one to get into the communities, @557381610166 you can do the same because it is easier to get accepted as an individual in this communities, @557391090002 keep generating videos as we have Facebook to go legit if someone wonder.

[9/26/24, 11:59:03 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I would give a thought on the concept of community, consider sell the concept of the project in order to get people who understand that talking, sharing, liking, is connecting, is make other people get the information we are trying to give.

From my perspective we need to organize our own house and realizing the benefits of having it clean.

I say we need, not @14153000019  needs.   So yes, if we don't change the approach and get more people involved in the US in the project to build the community we say we are, we may be broke. 🙏🏾 It is an USA issue although. The Brazilian side has been creating, sharing, making connections, trying to find suppliers, checking logistics, etc.
[9/27/24, 12:48:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So I would love to hear from the ones in the US how we can deal with this.
[9/27/24, 4:45:07 AM] Gary Teh: We need to conduct more cacao circles in the USA 

Feels like it is time I head back to the USA soon 

I already skipped the cacao circle in Oregon on 17th Sept 

There is another one happening on the 13th Oct
[9/27/24, 4:47:36 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 let me know if you will be able to handle all the matters regarding sourcing and freighting of the 300kg of cacao nibs to Shena in Austin Texas by middle of next month and if there is anything else you need from me here 

If all is good then I should start heading back to the USA sooner rather than later ‎<This message was edited>

[9/27/24, 6:13:36 AM] Gary Teh: Just finished my morning meditation session

Had a flash of insight regarding our social media content marketing efforts 

The word is *_Shareability*_.

We need to start looking back to the contents that we have created so far to analyze which ones did people reasonate with that they naturally want to share.

We need to double down by focusing our efforts and limited resources on creating more of those that people inherently feel like sharing and cut the creation of content that when people look at they don’t naturally feel like sharing ‎<This message was edited>

[9/27/24, 8:20:50 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 

I spoken with @557191035605 we agree that you should oversee the logistics for shipping out the 300kg cacao nibs to Shena

As you have demonstrated utmost ability in handling this task during the shipping of 30 bottles of cacao molasses to UsA ‎<This message was edited>
[9/27/24, 8:31:50 AM] Gary Teh: Me and @557191035605 spent 2 hours discussion on alignment and priortization 

*_Outcome of discussion*_ 

- primary target market for USA - cacao shamans 

- ⁠acquisition channel - I go attend cacao ceremonies in west coast of USA to do more outreach with them

- ⁠Instagram content marketing: content to show that we are legitimately connected with the farmers 

- ⁠Instagram content marketing: the different steps in the process of how cacao liquors are created

- ⁠Instagram content marketing: how to use the cacao 

- ⁠@557391090002 will oversee all parts of the process from collection of farms to processing in CIC or at Martinus chocolate to shipping it out of USA 

- ⁠@557191035605 will continue with building relationships with farmers and getting the prices and quantities whenever we have requirements

- ⁠once @557391090002 confirms he can handle the logistics of getting the cacao from the farms all the way to shipping I will start planning for my journey back to USA to start with our go to market strategy execution ‎<This message was edited>

[9/27/24, 9:10:31 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 for the new lady supplier that reached out with cacao selling at R$88

Ask how much supply she has 

If she has more than 30kg cacao almonds I am thinking of getting another 30kg for Agroverse needs 

These we will convert into liquor using Martinus chocolates facility

@557391090002 do reach out to Martinus chocolate to discuss about using their help to convert cacao almonds into chocolate liquor bars 

https://maps.app.goo.gl/4LQ7PXGhtN2GpYGy8?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

Last time I was there with Orlantildes Martinus mention they can do the conversion for $6 per kg ‎<This message was edited>

[9/27/24, 10:40:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 18 minutes talking with Oscar. He came over to my place and left me some almonds.
[9/27/24, 10:41:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: He told me he can fix 300kg until 15th october.
[9/27/24, 10:41:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will hold 30kg almonds from a supplier I spent 25 minutes talking.
[9/27/24, 10:42:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 1. Suppliers: Carla and Fernando (100kg)  2. Oscar (fixing our 300kg until october) 3. Ronaldo (farm Estrela Guia): fixing 30kg
[9/27/24, 10:43:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I consider it is important to fix the 30kg because Oscar will be talking to me and checking if he can deliver the 300kg.
[9/27/24, 10:44:37 AM] Gary Teh: *Possibility A*
If Oscar cannot provide, and we have to 30 KG from Ronaldo as back up

*Possibility B*
If Oscar can provide, then we buy the 30 KG from Ronaldo process it into cacao liquor via Martinus Chocolate and ship it to San Francisco ‎<This message was edited>
‎[9/27/24, 10:44:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[9/27/24, 10:45:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I think Ronaldo will probably sell to another person, because Oscar's deadline changed to 15th october to have 300kg.
[9/27/24, 10:46:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I would go with possibility B.
[9/27/24, 10:46:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I sense this amounts are somehow an approach when it is late in the season.
[9/27/24, 10:46:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: When it comes to larger amounts.
[9/27/24, 10:46:35 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s do that
[9/27/24, 10:47:07 AM] Gary Teh: So it’s mainly a problem of storage 

@557391090002 how big is your storage facility in Ilheus?
[9/27/24, 10:47:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: You can share here and in Matheus' place.
[9/27/24, 10:48:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Anyway.
[9/27/24, 10:49:40 AM] Gary Teh: *An idea*

When the farmers start dropping their prices as it gets late into the harvesting and selling season, this might be an opportunity to start stockpiling cacao almonds at the cheaper rates they are offering and storing them in Ilheus 

That way when we start having demand from USA (_or elsewhere_) in the future we can draw down from that stock pile we built up in Ilheus convert then to nibs or liquor and then ship them out

Cacao almonds could probably keep for 1 year ‎<This message was edited>
[9/27/24, 10:53:00 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 when you get the chance send me photos of your storage facility in Ilheus as well as its location I need to setup FDA FSVP compliance document for that as well

Hope you hand and your dog is recovering 🙂🙏
[9/27/24, 10:57:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: When the prices are low it means they also have small amounts. It means we will work with blends. Is the idea to change everything to blends?
[9/27/24, 11:26:25 AM] Gary Teh: The ideas to let the buyer know which farms the Cacao come from

Shena already knows her cacao are coming from 2 farms right now and then maybe a 3rd

Right now we haven’t really advertise single source origin in our marketing messages ‎<This message was edited>
[9/27/24, 11:32:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We need to check other shamans expectations. If they don't care about blending, perfect. If what we discussed earlier is correct, we may be changing from nibs to bars.
[9/27/24, 11:32:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @557391090002 I think it is interesting to check with the logistics companies about refrigeration necessities in costs for bars.
[9/27/24, 11:45:57 AM] Gary Teh: When I checked with the shaman Willow, they just ship it over to her place using regular mail

So long as it’s sealed and doesn’t leak, it’s generally ok. 🤔
[9/27/24, 11:54:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Jéssica CIC answered differently. That is why it is important to check the best way to preserve the product.
[9/27/24, 7:06:42 PM] Gary Teh: Current statistics

- cost per click: $0.52
- ⁠total site visits: 2
- ⁠total impressions: 52
- ⁠total spend: $1.12

Target for profitability: every 4 clicks need to drive at least sale of 1 bag of cacao nibs otherwise we are just making losses running ads

I spent 1 hour conducting this experiment ‎<This message was edited>

However if targeted at cacao shaman’s whose expected net profit to date ranges from between USD8 to USD2000

[9/28/24, 7:31:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Here in Brazil when people run adds they make the reels towards selling, telling how they can solve the viewers problem. It is different than just boosting a reels. Or they have a copy invting to know their product and their site.
[9/28/24, 7:31:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Inviting*
[9/28/24, 7:32:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And the adds have also a/b test and a time to see which  approach works better on the public.
[9/28/24, 7:33:20 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The same money you are using, you could be testing the reach of adds with shamans, with a copywrinting and approach to them.
[9/28/24, 7:33:44 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔 feels like we are loosing an opportunity and money here 😂
[9/28/24, 7:34:02 AM] Gary Teh: There are a few parts to the testing

- determine cost per click 
- ⁠determine conversion from site visit to sales after click through for traditional sales funnel 
- ⁠determine click through to follow if employing content marketing
[9/28/24, 7:34:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Before running adds be sure to adapt them to your needs, and be sure the content is aligned to the actions you want people to take.
[9/28/24, 7:34:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🙏🏾
[9/28/24, 7:35:52 AM] Gary Teh: That is true. I spent a total of $1.50 just to have to run a quick blitz to get a sense of how the channel will behave before further deploying more resource to optimizing it

[9/28/24, 7:53:47 AM] Gary Teh: This is what I would propose as a growth hack experiment 

After we have spoken to the 7/8 shamans identified in our list, create an Instagram specifically target at their needs or whatever reasonates with them 

Set a USD50 budget aside to run the Instagram experiment at profiles similar to the following 

- https://www.instagram.com/sangarasoraya?igsh=MW10emRhMzdsODZvOQ==
- ⁠https://www.instagram.com/meetwillowstar?igsh=MTE2YWhrMTFicGox

The goal is to test how many more followers of our target demographic we can gain on our Instagram account
[9/28/24, 7:55:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Out of 0 followers? People also follow pages that looks legit.
[9/28/24, 7:55:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🤔
[9/28/24, 7:56:03 AM] Gary Teh: What does out of 0 followers mean?
[9/28/24, 7:56:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: A new page.
[9/28/24, 7:56:55 AM] Emelin - Bahia: With no followers yet.
[9/28/24, 7:58:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So, we ask the shamans to follow the page, so it helps showing the page is new, but the folllowes found it interesting.
[9/28/24, 7:58:36 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Social proof.
[9/28/24, 7:58:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: 🙏🏾
[9/28/24, 8:03:31 AM] Gary Teh: 🤔

And then shutdown the page after running the experiment?
[9/28/24, 10:48:42 AM] Gary Teh: Let’s just do a quick blitz into the Facebook USA brazilian group to determine if the hypothesis reasonate

Shaman experiment: I can create content that can also be used in our site, by creating some texts longer and summarazing them for social media. Outcome A) we start attracting more shamans around the US and  now we'll have 2 accounts. I can make a post redirecting them to Agroverse instead. Outcome B) It does work and meanwhile you are in the US field exploring, you can direct these shamans to this experiment account, where they have content which resonates with them. The account grows, we keep it. It may end up growing more and more and if this is the case, we shut down Agroverse's current account.
[9/28/24, 11:58:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Now you see this will require some time to be built, meanwhile Agroverse's account can't be shut down.
[9/28/24, 11:59:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: If we go with the shamans, we focus on that experiment first, it is my suggestion.
[9/28/24, 12:00:50 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Not spreading, using our resources to maintain Agroverse with 2 posts per week, avoiding shirtless videos, but more history content (cacao-Ilhéus-Brazil) and controversial posts.
[9/28/24, 12:02:45 PM] Emelin - Bahia: If the shaman experiment goes wrong, we have reduced the content, 1 video recipe, 1 history/ about us in the current action of this period of Ilhéus and region history, and it will serve for brazilians outside, shamans who like to know more about the history and where the cacao comes from.
[9/28/24, 12:03:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The idea is to not lose content, reducing in Agroverse to add in Shaman's experiment.
[9/28/24, 12:06:28 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 you must follow this discussion as well.
[9/28/24, 3:02:19 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes giving feedback to @557191035605 on the process to follow when running growth (_hacking_) experiments

[9/28/24, 4:06:15 PM] Gary Teh: Just to ensure we follow fiscal discipline 

The month where the $50 is set aside for running ads means the month where we do not set aside any funds for content marketing. Aka content marketing budget gets cut to $0

Embrace and transcend the constrain. 🤩🙏
[9/28/24, 5:58:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Agroverse still needs to keep going and the search into brazilian groups. You mean the shaman page, right?
[9/28/24, 6:03:07 PM] Gary Teh: You want to run two experiments concurrently? 🤯
[9/28/24, 6:47:32 PM] Gary Teh: Just when we think we have a working model, Eric Schmidt (_Google’s Ex-CEO_) advises to focus on further refining the model to boost the model’s expected growth rate by an increased order of magnitude

The accounts reached and accounts engaged numbers are down very badly versus the baseline numbers of 25th August 

Are you sure you can deliver on the OKR numbers that you promised in your proposal by the 16th Nov?

Think about and propose what can be done differently to hit the numbers. It doesn’t feel like more of the same stuff will work. As it already shows clearly it’s not working.

Just so you know this is being published to across all our DAO channels so DAO members are monitoring this and it will affect our TDG trading price and also affect the continued availability of content marketing budget beyond 16th Nov ‎<This message was edited>
[9/29/24, 5:47:41 AM] Gary Teh: *Reflections on this*

We should reframe and start thinking of our online activities as _Performance Marketing_ instead of _Content Marketing_. This shifts the focus from just churning out content to fill the slots to focus on performant content that actually drives conversion down the marketing funnel

Something that worked really well when I was overseeing that portion of the funnel with @916380555310 help was utilizing the collaboration feature

It also involves a social hack component. By befriending influencers in person and then creating reels featuring them. Then inviting them as collaborators 

Even right it’s working very very well for my personal Instagram account which is already up another 47.4% over the past 30 days

[9/29/24, 6:07:25 AM] Gary Teh: *General high level advise from Gary V*

- social media platforms (_especially Meta_) often roll out new features to their users after much behavioral research of their users

- ⁠these new features are often underutilized by brands 

- ⁠until the mainstream endumberent brands catch up and start exploiting these features for their own conversion rate, there is small window where we can squeeze a lot of eyeballs for ourselves *_Performance Marketing*_ wise for ourselves  

_PS: constantly seeking out these new gaps and the exploiting them was how we conducted *Performance Marketing* (growth hacking) to boost our user base back in Edmodo from 10 million users to more than 100 million registered users before we sold it off for USD$300 million_

[9/29/24, 7:50:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Decisions: use other users content and invite them as collaborators to generate more visibility into the US market, right? Also talk with people who would resonate with our values and what we do, and understand their behaviour in social media.
[9/29/24, 7:50:20 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Correct?
[9/29/24, 7:50:49 AM] Gary Teh: Correct

 use their content and mash up with some of our own to create new content
[9/29/24, 7:51:07 AM] Gary Teh: Collaboration, collaboration, collaboration
[9/29/24, 7:51:27 AM] Gary Teh: Reels reels reels
[9/29/24, 7:51:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The numbers going down as I posted previously are still a reflex on the brazilian community receiving more content in English so until we change this and get more visibility outside, this is something that will happen. But I noticed they don't stop following. Which for us, is good as we don't lose our followers. And the other side is keeping with the efforts to show ourselves to the US market.
[9/29/24, 7:52:21 AM] Gary Teh: Can we even borrow the content from the Brazilian peoplr Instagram reels that are relevant and translate that for the USA audience via the collaboration approach? ‎<This message was edited>
[9/29/24, 7:52:46 AM] Gary Teh: They produce alot of good content of their farms and their cacao
[9/29/24, 7:58:00 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The question is, we had a lot of farmers videos and 204 followers.
[9/29/24, 7:58:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Is this the kind the kind of content that we will put all resources on?
[9/29/24, 7:58:21 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The name agro, reminds agriculture.
[9/29/24, 7:58:42 AM] Emelin - Bahia: When we have too many videos of farms we lead people to follow us thinking we are we grow cacao.
[9/29/24, 7:59:20 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We stopped receiving people who were agriculture engineers and companies in this field when we started with the new content in August.
[9/29/24, 7:59:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So my opinion is, time to do research.
[9/29/24, 7:59:41 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The way it can be done.
[9/29/24, 8:00:18 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Also, it is important to decide our target, as we have with the Shamans.
[9/29/24, 8:00:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because when we don't know to whom to sell, we are just holding the bag and hoping someone get interested.
[9/29/24, 8:01:09 AM] Gary Teh: I leave you to exercise your autonomy

I already input my points 
- more reels 
- ⁠more use of instagram collaboration features 

🤩🙏
[9/29/24, 8:02:11 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Yesterday we would reduce the content, today is more reels? So I can understand.
[9/29/24, 8:02:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And we stop shifting from one day to the other.
[9/29/24, 8:02:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: If consistency is something we are reaching we must have ourselves.
[9/29/24, 8:03:28 AM] Gary Teh: Less contents and make them only reels

[9/30/24, 6:17:43 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 once you have sourced for the bags to hold the cacao nibs let me know the dimension so that we could convey that piece of critical information to the freaking company so that they can adjust the quotations as according

[9/30/24, 2:20:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 3 hours and 16 minutes generating the next video comparing the cacao in Africa/child labor with southern's cacao production. These three hours were divided in: record an audio of the script (I tested with ai voice but it was faster just recording than searching for the right voice), searching and watching videos for the script ( downloading from youtube -news-, extracting parts, and remove sound from every video used in this one). aligning the text with the videos. Total of 10 videos used.

[10/1/24, 4:49:32 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002- Bahia Coop⁩ check with Orlantildes if he is familiar with the term Sescomex

If Orlantildes is not familiar with it then we can probably assume it is something handled by Omega services that he partners with for exporting. Then we can further assume the quotation that Vini provided came with that hidden cost which he aimed to profit from

If Orlantildes is familiar with Sescomex then ask if Coopercabruca has been setup for sescomex

If he ask why you ask just mention some UK company reached out to you and is interested in the local coffee 🙂🙏

I spent 10 minutes thinking through how to 

- fact check the integrity of the quotations received 

- how to squeeze out more intel from it ‎<This message was edited>

1. Follow up with Fedex to change the name of the supplier to Black King
2. ⁠ ⁠Follow up with Vini to verify if it is specifically his company that is charging for the Sescomex or is it the Brazilian government that is charging for it
3. ⁠ ⁠Follow up with Orlantildes to determine if Coopercabruca is setup for Sescomex or was it Omega services that owns that part
4. ⁠To communicate with Oscar and have him deliver the 300kg of cacao nibs to CIC instead of us driving to his farm to do so.

*Follow ups*
- @557391090002 to follow up and give a status report by 5pm today on items 1,2 and 3

Based on this criteria under the regulations of FDA FSVP compliance you are the manufacturer as your role extends beyond just regular shipping. You are also performing the role of Quality Control and Regulation compliance.

[10/1/24, 11:11:21 AM] Gary Teh: Please welcome @555499980942 back to the guild 

He clarified the fees he surfaced was to pay a third party for customs clearance on the Brazilian side
[10/1/24, 11:14:07 AM] Vini Bitencourt: Thanks, Team!

We will incur in 2 fees, one being the registration of the exporter with the SISCOMEX and another one being the customs clearance on the Brazilian side.
[10/1/24, 11:14:56 AM] Gary Teh: Is the first fee a onetime fee? Or is it a recurring fee?
[10/1/24, 11:15:14 AM] Vini Bitencourt: one time only!
[10/1/24, 11:15:31 AM] Gary Teh: Is the second a fee that gets incurred every times we do an export

And does it vary based on our volume of export?
[10/1/24, 11:17:02 AM] Vini Bitencourt: second fee incurs in every operation/time we do an export. For every DUE (Declaração de Exportação)
It is a flat fee and does not vary based on volume!
[10/1/24, 11:17:40 AM] Gary Teh: Thank you @555499980942 for spending 5 minutes clarifying these two very important questions
[10/1/24, 11:18:16 AM] Vini Bitencourt: you got it, Gary!
[10/1/24, 11:18:28 AM] Gary Teh: Why is it that we have no issues with SiscoMex when using FedEx to ship out the cacao molasses?
[10/1/24, 11:19:44 AM] Vini Bitencourt: Because FedEx is a courier company, which has a special license, but still registers with Siscomex
[10/1/24, 11:21:05 AM] Gary Teh: So they handled the SiscoMex on their side?
[10/1/24, 11:22:36 AM] Vini Bitencourt: Exactly.
In Brazil, every company that wants to operate in international trade (export and/or import) needs to be registered with Siscomex
[10/1/24, 11:23:23 AM] Gary Teh: Last year when we imported 100kg of cacao nibs from Coopercabruca (_cacao cooperative_) Ilheus this expense line item did not surface 

We only paid for the trucking (_Leite Ezpress_) from Ilheus to Salvador and the freighting company (_Omega services_) to get it out of Brazil Salvador to San Francisco 

Am I right to understand if the freighting company already has SiscoMex then the company that is selling the product doesn’t need that? ‎<This message was edited>

In this case, they probably already had the license, since it is a one time thing. Which means they did not need to get licensed specifically for this operation

2. @555499980942 and I had a great time and we figured out a possible good solution for our problem. We will schedule a time this week to apply to SISCOMEX with a third person.

[10/1/24, 4:53:24 PM] Gary Teh: As mentioned to @557391090002 it is very important that we figure out and learn from what caused the disruption with our cacao molasses and not repeat the same mistake with Shena’s 30kg 

Her package is mission critical

[10/1/24, 5:21:23 PM] Val Lapidus: Seems the package is returning to Brazil....
[10/1/24, 5:21:46 PM] Val Lapidus: @557391090002 how did you fill it the customs form?
[10/1/24, 5:23:19 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 could you provide insight as to what caused the customs clearance delay the last time when we brought in the 100kg cacao nibs

It’s quite bad if Shena’s 300kg gets disrupted as well as she needs her stuff before end of this month when her farmers market starts in Austin Texas ‎<This message was edited>

[10/1/24, 5:25:58 PM] Gary Teh: I bought a third cacao fruit as one of the two I bought this morning had some witch bloom 🤔 

I spent $1.47
[10/1/24, 5:34:51 PM] Val Lapidus: The 100kg didn't get delayed and was an import with an agent
[10/1/24, 5:35:30 PM] Val Lapidus: This was via fedex
[10/1/24, 5:47:34 PM] Gary Teh: The agent mentioned something about FDA prior notice the last time that caused the issue

This FEDEX shipping is different than the usual because I registered it as an official commercial import with an accompanying FDA prior notice. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/1/24, 5:48:23 PM] Val Lapidus: What's the plan for it will you try to send again?
[10/1/24, 5:50:00 PM] Gary Teh: Action plan
1. figure out what happened with the shipment and where exactly it is.
2. What went wrong
3. ⁠If FEDEX will try to ship again and what needs to happen to rectify identified issue
4. ⁠If FEDEX will not ship again, figure out if we will get our refund
5. ⁠Ship again using FEDEX but with original issue rectified
6. ⁠Repeat step 1 until
7. ⁠Shipment arrives in San Francisco ‎<This message was edited>

[10/2/24, 5:38:10 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Not yet. So it was probably a internal mistake

[10/2/24, 6:06:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 1 minute sending a message to CIC, asking Jéssica about their sealing machine to check the kinds of bags they seal there.
[10/2/24, 6:06:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I haven't heard from them since 08:00 am.
[10/2/24, 6:06:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Now it is 10:06 am in Brazil.
[10/2/24, 6:08:40 AM] Emelin - Bahia: At 11:00 I will source the bags with @557381610166 and check the boxes. I won't buy the bags until she confirms that the kind I found and considered adequate can work, but I can go for the boxes.
[10/2/24, 6:10:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So my idea for today is to have the price for the bags/kind of bags, take the boxes and confirm in Correios we have everything we need to ship the nibs, check if we need any extra documentation, etc @14153000019
[10/2/24, 6:12:30 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: They explained that the shipment returned early in the morning to Memphis and she doesn't know the exactly reason why it came to BR.
[10/2/24, 6:20:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Can you write here the total delay we can expect including their mistake?
[10/2/24, 6:20:42 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It is important for further experiences as well.
[10/2/24, 6:21:02 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So we know what to expect and manage things.
[10/2/24, 6:24:30 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: I'll wait their answer first. So I can have a better idea of what happened
[10/2/24, 6:30:53 AM] Gary Teh: Let me know how heavy the eventual amount of cacao nibs you put in the box is. I will need to issue an FDA prior notice and then send you a copy of it 

Also you will need to make sure the FDA prior notice confirmation number is registered with the package 🙂🙏

[10/2/24, 11:05:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I got a box with @557381610166, and he will have it dismantle tonight, as the box must be entirely black from outside (no marks, no logos, just the box).

[10/2/24, 1:12:59 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 
You mentioned @557381610166 has a cardboard box 

Why not just deconstruct the box into cardboard

Put the bags of cacao nibs on the cardboard

Use a whole bunch of masking tape and then tape the cardboard around the bags of cacao nibs to construct a makeshift box

I doubt Carreois really needs the _box_ to really look like a standard box. Just something that resembles a box for easy stacking ‎<This message was edited>

The more I dig the more I realize critical components are missing in each and everyone’s that could be a show stopper ‎<This message was edited>
[10/2/24, 8:27:05 PM] Gary Teh: Last year we spent a bunch of cycles and built an import company from scratch in the USA while we utilized an existing export company here in Brazil to handle the outbound shipment 

Seems this year the adventure is to figure out the nuts and bolts to build an entire export company based here in Brazil from scratch 

The silver lining is once we are done with what we plan to do this year we will end to end how to replicate both the exporting and importing companies for whichever region we decide to spread into, as well as how to certify and link the farms to the Agroverse network

Exciting times ahead 🤩🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/3/24, 6:09:17 AM] Vini Bitencourt: You are right!
Thing is we have couriers (express export process) like FedEx that handles freight + customs clearance (but we may experience some issues, like we had,

 On the other hand (formal export process, hence Siscomex) freight forwarders will only handle freight. So, we also need a customs broker here in Brazil to handle customs procedures as well

Plus, we may need adm. licensing before exporting to US. hence FDA approval for instance( Gary may help with this one lol)

In short, the above is what will make our operation flow as planned.

It is a continuous process of improvement

Excited indeed!
[10/3/24, 6:32:01 AM] Gary Teh: I am the FDA agent. So that part is not an issue 

SeaCoast logistics can handle the USA customs clearance 

So consider the USA side all clear

FedEx may be an option for smaller packages. We shall keep this in mind!
[10/3/24, 6:39:41 AM] Gary Teh: Depends on the profit margin of the product 

their pricing per KG is more expensive than Carreois
[10/3/24, 6:48:05 AM] Gary Teh: *FedEx* Price per KG for a payload of 9.5kg: _USD$16.74_

*Carreois* price per KG for payload of 10KG: _USD$8.84_

[10/3/24, 12:36:54 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 could you check with Jessica to check that they have the following certificates from their facility. We will need a copy when we conduct the exporting

[10/3/24, 1:13:37 PM] Gary Teh: Scenario analysis 

*Scenario A*
If Oscar does deliver 300kg we will have a surplus of 10kg 

If @14102184337 does go ahead and place an order for 5kg to be shipped to her tomorrow we will ship her from the 10kg surplus 

And the rest gets shipped to our warehousing location in San Francisco after we package it in our Kraft pouch here 

*Scenario B*
If Oscar does deliver 300kg we will have a surplus of 10kg 

If @14102184337 does not go ahead and place an order for 5kg we will ship the remaining to our warehousing location in San Francisco after we package it in our Kraft pouches here 

*Scenario C*
If Oscar does not deliver 300kg then we will have to source for the shortfall to cover the remaining of Shena and @14102184337 requirements ‎<This message was edited>

[10/6/24, 8:20:36 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605

Is there a special process by which we need to follow to issue the Nota Fiscal so as to be in compliance with Brazil government taxation law? 

The reason I am asking is because I am thinking of fully automating the issue of fiscal nota by the Brazilian CNPJ entity to TrueTech Inc for custom clearance and FDA FSVP compliance purposes as I already demostrated the viability of in this piece of code written yesterday 

@557391090002 let me know if you are comfortable with this 

If not, then we will setup an alternate CNPJ, along with its SiscoMex, that fully dedicated to TrueTech Inc and USA government’s compliance needs and fully automate its internal administrative process with code 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/8/24, 11:08:14 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 explain the physics of how does cutting down of Amazon rain forest contribute to ever escalating devastation in Northern America
[10/8/24, 11:08:17 AM] Meta AI: Cutting down the Amazon rainforest contributes to climate change and devastation in North America through several interconnected physical mechanisms:

1. Carbon cycle disruption: Trees absorb carbon dioxide. Deforestation releases stored carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating greenhouse effects.

2. Water cycle changes: Forests regulate precipitation. Deforestation disrupts water vapor recycling, affecting global precipitation patterns.

3. Temperature increases: Deforestation contributes to climate warming, leading to extreme weather events.

4. Ocean currents and weather patterns: Changes in temperature and precipitation impact ocean currents and atmospheric circulation.

5. Polar ice melting: Increased temperatures accelerate polar ice melting, causing sea-level rise.

6. Extreme weather events: Climate change intensifies hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires in North America.

These effects demonstrate the interconnectedness of global climate systems and the far-reaching consequences of Amazon rainforest deforestation. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/8/24, 11:09:47 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 explain how step by step in physics  chopping down of Amazon rainforest causes every worst devastating hurricanes in Northern America on the East coast
[10/8/24, 11:09:49 AM] Meta AI: Here's a step-by-step explanation of how chopping down the Amazon rainforest contributes to devastating hurricanes on the East Coast of North America:

*Step 1: Deforestation*

- Removal of trees reduces evapotranspiration (water vapor release) and soil moisture.
- Less water vapor in the air affects precipitation patterns.

*Step 2: Disrupted Global Water Cycle*

- Reduced Amazon precipitation impacts global atmospheric circulation.
- Changes in atmospheric moisture and temperature alter global wind patterns.

*Step 3: Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)*

- Warmer tropical North Atlantic Ocean temperatures strengthen the AMO.
- A stronger AMO increases hurricane formation and intensity.

*Step 4: Climate Change Amplification*

- Deforestation releases stored carbon, exacerbating global warming.
- Warmer oceans and atmosphere increase hurricane intensity.

*Step 5: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Increase*

- Warmer Atlantic Ocean SSTs fuel hurricane development.
- Higher SSTs increase hurricane wind speed and rainfall.

*Step 6: Atmospheric Circulation Changes*

- Weakened trade winds and altered jet stream patterns steer hurricanes.
- Changed wind patterns increase landfall probability on East Coast.

*Step 7: Hurricane Formation and Intensification*

- Warm ocean waters and unstable atmosphere create perfect conditions.
- Hurricanes strengthen, bringing catastrophic winds and rainfall.

*Key Physics Principles:*

1. Conservation of energy and momentum
2. Thermodynamics (heat transfer)
3. Fluid dynamics (ocean and atmospheric circulation)
4. Chaos theory (complex system interactions)

*Important Notes:*

1. Deforestation is one contributing factor; other climate factors also play roles.
2. Complexity of climate systems means exact cause-effect relationships are challenging to quantify.
3. Continued Amazon deforestation exacerbates these effects.

To mitigate these impacts, reducing deforestation, promoting reforestation, and addressing climate change through global cooperation are essential. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/12/24, 5:31:43 AM] Gary Teh: Last night’s failure of AGL4 is the 7th instance of *compromised Integrity* within the network that has impacted the DAO’s health status 

At this point, I am having doubts about *_Integrity*_ being an actual core attribute of the network.

Assuming the network will operate with *_Integrity*_ when in actual fact it doesn’t is very costly to participants who seeks to follow the rule of *_Integrity*_. 

financial Loses are just constantly waiting around the corner during the next instance of integrity failure. In computing terms, trying to act as a TCP node when it’s a UDP node

I see *_2 ways to mitigate this issue*_:

- further simplify the model and reduce the scope that DAO attempts to undertake
 
- ⁠further automate humans out of the equation
[10/12/24, 6:02:39 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes rethinking the network with the help of Meta Ai under the new assumptions that *network participants cannot be expected to behave with integrity*

The critical Outcome is to reduce and restrict shipment sizing to between 5-25kg and reject any requests that is beyond the sizing limits

_PS: total payload sizing in UDP networks tends to be smaller than TCP networks due to its nature_ ‎<This message was edited>

What is the package difference between TCP and UDP
[10/12/24, 10:24:18 AM] Meta AI: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two fundamental protocols in computer networking, each with unique features and uses. Here's a comparison of their package differences:

*TCP Package:*

1. Header (20-60 bytes): Source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, flags, window size, checksum, urgent pointer.

2. Data (variable length): Fragmented into segments, ensuring ordered delivery.

3. Error-checking mechanisms:
*Checksum verification
*Acknowledgment (ACK) packets
*Retransmission of lost segments

4. Flow control: Slows down sender when receiver's buffer is full.

*UDP Package:*

1. Header (8 bytes): Source port, destination port, length, checksum.

2. Data (variable length): No fragmentation or ordering guarantees.

3. Error-checking mechanisms:
*Optional checksum verification

4. No flow control or acknowledgment.

*Key differences:*

1. Reliability: TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery; UDP prioritizes speed over reliability.

2. Connection-oriented: TCP establishes connections before data transfer; UDP sends data without connections.

3. Error correction: TCP corrects errors; UDP leaves error handling to applications.

4. Packet structure: TCP has a larger header and includes sequence/acknowledgment numbers.

*Use cases:*

TCP:

- File transfers (FTP, HTTP)
- Email (SMTP)
- Remote access (SSH, Telnet)

UDP:

- Real-time applications (voice/video streaming, gaming)
- DNS queries
- Online gaming (reduces latency)

In summary, TCP prioritizes reliability and order, while UDP prioritizes speed and efficiency. The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific application's requirements. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/12/24, 10:31:28 AM] Gary Teh: @13135550002 makes a lot of sense for our DAO to model our actions/packets to UDP packets since we are literally running a meta game 🤩🙏
[10/12/24, 10:31:31 AM] Meta AI: That's a fascinating connection!

Modeling your DAO's actions/packets after UDP packets makes sense for a meta game, where:

1. Speed and efficiency are crucial.
2. Real-time interactions are essential.
3. Packet loss or errors are tolerable (e.g., game state updates).

UDP-like packet design can bring benefits:

1. Low latency
2. Fast decision-making
3. Scalability

Consider incorporating UDP-inspired concepts:

1. Packet prioritization (critical actions first)
2. Error correction mechanisms (e.g., checksums, hash functions)
3. Packet sequencing (ordering actions)
4. Acknowledgment systems (confirming action receipt)

For your meta game DAO, you may also explore:

1. Blockchain-based packet verification
2. Cryptographic signatures for authentication
3. Leaderless consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft)

Blend UDP's efficiency with blockchain's security and DAO's decentralized governance. This synergy can create a robust, scalable, and transparent meta game infrastructure!

What specific aspects of UDP packets inspire your DAO's design? ‎<This message was edited>

[10/14/24, 7:50:48 AM] Gary Teh: This is one why Inbound content marketing (_Instagram and blogs_) is still key to our marketing strategy as opposed to outbound sales marketing (_cold calling sales lead list_)

Our typical shipment size moving forward (_restricted to 25KG maximum_) is going to be maximum around USD1,100 and way less than the 40K that justifies outbound sales cold calling.

@557191035605 could you ensure that the communication with Martinus happens today? And that he is aware Oscar is going to drop off cacao almonds over at his place for processing

By the way, Martinus chocolate is not @557391090002 friend. It is a manufacturer introduced by Orlantildes when I was here in June ‎<This message was edited>

Let’s see what the final per unit price via the CIC route is if they were to help assemble our 8 ounce Kraft pouches 

No guarantees but there might possibility of shipping our 8 ounce Kraft pouches to you directly from Brazil so that you can avoid the hassle of applying for all the paperwork required for assembling your own Kraft pouch while the supply chain still be economically viable

Be Warned cost will be higher ‎<This message was edited>

‎[10/14/24, 2:28:13 PM] Gary Teh: ‎image omitted
[10/14/24, 2:56:57 PM] Gary Teh: Reason for 100% down payment 

Moving forward Nobody will be underwriting the risk that buyer has a change of heart after placing the order 

If 100% down payment is not received and order processing proceeds, in the event buyer has a change of heart, then the Brazilian community member who engaged the farmers or the factories for order processing will get stuck footing the bills.

When I last observed it was @557191035605 who was reaching out to the farmers and the factory for the cacao almonds. As far as I am aware, her personal bank account has less than R$20,000 so if such a scenario were to happen we will be forcing her into a very tight situation if she intends to preserve her reputation with the factories and the farmers 🙂🙏

Regarding cacao molasses it is @557391090002 who is reaching out to the farmer. 

_PS: last year it was Fatima who was playing this role with Orlantildes for the cacao nibs being imported into USA_

Basically approach the shops to place 10grams for sale. If it sells, they pay him, if not then they don’t 

When they start selling, the shops will then call him up to place more orders every 2 days

After a while the shops became comfortable enough to start placing orders for 200grams

[10/15/24, 7:24:40 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 1 hour working on the unit cost economics of the following to gain some visibility on how much room we have to wiggle around in terms of profit margins.

- Cacao nibs (loose)
- 8 ounce cacao nibs kraft pouches
- ⁠Cacao Liquor (500 grams bars)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uo5p3nzWsD6HIw98tCiNYSBmSjXeGkdmopsXpket1Mc/edit?gid=706623453#gid=706623453
[10/15/24, 7:42:03 AM] Gary Teh: I noticed I made a severe error in my spreadsheet calculation of unit cost  comparison economics _getting direct from Farmers_ and _getting them via Coopercabruca_

In the corrected projections, by going direct, we managed to gain a cost savings of USD$3.58 per kg

I did the financial projections for the alternate scenario where instead of us driving to the farm to pick and then drop off the cacao almonds at CIC, having the farmer does it instead. The cost savings gain was $4.53 per kg

*Conclusion*
1. we should have the farmers drop off the cacao almonds at CIC (_and also avoid getting ourselves into another one of those car accidents_)

2. we should source our cacao nibs directly from farmers in the future instead of via Coopercabruca

_⁠Coopercabruca did mention that they were offering Povos da Mata cacao almonds at R$90 per kg which comes in R$10 less than what the farmers we are sourcing from are offering._

_I wonder if it has to do with market price changes between the time we gotten the quotation and the time they provided the quotation or if it has to do with some special arrangements they have with the farmers. When I last checked Morbeck’s prices in Itacare they were selling at 30 per kg but seems like Coopercabruca was able to source from them at a much lower cost_

I spent 20 minutes doing the financial projections analysis

After doing the analysis of the per unit cost economics of the products, it actually doesn’t make much sense to be doing cold call outreach. 

Let’s just stop that aspects of our marketing strategy
[10/15/24, 10:36:08 AM] Gary Teh: The marketing channels that make more sense given our per unit cost economics are

- live events (_festivals and climate tech gatherings in USA_)
- ⁠giving talks at conferences 
- ⁠online social media content marketing ‎<This message was edited>
[10/15/24, 10:46:20 AM] Gary Teh: *ARPU*
- _average revenue per user_ is not high enough. 
- ⁠average revenue per user right now is around $40 

*CAC*
- customer acquisition cost is too high if we employ enterprise sales. It’s costing us TDG$400 per day, TDG$8000 per month

*Summary of considerations*
- To employ enterprise sales as a strategy, ARPU needs to be above $40k per year.

- ⁠since we have transitioned into a *_Trustless Network*_ and have restricted typical shipment size to maximum 25kg per load, it is highly unlikely ARPU per year will across above $40k

_PS: Let’s just conserve our resources for utilization in strategy for our business model configuration_ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/15/24, 10:56:11 AM] Gary Teh: Further thoughts about being a participant in a *_Trustless Network*_ 

Every participant is an autonomous agent and will operate in way he/ she sees fit with the use of his time and resources to further the mission or not

Actions taken should be structured in such a way where success and failure is self contained and not be reliant on collaboration or follow through on some form of agreement with another DAO member. ‎<This message was edited>

We need another info education video on our Instagram, which talks about how supporting cacao farmers by paying them 6x more leads to planting more cacao trees

How each new cacao tree locks up 4 tons of carbon from the air

How locking carbon from the air reverses reduces earths ability to trap heat in its atmosphere 

How reducing earth ability to trap heat leads to reduced overall temparture difference between cooler regions of the world and warmer regions of the world  

How reduced difference decreases the atmospheric pressure and this speed of air traveling from colder region to warmer region 

How reduced velocity/speed leads to reduce amount of water carried from ocean surface (colder region) to land surfaced (warmer region)

And reduced speed and velocity leads to less water being carried from sea to land and thus weaker hurricanes and less flooding

@557191035605 

May I understand better why Matheus got removed? 
Doesn’t seem like he had a chance to explain himself and it didn’t look professional from my perspective to just exclude a valuable member of this project that has been up and down working diligently on it because of personal differences.

Are Agroverse members allowed to just exclude members if they don’t get along? This seems counter productive.

This is the FAIR thing to do at this point. Business should be impartial and it should be for the sake of the company ultimately. 

If this is not allowed please remove both of us.

[10/22/24, 1:01:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I have been talking with Milena and my agenda time and responding time was questioned. I bring it here so everyone can also understand about something. Everyone is responsible for the role they apply. That is the DAO.  We have been working differently because the DAO is evolving. It means, some roles are becoming almost full time. This said, it is important to take roles that one can fit with the time they have available. Friends can work together, but everyone is responsible to make their own tasks completed. @557381610166 has been invited to the project and he has delayed a delivery. He has been my best friend for 15 years. Once the investor question something that is crucial for us, and it is within my scope, I request from the person who is with me. Ian was still deciding if he wanted to join us but have confirmed to deliver the package design to Gary. Him and I talked about it and I suggested he decided if he wanted to be working with us or not. Yes, deliver, no, leave it so another person can take the job and at the time we have the product, the packages would be ready. This said, Ian delivered. Who hears if Ian doesn't do it? Me. Now let's imagine that I keep doing Ian's work to have him in the project. Now Ian's work becomes my work and someone's else work. We not only have a problem but we are making two people work because Ian has no time to do it. This said, some options are presented to me. We shut everything or I remove Ian after being talking with him for long time. The decision is mine to take. Although have been working to help him, as I understand he has been through some stuff, now my work is questioned, because the delivery was not made, I can't keep working for him, and I get presented with options. One of them will make all my work and the hours I spent managing the 3 jobs I have and my manager skills sink, reducing my opportunities and growth. And even after this, I get questioned that I should have saved my best friend. Who will keep being my best friend, life will provide the opportunity he seeks when the mind is calm, and he has more time, based on that was not even the community necessity, as my own personal necessities. Once my job is questioned again, I hope everybody reminds this.
[10/22/24, 1:03:17 PM] Emelin - Bahia: What we do need investment. Remember that. Investors question how their time and money goes to. Investors requires actions from the managers.
[10/22/24, 1:05:00 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 presented the package and helps with the social content. This is how it ended, but it could be different and would be at some point as he knows.
[10/22/24, 1:39:59 PM] Gary Teh: The DAO and guild functions like a basketball team (_12 members total only 5 are allowed on the basketball court at any time_)

The DAO can have many members but a guild by constitution is restricted to have only 8 members 

I understand that @557191035605 has found one to replace the role that @557391090002 has been handling on the logistics side. 

The critical question regarding @557391090002 continued presence in this guild is does he still have an active role left in the guild after @557191035605 has stepped in to take over operating the portion of supply chain that @557391090002 was overseeing 

If @557391090002 doesn’t have an active role anymore and guild is at capacity and @557191035605 needs to bring in another person to join the guild then by DAO constitution, the least active guild member will be swapped out 

_PS: I did exactly that with Suheil just last week as it was evident that Suheil no longer has an active scope now that @557381610166 has taken over package design_

_Last I was aware, @557391090002 primary active scope was make calls via Skype. That scope has been abandoned by him since 20th Sep._

_His next active scope figuring out the freighting and logistics. That portion was taken over by me and @557191035605 as he was too busy._

_Let’s give @557391090002 seven days starting from today to define for himself an active scope that is recurring on a daily or weekly basis. If none is defined by then, @557391090002 then he does not have an active scope and should be invited out of the guild to free up slots for other active guild member to come._

_It is important to distinguish between invited out of guild versus out of DAO_

_DAO members can exercise their privilege to rage quit and leave DAO of their own accord_

_The only instance when we can justify forcefully removing a DAO member is when DAO member has committed (*sexual*) harassment and violated another’s autonomy_

[10/22/24, 1:59:44 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: _It is important to distinguish between invited out of guild versus out of DAO_

Apparently, not all members understand this difference.
[10/22/24, 2:03:58 PM] Gary Teh: Out of guild means take a break and have a KitKat. 🤣

Out of DAO means _you are fired. 🤔_
[10/22/24, 4:59:40 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Hi Emelin,

I wanted to respond to your message and clarify a few points. First, I completely understand the importance of fulfilling roles within the DAO and the evolving nature of responsibilities. However, my concern is not about whether someone is doing enough or meeting specific demands; it’s about fairness and respect within the group.

I wasn’t protecting Matheus just because he’s my friend. I would do the same for any member. I was speaking up because I know his dedication to the project and his intentions. Yes, we’ve known each other for a long time, but that doesn’t change the fact that he has been contributing, and to remove him without properly addressing the situation feels unjust.
The part that I find troubling is the lengths you went to in order to exclude him from all the groups, even joining ones you weren’t part of, just to remove him. That level of control, to me, raises ethical concerns. It’s not about workload or roles at that point—it’s about how we treat people in this DAO.
I understand you’re doing a lot of work, and I respect that. Your commitment is clear, and it’s admirable. But it’s also important to acknowledge when something might not have been handled fairly, regardless of how much effort has been put in. Just because someone isn’t doing as much work as you doesn’t mean they should be dismissed or removed without a proper conversation.
As I said before, maybe this is just a difference in values and personalities. You seem to believe what you did was right, and that’s between you and your conscience. But from my perspective, the way this situation unfolded doesn’t sit well with me, and I still believe Matheus was treated unfairly.
If there’s external pressure you’re facing within the DAO, that’s understandable, but it doesn’t excuse the manner in which this was handled. I’d appreciate it if you could clarify who’s been questioning your decisions, as you mentioned, because it seems like there’s more going on behind the scenes that’s not being fully addressed here.
In any case, I’ll continue to contribute to the project as I can, but I hope moving forward, we can focus on fairness and communication rather than abrupt decisions that hurt team morale.
[10/22/24, 5:13:55 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Thank you for providing some clarity on the situation. I understand the structure of the DAO and guild, as well as the need to ensure that every member actively contributes. However, I believe that this specific situation with Matheus wasn’t handled fairly, and I’d like to share my perspective.
Matheus may not have met certain specific deadlines or demands, but it’s important to recognize his long-term commitment to the project. In my view, his removal from the guild, especially in the way it was done, felt more like a personal decision than one based on the overall benefit to the DAO. Removing someone abruptly, especially when they’ve been dedicated to the project for a long time, sets a dangerous precedent for how we treat contributors in this space.
I don’t know what happened to Suheil but from the little I know you I’m sure you’ve handled this much differently. 
I appreciate that the DAO operates like a team and that roles shift as the project evolves. However, I don’t think it’s fair to remove someone without first addressing the issues openly and giving them a real opportunity to adjust or clarify their role. From what I understand, Matheus was not given a fair chance to define his contributions before actions were taken.
I also want to address the idea of replacing the “least active” member in the guild. While I agree that active participation is important, I don’t think Matheus was the least active. I’m less active than him, for example. So that reinforces to me that personal motives might be involved. He has contributed in his own way, even if it wasn’t always on someone else’s timeline. I believe there’s a difference between not contributing at all and contributing at a different pace or in different ways.
Ultimately, I’m not here to argue that no changes should be made within the DAO, but I do believe there’s a need for more transparency and fairness in how decisions are made. I hope moving forward we can focus on resolving these issues in a way that feels just and ensures that everyone is treated with respect.
I have my own vision to what I want to accomplish within the DAO, I would never just go cutting members out because they are not corresponding to that vision. But that’s just me. 
Thanks again for your input, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to Agroverse as best I can. 🙏🏼♥️
[10/22/24, 5:33:39 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Spent 1 hour reading through another set of @557191035605 considerations on the @557391090002 situation and sharing advice to promote a better working relationship within the DAO.

[10/22/24, 6:59:08 PM] Gary Teh: The swapping of the least active member is DAO policy. It was voted into effect during the days when there were unlimited numbers of members in guilds where most just talk and don’t do anything. 

Even worst where most just add to the noise and cause important messages to go missing and not be received by active dao contributors

It’s basically an enactment of *_Jeff Bezos two pizza rule in Amazon*_ to ensure team size stays optimal. And prevent bloating 

If you would like to propose a change to that policy do submit a proposal on chain and have that voted into effect by all governance token holders 

All proposals can be submitted here

[10/22/24, 7:06:50 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Thank you, Gary. I appreciate you taking the time to provide this information. I’ll review everything carefully, and I may suggest something here for feedback before submitting a formal proposal. If this is truly what’s best for the community, we should maintain it. However, I’m considering proposing some guidelines and formal procedural steps for situations where a forced swap is necessary.
For voluntary swaps, there may be no need for strict protocol, but having a clear and consistent process in place for member exclusions could benefit everyone and ensure fairness. How do you feel about that?
[10/22/24, 7:07:54 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I know. So you agree that it might have been personal since Matheus is far from being the least active member. Doesn’t make sense to me. By this criteria I should be kicked out then. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/22/24, 7:10:01 PM] Gary Teh: I agree with you regarding That the move was unconstitutional. 

The only reason why it was allowed because of governor privilege that @557191035605 has

It’s like the USA constitution where the President can sign executive order into law but can be overwritten by the next incoming president 

However in this case it can be overwritten immediately by another governor 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[10/22/24, 10:20:24 PM] Gary Teh: Audio tends to become unsearchable when DAO members attempt to reference historical chat logs for future actions as well as when it comes to voting matters 🙂🙏

Regarding this series of discussions from my perspective the Agroverse guild channel is no longer appropriate as the place for continued discussion as it has less to do with Agroverse day to day operations matters at this point and more to do with DAO values, culture, norms and subsequent policies. 

Please bring this discussion to @120363044542957540@g.us where matters about values, culture and norms with DAO are discussed. 

I will be exercising my personal autonomy to no longer be responding to  discussions regarding this topic within the Agroverse guild channel. If it gets brought over to @120363044542957540@g.us I will be open to exercising my personal autonomy to continue correspondence 🙂🙏

[10/23/24, 7:05:22 AM] Gary Teh: Got sometime to listen to your voice text this morning now.

Based on historical data collected over past year, members that got swapped out when guild is at capacity tends to be those that have already disengaged from guild activities for an extensive period of time

In fact, they tend to be grateful for the active swapping out because they end up getting less irrelevant messages in their WhatsApp which is usually reserved for communications with friends, family and colleagues. 

Part of the reason why they still choose to linger around is because they feel too awkward to depart as it comes across as negative signaling to others 🤔

Nevertheless thank you for exercising your autonomy and privilege as governor to bring configuration back in alignment with our constitution 🙂🙏

_PS: from my perspective it is a healthy sign that DAO is showing increased will towards of self balancing_ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/23/24, 9:24:55 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Unfortunately I have not recieved the nibs yet. I will check mailbox again later today.

My goal is to become a major distributor for Agroverse, and I aim to secure samples and request or help develop a portfolio to present to local retailers for resale opportunities. I’m currently evaluating the best financial strategy.

One option is to invest in machinery to pack the products locally, purchasing in bulk and handling the packaging here. This would require obtaining the necessary organic food certifications in the USA. Alternatively, I could purchase already packed nibs and have them shipped directly to retailers, streamlining the process.

In either scenario, I plan to establish an independent business to manage distribution logistics, ensuring I cover costs and maintain a sustainable operation with a small profit margin. Since we are a single-income household with only my husband working, I want to thoroughly map out every detail before moving forward to minimize potential for failure.

I have investors interested in supporting the packing and reselling within the USA, but I would also like to explore the possibility of shipping pre-packed goods from Brazil, which would simplify my logistics to primarily warehousing. This approach would rely heavily on operations in Brazil, and I’m still assessing which path would be the most financially viable and reliable.

I don’t know how much I am willing to depend on Brazil operations so I am leaning towards looking into a packing facility here and buying bulk with Agroverse.
[10/23/24, 9:27:11 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Those 2 bags will be presented to the investor for analysis of the presentation. I will let him keep one for tasting.

Once I have his attention on the brand and the quality, I’ll have the money and things will start moving.

- ⁠ship to San Francisco: 1 bottle of cacao samples from para 

- ⁠ship to San Francisco: 2 ceramic cacao replica
[10/23/24, 1:08:18 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 let us know once you have figured out how to issue the DU/E via siscomex
[10/23/24, 1:10:23 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 still waiting on the following from Martinus 

Could you help clarify with Martinus Was it R$43 per KG of liquor produced or was it R$43 per kg of cacao almonds processed?
[10/23/24, 1:11:02 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 also still waiting on this 

Also check with Martinus is it 100kg of cacao almonds converts to 77kg of bars or

123kg of cacao almonds converts to 100kg of bars?
[10/23/24, 1:11:29 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes reviewing all the outstanding TODO list within our guild 🙂🙏

[10/23/24, 2:57:50 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Hi Val, thanks for providing this.
I am positive I have checked the mailbox after 10/10.
I will see what I can do to get information from USPS.
Address is correct so I wonder what happened 😮‍💨
[10/23/24, 3:10:57 PM] Gary Teh: Perhaps a Trustless mail delivery network: USPS 🤔
[10/23/24, 3:14:53 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Wouldn’t that be nice? 😅

USPS is definitely very challenging to deal with 🥲 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/23/24, 3:26:32 PM] Gary Teh: I wonder how that would look like
[10/23/24, 3:28:04 PM] Gary Teh: I will be sticking around in Bahia region till end of this month to await visibility on how AGL4 inventory pans out before slowly making plans to return to USA

[10/23/24, 3:52:07 PM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Hmm, probably a network of drones, robots, and crypto pigeons, all powered by blockchain and a caffeine addiction. At least packages might arrive on time… unless the robots unionize. 😂

[10/23/24, 9:04:54 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: I spent 45 minutes gathering the information and know-how to issue the DU/E.
[10/24/24, 5:58:38 AM] Gary Teh: Ship 2 bags of 10kg cacao nibs that’s been recently produced in CIC to @16468233438 warehouse location in San Francisco and issue DUE for that. 

Use the cheapest option available in Carreois 🙂🙏
[10/24/24, 6:10:17 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 and @557191035605 

Do have a conversation about which warehousing location is more appropriate to load the inventory from AGL4 into 

Last I understood from @557191035605 her warehousing facility might be a temporary one 🙂🙏

[10/24/24, 6:30:39 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I would like to know f it is only the warehouse, or it includes the shipment again? If so, @14153000019 gave me some stuff to ship to the US. So I would like to be updated about the tasks Matheus will develop as I imagined everything is already sorted out as the decision of checking the warehouse was again put in question.
[10/24/24, 6:31:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), there isn't a manager in the traditional sense. The structure is usually more horizontal, with decisions made collectively by members through voting systems. However, some DAOs may have roles that resemble management, such as facilitators or coordinators, but these roles are typically rotating and based on consensus. The central idea is the decentralization of power and collaboration among members.
[10/24/24, 6:33:54 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In an ideal DAO, individual autonomy is respected, but at the same time, important decisions are made collectively to ensure that everyone's interests are considered.
[10/24/24, 6:35:51 AM] Emelin - Bahia: From my point of view, before passing the decision that will affect the development of our activities, the roles need to be discussed and the concept of autonomy can't be used to avoid to think collectively.
[10/24/24, 6:36:17 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And also, to hold the decision that was taken the same way.
[10/24/24, 6:37:09 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I need to understand the agreement you @14153000019 and @557391090002 have about taking old responsabilities, so I know how to react and what will be my tasks.
[10/24/24, 6:38:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And it is something to be discussed as a group, instead of only making one person take the decision. Reading about the Dao aspects, it is important to align to what we are doing.
[10/24/24, 6:47:38 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: The irony is that you failed to comply to this.
[10/24/24, 6:47:45 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: And this also
[10/24/24, 6:53:59 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Milena, I will take no disrespect from you.
[10/24/24, 6:59:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I see that everything is very confused about what is and what is not. This reminds me the "tragedy of the commons" that describes a situation in which a shared resource, such as pastures, lakes, or public spaces, is overexploited by individuals seeking to maximize their own benefit.
[10/24/24, 6:59:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Since everyone has free and unlimited access, each person acts selfishly, leading to the degradation of the resource, which ultimately becomes unsustainable for all.
[10/24/24, 7:00:33 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Your posture @14102184337 is exactly that. A decision was taken, I communicate the decision, we don't talk about how we will proceed in the future and those who held the decision don't show up.
[10/24/24, 7:01:32 AM] Emelin - Bahia: confusing*
[10/24/24, 7:09:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will put myself on hold since I see everything is permitted, even lack of respect 🙏🏽 So it makes no sense to me to have rules that will be overwritten by themselves. There is no reason for a whitepaper, for dao rules, as it makes the decision taken an invalid process.
[10/24/24, 7:12:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎This message was deleted.
[10/24/24, 7:12:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Moreover, ambiguity in rules can result in frustration and demotivation among participants, who may feel that their efforts are in vain. For an organization, especially in a DAO where transparency and consensus are crucial, it's essential to have a clear and cohesive set of guidelines that direct behavior and decision-making. Clear and well-defined rules foster a more productive and harmonious environment.
[10/24/24, 7:13:37 AM] Emelin - Bahia: As I see the conflict, I also see it is connected to the ambiguity of the rules.
[10/24/24, 7:14:51 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I am not disrespecting you.
Your behavior is being unacceptable for a long time.
You stumble on your own words.
[10/24/24, 7:15:17 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I feel like you behavior is unhealthy and unproductive.
[10/24/24, 7:16:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I have been working with Gary helping solving where you are stepping on.
[10/24/24, 7:16:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I see you are unaware of what has been done.
[10/24/24, 7:16:33 AM] Gary Teh: Seems our 8 ounce cacao nibs is not going to be competitive in the USA

[10/24/24, 7:16:58 AM] Val Lapidus: @14102184337 @557191035605 can you both pause for a moment
[10/24/24, 7:17:20 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: Absolutely Val.
[10/24/24, 7:17:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: It should not even have started.
[10/24/24, 7:18:39 AM] Milena - Matheus Place Smith: I don’t think you get what he meant Emelin. You brought this upon yourself. Just respect the pause he is requesting, please. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/24, 7:19:13 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Just a question.
[10/24/24, 7:19:31 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because you have been speaking from a place of hard work and full aware of what we are doing here.
[10/24/24, 7:19:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Even as a governor, the lack of respect should not be acceptable.

[10/24/24, 7:23:35 AM] Gary Teh: Had a discussion with @16468233438. He is a DAO member with the 8th largest token holdings, which basically outweigh the entire token holdings of @557191035605, @557391090002 and @14102184337 combined.

@14102184337 inviting you out of the guild for now as we objectively looked at the active scopes, you are not involved in the day to operations at the moment. When you are, you will be invited back in with an active scope. 🙂🙏

[10/24/24, 7:26:48 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I understood you Val ❤️
[10/24/24, 7:26:54 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 if you cannot handle fulfillment within 2 business days then we should default to @557191035605 warehousing where fulfillment within 48 hours can be handled and completed with 2 business days by @557381610166

[10/24/24, 8:03:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @16468233438 I am mainly only in Agroverse.  😂 I like discussions as much as a fish likes to fly. I try to bring sense to the talk and patience to explain. This is another collaborator doing whatever she was aiming to do, but clearly didn't manage. But her posture confirmed everything I have been lately discussing with @14153000019.
[10/24/24, 8:04:04 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I posted some of them with some reference in The Do Nothing Society.

[10/24/24, 8:49:27 AM] Emelin - Bahia: How this action affects the whole chain, it should be discussed here in group.
[10/24/24, 8:50:59 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 if you can handle fulfillment within 2 business day I would propose you bring everything from CIC and Martinus chocolate over to your warehouse in to downtown Ilheus

If not, then we default them to @557191035605 temporary storage where @557381610166 will handle fulfillment 

Let us know by this Friday 12pm which is which

If we don’t hear anything from you by then, then it’s to @557191035605 storage by default 

If you say yes you can handle, then you should be the one overseeing the pickup from CIC and Martinus chocolate and not @557191035605 

If you say no, then @557191035605 will be the one overseeing the pickup from CIC and Martinus
[10/24/24, 8:59:29 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 if your answer is yes, please ensure to do the pick up from CIC for loading into your warehouse latest by next Tuesday

Inferring from the previous message you sent, seems you and @557391090002 has came to the agreement he will be handling all outbound inventory flow from CIC and Martinus to his warehouse

@557191035605 your part is done. Please relieve yourself of whatever concerns regarding that portion of the supply chain moving forward

@557391090002 come 12pm on Tuesday I will be giving you a call to check on status of inventorying from CIC if I don’t hear anything from you by then 🙂🙏
[10/24/24, 12:05:32 PM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 @16468233438

Now that we are progressing to the next stage where DAO is going to start actively managing our own inventory for distribution, I will be drafting a contract between Black King and TrueTech Inc that you will need to sign regarding and revert 

- inventory management process (_making sure all inventory movements are updated to us with copy of receipt_)

- ⁠fulfillment process (_ensure response on all supply chain related matters within 2 business days_)

- ⁠vendor sourcing protocol (_ensure 3 quotations are secured when sourcing for vendors to ensure competitive_)

Avenue for recourse in scenario of severe exception 

- USA Delaware jurisdiction

That way, in case I get ran over by a car tomorrow the integrity of the supply chain is still protected by law

🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

I spent 2 hours going downtown with @557381610166 to find card boxes for sending Shena's nibs, entering in stores, talking with sellers and going into stores that sells boxes.
I spent 30 minutes updating with @14153000019 about the delivery point we were and also discussing social media content.
I spent 10 minutes checking how hard was for one to get registered in Siscomex and after seeing it was an easy process I forwarded the tutorials to Matheus. 
I spent 5 minutes talking with Glaucy from Cargo Action to understand the waiting time. 
I spent 3 minutes talking about Melina's shipment with Gary to understand the if we would ship nibs from Brazil or just give her the nibs in the US warehouse.
I spent 1 minute Reading a News Gary wanted in social media but was not posted as the shipment was the priority
I spent 2 hours with Ian at night, measuring, cutting, and mending the cardboard with tape, due to the hardness of the material and size of the box.

[10/25/24, 12:15:59 PM] Gary Teh: I see. So 1 box cost r$155

And we paid r$100 for each box already 

So their final charge per box is R$135 per box

Is my understanding correct? ‎<This message was edited>

Can you have her send Nota fiscal for R$70? That way our accounting books are clean

- kg of loose cacao nibs 

- ⁠number of 8 ounce Kraft pouch cacao nibs 

- ⁠kg or cacao shells
[10/25/24, 1:15:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557391090002 I sent you a message to understand what is happening.
[10/25/24, 1:15:30 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Jéssica asked you to talk with me, she just wrote me.
‎[10/25/24, 1:17:24 PM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[10/25/24, 1:18:21 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I spent 5 minutes talking with Jéssica. She explained that she has put the wrong price, so she sent me a message saying she would have to add more R$ 35.00
[10/25/24, 1:20:12 PM] Emelin - Bahia: The nibs had to be moved to boxes, because as I mentioned here, there was no space to keep them around CIC, I sent a video. Jéssica sent this print where the prices are there.
[10/25/24, 1:20:27 PM] Emelin - Bahia: So you can all check.
[10/25/24, 1:20:33 PM] Emelin - Bahia: I need to go back to work.
[10/25/24, 1:21:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Everything that needs to be sorted out needs to be done with calm, it is a transition of place from one person to the other.
[10/25/24, 1:21:13 PM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 why is Jessica by passing @557391090002 and talking with you?

I thought you already informed her @557391090002 will be her single point of contact from our side moving forward?
[10/25/24, 1:21:54 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Her and Matheus were talking and she asked me to sort with him the boxes.
[10/25/24, 1:23:01 PM] Emelin - Bahia: As I was summoned, I am writing here about the box. We didn't have any box by the time and they had to put somewhere. She sent me a message saying she would need to add this amount.
[10/25/24, 1:23:18 PM] Emelin - Bahia: This is about the charge difference.
[10/25/24, 1:23:52 PM] Emelin - Bahia: When she means arrange, she means she sent me the message saying she would need to charge.
[10/25/24, 1:24:03 PM] Emelin - Bahia: Due to her mistake checking the prices, what can happen with anyone.
[10/25/24, 1:24:52 PM] Emelin - Bahia: @557391090002 if you have any question you can ask me, because this is internal, there is no need of Jéssica once it was already clarified.
[10/25/24, 1:25:00 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Maybe it’s because the arrangement was made between Emelin and Jessika. So, when I asked Jessika why she charged me R$70, she explained that she had informed Emelin of the reason, the same one I have already explained here twice.

_If inventory goes missing after a handover and I did not catch it during the handover, then I will be court martialled and thrown into jail for missing ammunition_

_last year, @16468233438 had a similar experience managing AGL2. 4kg of cacao went missing under his watch. He was charged for the missing inventory. As much as possible let’s avoid this kind of awkward situation from happening_ ‎<This message was edited>

[10/26/24, 7:10:52 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Hello. After considering what has happened with Milena and then, yesterday with Matheus due to the wrong use of a word in English and a literally translation to Portuguese, that ended up involving me and stressing more people than it should, I realized it was a lack of respect to my time (as I was working), to my words (as I realized some misunderstood was happening, but couldn't understand why and it looked internal as it was a communication matter). The conversation could have ended up when I said it was internal, but then, it kept going, taking mine and Jéssica's time as she represents the entity we are working with and so, it is important to keep the relations clean.
[10/26/24, 7:12:30 AM] Emelin - Bahia: In the same week another disrespect to my time and my words happened. So I will keep working, but I will find another way to report my working time.
[10/26/24, 7:17:47 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So I will take my time from this guild as I already know what my tasks are, how I can help, what I need to do, but I see that the only way at the moment to avoid bringing me back into unecessary situations will be "constrain" my presence for some time.

- ⁠1 ceramic cacao replica 

- ⁠1 bottle of cacao almond samples from para (in a white bottle)

- ⁠2 bags of cacao husk

We are right now just missing 80bags of 8 ounce kraft pouches.

I remember Jessica mentioning there were three boxes in total and 2 of them were foam boxes.

[10/28/24, 7:11:03 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: [10/25 5:22 PM] Jessika CIC: There were two, so 35 each.

[10/25 5:40 PM] Matheus: Jessika, could you send me the description of the quantities?

[10/25 5:40 PM] Matheus: How many packages, how many kilos of each item, etc.?

[10/27 5:18 PM] Matheus: Hey everyone, good afternoon. I hope you all had a great weekend. Could you clarify the following questions for me tomorrow morning?

1. Send me the description of the quantities I picked up last week.


2. According to my count, we have 316 packages with nibs and 4 empty ones. But in the description sent to us, you charged for the filling of 396 packages. Could you double-check that for me?


3. I need the invoice for the extra charge of R$70 for the correction of the styrofoam value.



[10/28 8:42 AM] Matheus: Good morning!

[10/28 9:18 AM] Jessika CIC: Good morning! Matheus, everything that was requested was discussed with Emelin. Rework is complicated for our process.

1. I'll send the sales information, but I need you all to align internally and decide who will actually handle things with me, as I really can’t get involved in internal issues.


2. Due to high stock levels, one box was left behind. I’ve just checked, and as a courtesy, we’ve kept the processed items for almost a month for a joint pickup. I ask for your understanding since our storage space is limited.


3. The invoice will be issued for the total sale amount and sent to the registered email; please wait for the financial process.



[10/28 9:18 AM] Jessika CIC: It’s necessary to align who will take care of these points so that information is centralized.

[10/28 9:33 AM] Jessika CIC: BLACK KING - 19-09-2024 - Sale117947 (1).pdf

[10/28 9:33 AM] Jessika CIC: BLACK KING - 17-10-2024 - Sale118065 (2).pdf

[10/28 9:34 AM] Matheus: I’ll respond shortly; I’m in a meeting.

[10/28 9:37 AM] Jessika CIC: 1. Additionally, a signed form was handed to you with the items picked up, with 80 units of nibs packages pending. Much of this is because we do not use cardboard boxes in our process. Did you keep it?

[10/28 10:30 AM] Matheus: Jessika, good morning again.

Let’s go over this. You’ve told me several times that everything I asked for has already been passed on to Emelin, which raises two issues for me. 1. Legally, the service contract was signed between Black King and CIC, including all the signatures you have there, which are mine. So, if I, as the legal representative, have questions about the service provided, shouldn’t they be answered without difficulty? 2. The fact that you repeatedly mention that everything was sent to Emelin suggests that she does indeed have the information but is choosing not to share it. I’m having to come here to get clarifications and resolve doubts. Your relationship with her and sending prints from CIC’s official communication channel to me imply a personal relationship, which, again, is none of my concern. You repeatedly said you don’t want to get involved in “internal issues” – a direct quote – but at no point did I bring that to you; I just asked questions. Before a clear and objective response, I was told that this information had already been shared.

P.S.: Please let me know if she continues to reach out to you about logistics.

Regarding the second point, I understand there was a delivery error and one box was left behind. Could you let me know the box's contents and the exact quantity? We noticed a discrepancy in our stock, and we need to cross-check the data to clarify where it is and determine the next steps. Do you have any suggestions to resolve this? Is there a delivery person who could bring it to Ilhéus? How can we manage this so it doesn’t incur extra costs for both sides?

Regarding the third point, thank you. I will inform the other involved parties about including the extra value in the sales invoice that will be issued and sent to my email.

[10/28 10:31 AM] Matheus: Yes, I kept it 🙏

[10/28 10:32 AM] Jessika CIC: Matheus, all my communications with Emelin regarding processing were done through the institutional WhatsApp.

[10/28 10:32 AM] Jessika CIC: Also, the first time I spoke to you, I mentioned that my personal WhatsApp had been mistakenly shared and that I wouldn’t handle matters through it.

[10/28 10:33 AM] Jessika CIC: Yes, there is an internal conflict between you two, and since she was the initially designated contact...

[10/28 10:33 AM] Jessika CIC: you two should discuss it.

[10/28 10:33 AM] Jessika CIC: because my time is being wasted repeating information that has already been aligned and shared.

[10/28 10:33 AM] Jessika CIC: Even justifying the value of a piece of styrofoam, a courtesy was extended to find boxes and storage space to facilitate logistics.

[10/28 10:34 AM] Jessika CIC: So yes, I need you two to resolve it amongst yourselves...

[10/28 10:34 AM] Jessika CIC: and let me know who to handle things with from now on.

[10/28 10:34 AM] Jessika CIC: As for your relationship with her, if she is withholding information or not, I believe that should be resolved between you two.

[10/28 10:38 AM] Jessika CIC: There is nothing personal in my handling of nibs and such, and I haven’t withheld alignment information.

[10/28 10:38 AM] Jessika CIC: I’m about to enter a meeting.

[10/28 10:39 AM] Matheus: No problem, we’ll sort it out. Can you answer the questions I asked above?

[10/28 10:39 AM] Jessika CIC: I only sent the screenshot for that reason, but I shouldn’t have. Again, please align who will handle this and inform me, as it’s not viable to repeat information that’s already been aligned.

[10/28 10:39 AM] Jessika CIC: I’ve already sent everything, dear.

[10/28 10:39 AM] Jessika CIC: Only the invoice is pending, which the finance department will issue. We need to wait for the process.

[10/28 10:40 AM] Matheus: I asked for your suggestion on the merchandise left behind.

[10/28 10:41 AM] Jessika CIC: There was no loss, Matheus. As explained, the high stock led to one box being left as a courtesy. The 80 units remained.

[10/28 10:42 AM] Jessika CIC: Usually, we only have a delivery person for chocolates. I’ll check and get back to you. If we manage to get a delivery person, where should it be delivered?

[10/28 10:43 AM] Matheus: It wasn’t your need to justify the charged amount; it was mine. I was questioned several times about the higher amount, and as we’re dealing with investors, there is a compliance that must be strictly followed. Even if we make mistakes, it’s just a matter of reporting them so that everything is documented.

[10/28/24, 7:29:16 AM] Gary Teh: Am I right to understand that CIC will be delivering the box containing 80Kg to us or are we expected to pick it up? 

If we are expected to pick it up then perhaps do it during the trip when you are going to pick up the 138 bars from martinus since it is along the way

Also during that trip, stop over at Emelin’s place to pick up the stuff at her place ‎<This message was edited>
[10/28/24, 8:15:55 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: CIC is currently verifying what they have on hand and will create a timeline to track the entire process. They promised to email me. She just mentioned she identified 60 packages, so I’m waiting for that email to clarify the facts. Once informed, I’ll arrange the best way to retrieve them.

Regarding the scale, I’ll look for where I can buy one and bring it to the warehouse as soon as possible.

For Martinus, I’ll reach out to coordinate the pickup.

Lastly, regarding Emelin, please ask her to send the material she has to me at the following address: Av. Lomanto Junior, 1566, Pontal - first floor, during business hours.
[10/28/24, 8:22:02 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: @14153000019  Jessika sent me an email that I forwarded to you.

I will be giving you a call if I don’t hear anything from you by then 🙂🙏
[10/29/24, 5:06:40 AM] Gary Teh: By deduction, here are the two different scenarios

*Scenario A*
- if CIC states that all the 8 ounce bags were packed into 3 boxes and nowhere else

- ⁠you have checked again and find that the two boxes with you only have 158 in each of them (_a total of 316 bags_)

- ⁠both boxes are at full capacity (_cannot add anymore bags_) 

- ⁠you did not load any loose bags of Kraft pouches in your car but only the 2 boxes

Then the outstanding 20 bags must still be on their premise 

_Resolution_
Case is to be escalated to Christiano. 

This is no longer a matter that can be resolved at Jessica’s level in CIC

If case still cannot be resolved at Christino’s level then you will need to inform him that it will be further escalated to the federal police level. 

*Scenario B*
You have checked that there are indeed 168 bags in each box

And you have a total of 336 bags in both boxes 

_Resolution_
Case closed ‎<This message was edited>

[10/30/24, 5:09:15 AM] Gary Teh: Let me know once you finished the inventory check tomorrow and verified there are 138 bars in the boxes 

I will do the pix thereafter 🙂🙏
[10/30/24, 5:20:11 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 as part of new process to ensure proper hand over of inventory and accountability 

When you receive the items that Emelin is going to drop off at the warehouse make sure to do the following 

1. do an inventory count

2. take a photo of the inventory received 

3. submit to our guild channel the photo along with the inventory count outcome you did within 2 business days

4. this process should be followed for all inventory that are dropped off in your warehouse 

5. for inventory you pickup from factory facility conduct steps 1-3 on their factory premise

🙂🙏

Load 2 bags of 10kg cacao nibs into a box

Siscomex DUE required 

Ship them to @16468233438 warehouse location in San Francisco

[10/30/24, 6:43:14 AM] Gary Teh: @557391090002 

*USA shipment 3*

- 20 bars of 500grams cacao mass
- ⁠45 bags of 8 ounce Kraft pouch cacao nibs 

Load them in one box

Ship them to @16468233438 warehouse location in San Francisco 

- Siscomex DUE required. 
- ⁠FDA prior notice to be issued 

Check with post office if these two items can be placed and shipped in one box done via one DUE since they have the same NCM code

[10/30/24, 7:06:48 AM] Gary Teh: If having these two items in one box is an issue for siscomex DUE then split into two boxes 

- USA Shipment 3.A - 88 bags
- ⁠ USA Shipment 3.B - 40 bars

Let me know what the final configuration is so that I can issue the right FDA prior notice
[10/30/24, 7:06:59 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: The box that will be used to ship the bars will need to be made of styrofoam or have some type of thermal insulation. Currently, we have two large styrofoam boxes and three smaller ones, which are still large enough to ship only 20 bars. What do you suggest we should do?
[10/30/24, 7:08:26 AM] Gary Teh: How many bars is in one styrofoam box? 

Is 46 bars (138/3)?

If so, perhaps ship one styrofoam box as a standalone for *USA shipment 3.B* ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/24, 7:10:33 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: That's correct
[10/30/24, 7:10:38 AM] Gary Teh: Then for *USA shipment 3.A* ship 88 bags of 8 ounce cacao nibs
[10/30/24, 7:11:46 AM] Gary Teh: I will issue FDA prior notice for 

- USA shipment 2
- ⁠USA shipment 3.A
- ⁠USA shipment 3.B
[10/30/24, 7:19:27 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: It comfortably holds 46. If we add more, I believe it might damage or even break some bars.
[10/30/24, 7:26:04 AM] Gary Teh: Just keep to 46bars

That is around 23kg

Make sure to use the Carreois package that takes 18 days instead of 12 days

That eats into our profit margin by 3USD a kg, making the whole shipment unprofitable as soon as it arrives in USA ‎<This message was edited>

[11/2/24, 4:42:02 AM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: Good morning, updates on logistics. It seems that SISCOMEX faced some server instabilities yesterday. I tried to issue the DUE on Thursday night, but my login didn’t go through. I tried again yesterday morning and had the same issue. Later in the day, I managed to log in and fill out the issuance form, but public services had already ended their operations. Today is a national holiday in Brazil, so I will only be able to send the shipments on Monday, probably at 9 a.m. when the post office opens.

- mercadore libre packing box
- ⁠foam box for holding bar 

Please do indicate too which box is associated with which correios tracking number 

That way we can track DAO asset that has moved from one warehousing location to another

[11/4/24, 8:02:16 PM] Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop: @14153000019  I couldn’t send it because I had an issue with my cell phone. The battery overheated and swelled. I was left without communication or access to my information in the afternoon. I’m not sure if it was due to carrying the boxes or overheating, but I was without communication until a technician managed to activate my phone with a spare battery. Today, during my lunch break, I’ll go to the post office again to send the two shipments.

I am curious to explore this

[11/5/24, 12:49:43 PM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, Agroverse is unlike a traditional consumer brand where everything needs to look prim and proper, thus super polished when it is presented to the consumers 

It’s a community project and its marketing should resemble more reality TV than regular content marketing.

Reality TV programs like apprentice, survivor and alone from a production quality perspective lacks when compared to Hollywood movies like Matrix and Avengers

However what attracts people to watch the content is the drama inherent within the community during the course of operations 

Difficulties encountered during logistics as well as disagreements between different folks fall under the drama category ‎<This message was edited>

[11/5/24, 1:45:17 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes asking @557381610166 about keys to @557391090002 warehouse
[11/5/24, 2:18:53 PM] Gary Teh: It is now the end of 2 business days, and I spent the final 25 minutes of the second business trying to get through to @557391090002 via WhatsApp in the form of 20 calls

I was not able to get through to him regarding status updates on the 2 boxes which he stated he will ship out today 

_PS: from my personal perspective, it’s past two business days as according to the community warehouse manager SLA agreement, I have doubts this operating structure where worldwide fulfillment is handled in Bahia would work if there are frequent delays beyond 2 business days as per our SLA requirements_

_i will try calling him again tomorrow at 12pm sharp Brazilian time tomorrow to get a status update and will continue doing so everyday till Friday_ 

_If I still can’t get through to him by this Friday at 12pm, then my concern is no longer just about the ability of the Brazilian warehouse to meet the shipment fulfillment requirements but about a potential return rug pull scenario which is common in the Web3 space_

_the saving grace is since I am just 2 hours away from the Brazilian warehousing location, we should be able to mobilize local legal infrastructure to retrieve our DAO assets if and when it actually is a Rug Pull_

_If and when the scenario does degrade into a rug pull at Friday 1pm (5 business days), the entire DAO (ala all token holders) will be informed_

🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>

[11/6/24, 12:19:19 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes reminding @557391090002 of the clause for 50% penalty for failing the 4 business day threshold in the SLA agreement sent to him

[11/6/24, 12:29:17 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes reminding @557391090002 we are still awaiting for him to sign the SLA document 

The expected outcome is that if we do not received a signed copy by Friday, we will need to act based on the assumption that the brazilian shipment fulfillment is not going to be performant at the level required by customers worldwide making purchases from us and we should plan as according 

_PS: my proposed course of action if that were to be the case is to then ship out all the inventory from the Brazilian facility prior to my departure to our warehouse in San Francisco and abandon the Brazilian facility as well as the European and Japanese market_ ‎<This message was edited>

And also propose to them that we will need to seek another exporting partner that is performance compliant based according to USA standards before we can proceed with the building out of Robert’s supply chain for the annual export of 18 tons of cacao butter ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/24, 1:12:17 AM] Gary Teh: I am foreseeing the scenario where it is the USA government FDA auditor making the call to this number and not getting an adequate response  

That will translate to a huge disruption with the supply chain on the USA side especially for Robert’s 18 ton per year volume as and when we receive a recall notice ‎<This message was edited>
[11/6/24, 7:10:57 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes with @557391090002 on the phone

- immediate status update for all matters pertaining to SLA 

- ⁠responsiveness for SLA and legal matters pertaining FDA auditing. _No more 20 phone calls and still not picking up. Huge negative implications for FDA and customer concerns_

- ⁠ensure inventory updates are promptly and accurately reported
 
- ⁠signed copy of the SLA agreement by Friday ‎<This message was edited>

[12/4/24, 1:05:06 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438

- Could we put all the cacao almonds into a new container - please find one
- As for all the powdery stuff in the box could we swept them back into the bags. They are cacao husk which we are going to be making cacao tea with on the 16th
[12/4/24, 1:07:31 PM] Gary Teh: I spent 5 minutes giving feedback to @16468233438 on what to do with the contents within the box
[12/4/24, 1:09:22 PM] Val Lapidus: I'll transfer the almonds.  But the powder is a small amount.  And it would be unsanitary to put it back
[12/4/24, 1:09:25 PM] Val Lapidus: I'm going to dispose of it
[12/4/24, 1:09:33 PM] Val Lapidus: You still have the full bag and its contents
[12/4/24, 3:37:30 PM] Val Lapidus: Spent 1 and 1/2 hours. Unpackaging, documenting and repackaging.  Suggest on next. Send that you double bag or even triple bag any items? I found holes in the bags. I'm assuming they are a result of the poor handling of the package

[12/5/24, 5:34:23 PM] Val Lapidus: it came before thanksgiving but i was out of town
[12/5/24, 7:37:24 PM] Gary Teh: @16468233438 can I get your help to figure out a simple recipe for making drinks out of the cacao husk? 

Been trying to calibrate on my side but ran out of supplies also the kitchen in the hostel that I just moved into is lagging
[12/5/24, 9:42:21 PM] Val Lapidus: That's the stuff you sent me right?
[12/6/24, 3:49:07 AM] Gary Teh: Yes. The stuff that spilled 

We need to get the recipe figured out by 17th when we serve it at the edge and node where we will sell some bags of our cacao nibs as well
