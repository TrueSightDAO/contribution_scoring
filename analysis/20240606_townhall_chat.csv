Gary Teh,"Been thinking through our Agroverse Ledgers (_AGL1 and AGL2 so far_)

Our per unit cost gets lower when the shipment size larger. 

There are three constraints we are dealing with 

- Being able to test the market at the lower price point before we ship in a larger shipping volume 

- ‚Å† The lag time between when the order is placed and when the shipment arrives at the port

- ‚Å† interest of Investors in each AGL is taken care of

I‚Äôm starting to think of each AGL as its own special purpose vehicle (SPV) 

To get around the above constrains, it makes sense to allow one AGL to lend inventory (_cacao_) to another AGL while charging an interest rate on the inventory on loan. Loan interest is to be repaid in inventory (_Cacao_) 

Interest rate will be at the prevailing standard rate that DAO has voted on. 

AGL3 can also opt to repay in fiat at the exchange rate imposed by AGL2 

Example: AGL2 lends 5 KG of cacao nips to AGL3. Cacao nips are paid by AL3 to AGL3 one month later. Total amount repaid is 5.07KG of cacao nibs 

*Benefits*

- AGL3 gets to test the market at the new lower price point before the inventory arrives

- AGL2 gets their inventory refreshed. Shelf life is extended.

- ‚Å†AGL2 get more inventory under management by offering the service to AGL3

Gary Teh,"my thoughts on funding matters

When deploying capital it‚Äôs either to exploit some alpha or some beta 

- alpha - some element about a commercial venture that was not there but will at some point be there 

- ‚Å†beta - some element about a commercial venture that used to be there and will likely return. 

Regarding Agroverse, it would be more likely a story of Alpha if it does come to pass . 

What was priorly Emptiness is ends up getting occupied by some entity that got collectively summoned from the Ethers by the community 

*_Purpose of AGL1*_
- prove it is possible to bring in a commercial shipment of cacao nibs across the border without issues from FDA (_in my luggage_)

- ‚Å†prove it is possible to identify a viable product configuration and some evidence of a workable distribution channel (_night market organized by @16468233438_)

- ‚Å†payload: 5KG

*_Purpose of AGL2*_
- prove we can bring in a shipment via a freighting company 

- ‚Å†prove it is possible to identify a distribution channel where we can conduct repeated sales (_Sunday market channel proven by @16468233438 via TyTyCoCo and via our website setup by @557191035605 and @918017107841 and offline tasting events by Gary_)

- payload: 100KG


_*Purpose of AGL3_*

- Prove we can further scale known distribution channels by operating 2 Sunday market stores 

- ‚Å†Prove we can drive more sales via our website by systematically conducting more offline tasting events 

- ‚Å†Payload: 1000KG

After this afternoon‚Äôs conversation with the folks from StartEngine, from a financial engineering standpoint point there are two possible ways to finance AGL3. 

One is via what we have already voted into effect, float a separate set of RWA tokens to finance the shipping of AGL3 into USA. Seems the cleanest but might not be very interesting for folks with lots of capital to deploy and want some stakes for the *_home run*_, because we boot their positions out once we have proven we could scale our distribution 

The other method is to allow them to inject their capital directly into TrueSight DAO Entity at a pre-money valuation of 1.9 million USD (_what we have all already sunk in so far_) where they can join the rest of us for the *_home run*_.

Via the second method, instead of TrueSight DAO being a manager of investors fund to finance the shipment, TrueSight DAO itself finance the shipment.

For second method of fund injection, we need a more comprehensive capital deployment schedule on how USD500k could be immediately deployed if and when provided and what is the expected valuation of the organization as a whole once this new capital has been fully deployed

_PS: you don‚Äôt go to investors asking for a huge amount of capital injection and giving pay bills and live comfortably as your only reason. ü§¶_

One way we could scale @120363044028036610@g.us via this dimension to offer a highly differentiated offering versus the other cacao suppliers is to partner up with an entire network of cacao ceremony shamans in the USA. 

They offer the experience in their locality while we do the following 

- underwrite the legal risk of dealing with FDA

- ‚Å†financing to bring down per unit cost of cacao supplies by importing in volume 

- ‚Å†logistics of getting the cacao out of the Amazon rainforest and getting them shipped to the shamans 

- ‚Å†proper hedging to ensure stable prices 

The outcome is a harmonious symbiosis 

Recording of their cacao ceremony will also help power our content marketing initiatives 

We will know for sure if this model will work if and when make a sale to a third cacao ceremony shaman

Vlatko Gigov,"to vote on matters: 

- context should be provided
- ‚Å†analysis on alternatives 
- ‚Å†scenarios anticipated

Voting on trivial matters diminishes the value of the vote and the wisdom of the Town Hall. Each guild prepares a specific proposal if they want to call in the town hall and it‚Äôs decision power. 

Radical transparency is a great tool when used appropriately. Radical inclusion only works when everyone is performing to the expected levels of commitment. If these conditions are not met, in my personal opinion the collective disarrays. Incentives and expectations are the driving force behind everyone‚Äôs decision. ‚Äé<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"After spending three years working with the DAO framework, I‚Äôm inclined to conclude that direct democracies is  *_NOT_* a suitable analogy to use when referencing DAOs. This is namely because

- DAO participants do not depend on the DAO for their livelihood and they do not experience hardship when DAO fails. (_when Ukraine is invaded, Ukrainians die. When DAO fails, no one will feel the pinch_)
 
- ‚Å†there is no yearly taxation requirements for continued participation (_totally open if we want to vote into effect yearly subscription fees for rights to vote in townhall_)

- ‚Å†there is not much of a common pool of resource that is large enough where people feel the desire to steward over (_problem will get resolved when we start charging yearly subscription for continued rights to policy voting access_)

So while this document is a good share on how direct democracies work, it is not applicable for DAOs.
