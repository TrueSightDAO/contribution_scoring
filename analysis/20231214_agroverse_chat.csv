I know the technology full stack from end to end as well as how each layer makes money that is why I am so anal who owns which layer of the stack

If done wrongly it’s like the bunch of us spent all out money to go around the world to build a successful business and once the business is built we hand off the passive income to 1Inch network on a silver platter while we own nothing of it

That to me is just stupid

Matheus Reis - Bahia Coop,"As it is a shade-tolerant plant, it grows well in understories and thin forests, making it an extremely conservationist crop for soil, fauna and flora. Little mechanized, it is a culture that provides a high degree of employment generation. It found in the south of Bahia one of the best soils and climate for its expansion.

The State of Bahia is the largest producer in Brazil, but its production capacity was reduced by up to 60% with the advent of witches' broom, caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, currently Moniliophthora perniciosa.

The cocoa production system in Bahia is known as cabruca, an agroforestry system, where the fruit is grown under trees in the Atlantic Forest, having great importance for the preservation of the forest.

what are the disadvantages to using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product
ChatGPT
Using homeless people in the marketing and sales of a new product can raise ethical and practical concerns. Here are some of the disadvantages:

Exploitation: It can be seen as exploiting vulnerable individuals for commercial gain. Homeless people may be desperate for money and may agree to participate in marketing campaigns under coercive or exploitative conditions.

Stigmatization: Involving homeless individuals in marketing and sales may unintentionally perpetuate stereotypes and stigmas associated with homelessness, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions of this group.

Dignity and Privacy: It may compromise the dignity and privacy of homeless people. Marketing and sales activities often involve public exposure, which can infringe on their personal space and comfort.

Unintended Consequences: Using homeless people in marketing may draw negative attention or backlash, leading to unintended consequences for both the brand and the individuals involved.

Ethical Concerns: Ethical questions can arise about whether the compensation and support provided to homeless participants are fair and adequate. This includes concerns about fair wages, working conditions, and access to healthcare and social services.

Short-Term Solution: Using homeless individuals in marketing and sales does not address the root causes of homelessness, which are primarily related to housing, employment, mental health, and social safety nets. It may be seen as a short-term, superficial solution to a complex social issue.

Dependence on Exploitation: Relying on homeless people for marketing and sales may perpetuate a system where vulnerable individuals become dependent on such opportunities instead of receiving appropriate support and assistance.

Risk to Brand Reputation: Associating a brand with the use of homeless people in marketing can lead to backlash, harm brand reputation, and result in boycotts or negative public sentiment.

Legal and Regulatory Concerns: There may be legal and regulatory challenges, such as ensuring that all participants are adults who have provided informed consent. Employing homeless individuals without addressing labor and employment laws could lead to legal issues.

Lack of Expertise: Homeless individuals may not have the necessary expertise or training for marketing and sales roles, potentially affecting the effectiveness of the campaign and customer experience.

It is important for businesses and organizations to consider these disadvantages carefully and explore alternative ways to support homeless individuals that are more ethical and sustainable. These may include partnering with charities and organizations, providing job training and housing assistance, or actively participating in efforts to address homelessness in their communities.",Contributed Human Effort, 96,20231030

Val Lapidus,"When we go to events or talk about our product. There are three key talking points, none of those talking points are on the website, and they are the most interesting aspect of this project.  I'd like to work on getting those points into the main site.  The three talking points are:

6% versus 36% to farmers
Cabruca farming method

‎",Contributed Human Effort, 0,20231106
Gary Teh,"If it’s selling hot choclate, you are correct

the bulk of the consensus is the guild just wants to stick to nibs 

Any processing beyond the nibs stage, it is independent of the dao 

The exception would be it is a product that was created in its final form on the farmer’s end and past through DAO network for distribution in USA

The model becomes cleaner in this regard

Rather than becoming a manufacturer we stick to being a distributor 

Otherwise a lot of the value captured along the supply chain needs to stay with us to pay for all these transformation expenses instead of passing directly to the farmers and the cooperatives where they should be ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"Also an insight that became apparent about our DAO after testing it against a few category of tasks is that it is most suited for *running light weight and distributed operations* where tasks are self contained and easily tackled by one person as opposed to a *heavy weight and centralized operations* where you need alot of headcount within a short span of time concentrated in one single location

I feel we should play to our strengths instead of our weakness

From this perspective, manufacturing is not going to be our strength. Instead distribution is. 

We are not leveraging enough of our strength in distribution and kind of got alittl distracted in the manufacturing side of things ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231106
Val Lapidus,"I don't necessarily agree with any of that.  But at the same time the only difference for me is that I can no longer tokenize the elements required to execute on the path that I'm currently on. I have full autonomy to execute whatever I want to. But now the guild will simply not share in the profit. If I happen to generate one instead, they will only see the benefit of me purchasing the nibs and potentially me reselling the nibs ‎<This message was edited>",'Contributed Human Effort', 0,20231106

Gary Teh,"Back last year during the prediction market project, I have already setup the initial working prototype type for our own EVM based chain 

The code can be found here 

https://github.com/TrueSightDAO/TrueChain

Didn’t bother to do any further development as that was not the critical action

The critical action was Discovering and Validating a *viable business case* for TrueSight DAO

But as a bootstrap we can have the entries notarized on Ethereum or one of the EVM compatible chains work

At some point it makes sense is to have our own chain and miners as opposed to constantly paying another tech company gas/transaction fees. 

That was what lead to the thinking of *Sunmint* off the grid data center clusters where Our miners will be housed there. 

When I was in Bahia Matheus and Marcel offered their place to run miners. 

Hence it might not even be necessary for us to own the land where SunMint operates on. We run the nodes on the property of the farmers and the gas/transaction fees are paid to them

Gary Teh,"@16468233438 thoughts on 16th arrangement?

*Option 1: 2 pronged operations*

Based on the inputs from Orlantildes, it seems having just one person at the airport will be more than sufficient to load the 100KG on to a rented uhaul van (approximately USD41)

That way you don’t need to be rushing over to the airport and then back to deal with preparing and making available the chocolate drinks for Edge and Node anniversary event

*Option 2: delay the pickup*

Have SeaCoast Logistics pick up the cargo from the airport and then we pick it up after the event. I am sure they will be charging something for that service. Not sure if it is going to be more expensive than USD41. Also judging by the dimensions of each box, I might need to get another transport before I could load the boxes in my car anyways. 

*Follow up*
Let me know your preference by Monday. So that I have enough lead time to arrange for logistics with U-haul services. 🤩",'Contributed Human Effort', 0,20231111

Are you sure it’s exactly 24 hours and not before clock strikes midnight of crossing from 16th to 17th of Nov?

There are some ambiguities there that needs clarification 

*Question 2*
Also SFO is a very large place. 

Which exact terminal or gate should we be heading to to pick up our cargo or are we even supposed going to be heading to the passenger terminals at all? 
Perhaps there is a specific facility we are supposed to report to to claim our cargo when we arrive for the pickup

He is not suitable for sales 

Vendor has autonomy to do what vendor wants to. 

Just think of vendor as a separate company

DAO does not control how vendor handles things internally. 

And neither can DAO control how individual DAO member executes on things 

The only thing that DAO does is surface what can be proposed to DAO members.

@5511982667030 also has R$500 under her management 

For expected payments these three weeks, She can pay from the R$500 under management

If expenses goes beyond R$500 that she has with her right now, she can withdraw money using my credit card at one of their local banks’ ATM 

This way is much cheaper to pay for smaller amounts of expenses incurred in Brazil (less than USD1000) than paying via International Wire transfer

*This is just an interim solution*

I am not expecting any large payments to Brazil side till end of the year. 

If need does arise that we pay for items above USD1000 before year end, it is recommended we do wireless transfer via USA bank 

In the future, beyond the end of this year, if our sales and marketing efforts in USA and Europe is successful and we believe there is a foreseeable need to make constant payments to Brazil suppliers, I will personally fly into Brazil and setup for a dedicated digital bank account and hook it up with PIX.

that way we can make future payments to suppliers in Brazil directly via PIX. Via this route we will not have to incur international bank transfer cost ‎<This message was edited>",'Contributed Human Effort', 30,20231117

https://www.dollartree.com/peel-seal-kraft-paper-envelopes-5-ct/361746



*_Key constrains*_
When combined with shipping labels from stamps.com, total shipping and material cost will be under *_USD6.50*_ which is what we are currently charging for shipping within USA. 

To stay under this cost each package shipped out must be under *_9 ounce*_ to stick to that shipping price 

Also packaging and mailer materials *must not contain plastic* otherwise our brand story of saving the rainforest totally falls apart, which means we will need to totally scrape the story that we are saving the rainforest and tell a totally different brand story for Agroverse. Right now I don’t even know what other compelling story to tell other than this one. 



*Worst case scenario analysis*
if our brand story doesn’t work and nothing sells, we will just donate our entire inventory to GoodWill during *Christmas 2024* and scrape the project. Since expiry date is within a year, we can’t sell it beyond *17th 2024* 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣

Today is the off day for the entire community at the zen center

Randomly bumped into the manager in charge of procuring all the food supplies for the zen kitchen

She gave me an in-depth dive of the _user psychology_ when it comes to stocking their kitchen and how their supply chain works.

She loved the *_story of saving the rainforest*_  as well as the *_earthy design of the package*_ so much, she has offered to help setup an appointment with the *_procurement manager*_ of their Whole Foods supplier. Once we establish a relationship with the _*procurement manager_*, the hope is that they will start buying our cacao nibs in bulk

Also she has offered to drive me over to meet the _*procurement manager*_ once the Whole Foods retailer responses

She also mentioned that the zen center is geographically situated right at the heart of where our target demographic is located

_Rationale_
    - incentivize DAO members to help make introductions 

    - utilizing existing 4 rules rubric based system without introductory additional rules to rubric 

*_Meta Game Logic*_
    _Rule 1_ - full amount of first initial sale in USD from buyer brought in by DAO, same exact amount is issued to DAO member who helped made the sale in TDG

    _Rule 2_ - the above amount is in addition to TDG awarded to DAO member for hours spent bringing in the sale 

    _Rule 3_ - for subsequent sale by buyer, if buyer went directly to DAO. DAO member who brought help brought in this buyer initially for sale will not get any further TDG award based on sale amount

    _Rule 4_ - for subsequent sale, if buyer had to utilize time of that same DAO member before sale could happen (_making phone call_), TDG will be still awarded for time spent by DAO member who is now playing the role of the facilitator and not the sales person

    _Rule 5_ - If DAO member has formed a separate company to buy from DAO, that separate company is treated as a separate buyer. All prior listed rules apply",Rubric classification: Contributed Human Effort, TDGs Issued: 0,20231203
