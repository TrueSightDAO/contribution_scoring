Gary Teh,,"*Key Takeaways on what was discussed with Karen Hardy*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface‚Ä¶
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Aggrieves is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ‚Å†we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit.
