I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

Gary Teh,"@918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform

Gary Teh,"I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space.

But otherwise from what I am aware of so far we need these two additional roles

_Role 1_
a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 9,20231110

Gary Teh,"Happy for anyone who would like to exercise *autonomy* by defining a active role for himself/herself to take on within the scope of Agroverse to join the guild to help advance the  project 🙂🙏

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

_PS: Also please don’t self define a role of being a manager to oversee other members._

_The guild size is small enough that members should be able to self manage and self execute once given the instructions manual on how to operate some functions_ 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231110
Gary Teh,"I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

Gary Teh,"*Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown,0,20231113

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.
