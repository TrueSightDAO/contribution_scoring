I sampled some Ecuadorian pallets a few week ends ago. Those were really really smooth. Right on the other end of the acidity spectrum.

Also we need to ensure the packaging has aluminum lining on the inside of the packaging otherwise the plastic taste is just going to ruin the taste of the cacao nibs. And make it taste 🤮

Gary Teh,"@918017107841 once you have the new site ready with the onboarding flow  in place, let’s schedule a session to demonstrate it to Hans Martin

It’s perfect for what he described yesterday 

Also Micheal from Peace on Snow was originally surfaced by @33652866472 as someone whom we should talk to for our Swiss Association needs as Peace on Snow is a Swiss association 

My original intention when I reached out earlier in the year was to figure out how to tap into that piece of infrastructure. I did not get any response then

But seems like the universe got everything ready and presented it on a silver platter for us 

If implemented properly Hans Martin will end up onboarding the entire Davos community on to the platform

Gary Teh,"I have shared that we are transitioning to this new  _4 rule rubric system_ with the core team at the *House of Balance*. (Hans Martin originally invited me to that group because they were keen to replicate the system we have in place back last year.)

They seem receptive to it. we were trying to implement a variant of our _legacy rubric system_ in *House of Balance* over the past 12 months. 

Unfortunately, the need for a dedicated _accountant/subjective judge_ in the legacy rubric system was too much of an overhead and it didn’t really scale well as I got dragged into the operations side of things in @120363044028036610@g.us 

Once we have trialed tested this new *4 rules rubric system* in both _TrueSight DAO_ and _Peace on Snow_ and it shows to work, we can arrange a session to do a mini-trial with the House of Balance folks as well. 

If it works when rolled out to the *House of Balance* then we could basically roll it out to all the other communities attempting to pursue social enterprises as the core of their DNA but hampered with limited ability to gather fiat funding for their needs 🤔

This is especially true in the entire import and export business. 

I believe if we brought about 100% transparency in this vertical, we will greatly disrupt the space.

a outreach marketing specialist who will take an active role to commit time on a weekly basis to pitch our cacao nibs to retailers

_role 2_
Marketing outreach specialist who can reach out to influencers to share our stuff to their followers ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 9,20231110

*Autonomy* is one of our core values

Gary Teh,"I believe once our DAO gains the ability to certify a foreign supplier under the FSVP program, we will be able to simply pay a visit to a selected manufacturing facility in Colombia, give it our blessing, add it to our Agroverse network and then start importing supplies from it. 

but first, we need to be able to shortlist ones that are qualified for exports by the Colombian government before we engage one of our DAO's FSVP qualified individual to undertake the inspection.

I believe if we go the extend of notarizing all our FSVP inspections on the blockchain we can start establishing a open database of foreign suppliers than any enterprising retailer based in the USA can readily choose from to co-manufacture their products with. 

And the primary difference between this database of suppliers versus the other existing ones out there is that they are all USFDA FSVP validated, streamlined and import ready. This also means that small scale retailers don't need to go through all the bullshit that we navigated these past six months before they can start bringing their produce into USA.

Gary Teh,"*Insights Michael shared during the evening session today*

    - senior sales people are hired because of the collection of relationships they accumulated through the years within their industry. 

    - establishing relationships with the person within the procurement department is most critical tasks any sales person must do

    - T J Rodgers (former CEO cypress semi-conductor) was known to immediately fire employees on the spot as soon as he realizes their integrity is questionable. if some aspects of the operations they oversaw failed and the person in charge could clearly explained why it failed, then the learning was done and iteration could be done quickly. However if some aspects of the operations failed and the person in charge chose to mask things up, then the whole organization suffers.

    - The semi-conductor industry which operates based on razor thin margins is generally a very brutal space to operate in. ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown,0,20231113
Gary Teh,"Speaking of brutal, Open Sea just laid off 50% of their employees 2 days ago.

https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-lays-off-staff-severance-version-2-0-launch

As an individual operating within such an environment, you really don’t want to be caught on your back foot when the company you have spent many years working for goes through one of those usual rounds of lay offs. 

Being stuck with a crazy mortgage to pay as well as kids to support is the worst of the worst kind of situation. I happened to bump into quite a few folks within that category. I am sure the stress level has been especially high for them this period of time.

Gary Teh,"Additional insights from Ray Wu (Y-Combinator Alumni) 

*key insights*
    - tech scene is so abysmal right now no one wants to think about it that is why a lot of tech folks are looking into the FnB space 

    - VCs don’t really do much except _sell the money_ they took from someone else (_Limited Partners_) for hopefully at least a 3X return to keep their job. They market themselves as _value adding_ to try sell their money at a premium to unsuspecting founders but actually not much value add in hindsight

- people come in at seed and pre-seed with the belief in the _greater fool theory_ that someone will buy out their position at Series A for a 3X return. 

- bulk of the rich folks belong to the NATO category by default (_no action talk only_). See them for what they are. Tap on their network of relationships if applicable otherwise be judicious in deployment of operator’s (_person who actually executes_) time beyond what is necessary to maintain the relationship ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"I am aware that the cooperative we are working with in Brazil have been actively exploring this concept with a supposed tech solutions provider while I was there

Unfortunately based on what I understood later on, the tech solutions provider ghosted on them... (_ghosting seem to be a prevalent phenomena in the web3 space… I had even offered to meetup with the tech solutions provider to explore collaborate while I was there… but to no avail…_) 

The upside is, once we have proven the end to end model for Agroverse that door is right now left wide open for us to step right in to fill up that gaping hole left by the tech solutions provider. 

According to our new _4 rules rubric system_ we should in principle award governance token to the tech solutions provider that ghosted on the cooperative. 

This is because he did spend time educating the market on our behalf… he just did not deliver on his promise… 🤔🤣

Gary Teh,"Something I observed about the way work is structured around these work session teams at the Zen monastery I have been studying these past few days

*_simplicity*_
The task at each position is simple and well defined. Which allows easy build up of muscle memory after 3-4 iteration by a person executing that the role

Also the number of roles are very very limited since the overall scope of operations was deliberately kept to a minimal as is the signature characteristic of Zen inspired designs 

*_ease of role switching*_
Since these roles are designed to be simple, anyone could easily swap in and swap out of those roles (_which happens on a weekly basis_). 

This also makes it possible for a guest student who has just joined the community for a 2 week period to quickly get into the hang of any assigned role after 2-3 days and start being productive by day 4

*_pairing*_
Someone more experienced in a role is paired with someone new to a role. 

I have observed similar process before in engineering teams called _pair programming_ where an engineer more experienced with a codebase is paired up with an incoming engineer that is new to the codebase to quickly onboard the new engineer 

*_redundancy*_
There is a healthy level of redundancy built into the system design. 

7-8 people are loaded into a scope that could be easily handled by 3-4 people ‎<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"Well.. seems it’s less intense here than the *_Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat_* which clocks *_10 hours per day*_. 🤣

Based data collected from the past seven days, it is an average of only 5 hours of sitting and walking meditation per day. Plus another 5 hours of meditation while actively attending to simple chores around the temple and the farm.

One thing I am really curious would be to volunteer as a server for one of the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat once I get back to the Bay Area again after my upcoming trip to Davos. 

That will help give first hand knowledge on how the logistic side of Vipassana retreat works (_heard from @14153096839 that no one is allowed to talk there even as a server_) 

And then as a third data point, finally attend the workshop conducted at the Spiritual Science Research Foundation in Goa as recommended by @41765663130

Gary Teh,"*_Observation at the Zen monastery*_

I had the opportunity to study how the *_sangha*_ (_monastic community_) works 

Specific forms occur at recurring specific time of the day, these are those:

    - communal food
    - study time 
    - meditation time 
    - housekeeping time 
    - operating chores 

The only thing that is compulsory for all to engage in is housekeeping 

As for the rest whether the residents all turn up for them it is up to the exercise of their *_autonomy*_

For residents who are keen the schedule is visibly displayed on the way 

I noticed not all monastic residents show all the time for all meditation or study sessions

But since all residents were self selecting they are generally motivated to follow the schedule which is designed to enhance their spiritual practice 

_*How that translates to DAO*_
Feel free to come up with a schedule and a meeting venue 

If DAO members are keen they can turn up 

If DAO members are not keen they don’t need to turn up 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231207

Gary Teh,"I am exercising my *Autonomy* by minimizing my FaceTime for now

When I look at my personal historical data collected over the past 12 months, these FaceTime sessions somehow always occur right when US stock market starts trading. 

The personal cost (_disrupted trades amounting to more than USD20K_) of these FaceTime far outweighs the value generated so far 🤔

I conclude asynchronous communication works best for me. 

Also asynchronous communications allows the space for the messenger to deliver the full message and then ample time for me to fully read and contemplate on the message before replying

Finally side observation these past three weeks, when I deliberately step back, it creates the space that allows other DAO members to step forward.

Rather than attempt to sell it perhaps just order as much as possible and then store them somewhere in our decentralized warehousing facility  

Buyers will come knocking on the door at some point when they realize our prices have became competitive just because of market price changes

Then we can start offloading the cacao from our network of warehouses

DAO members get compensated for storage 

Based on my understanding from the folks from the cooperative, Cacao butter can technically be store forever 

Also an active sales team is no longer needed. We just need yo find more folks who are keen to offer their place for cacao storage purposes ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20231210

Gary Teh,"DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault’s treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ … aka both have became equally broke… 🤣

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them.

Gary Teh,"My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs…

Here is a good analogy… 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don’t do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ⁠surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ⁠surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ⁠person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ⁠for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ⁠when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ⁠signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ⁠noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ⁠For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ⁠For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ⁠the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‎<This message was edited>

_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_ 

John and Jack are sitting in the kitchen. 

Jack says to John don’t eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?! 

It is Time to do nothing 🤯

- *key action*: missing!?! 

- ⁠*qualifier*: don’t pluck blue apples

As Jack and John are about to go to the garden to gather 6 apples to make their apple pie for sale, Jack points specifically to the weird looking apple tree with blue apples hanging from it and says gather all apples except those blue ones on that tree.
