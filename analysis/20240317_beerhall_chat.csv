_PS: I was thinking if everyone in the DAO migrated over to the House of Balance there would technically be no further need to maintain TrueSight DAO or any of its channels_

_the values are quite aligned though the set of activities pursued are somewhat different_

_So long as no attempt is made to pursue any commercial enterprises, there is technically no need to maintain the tokens if everything is gift and donation based._

_At some point, we should even consider donating what is left of our USDT treasury to the community events they seek to organize once a year_ ‚Äé<This message was edited>

Gary Teh,"DAO should not deploy network resources (_member contributions_) for initiatives without the goal of at minimal recouping the same amount back to our vault‚Äôs treasury in one form or another if DAO intends to self sustain. 

*_compassion*_ based contribution only works to the extend the *_level of suffering experienced by DAO*_ for not receiving member contribution is at least an order of magnitude higher than the *_level of suffering experienced by contributor*_

When member resource levels gets depleted to the same level as DAO, member stops *_compassion based contribution*_ ‚Ä¶ aka both have became equally broke‚Ä¶ ü§£

On the flip side, if member observes the value of their contribution gets significantly amplified when these are directed to DAO, they will be motivated to want to contribute more, this is primarily driven by the sense of achievement they feel from having made a huge impact with a relatively reasonable amount of contribution from them.

Gary Teh,"My thoughts regarding all these recent discussions about commission from sales of cacao nibs‚Ä¶

Here is a good analogy‚Ä¶ 

All these chefs in the kitchen are spending alot of cycles debating on the size of the shovel the gardeners working on the farm in the backyard should be using 

Meanwhile none of the chefs in the kitchen have  ever the intent of actually rolling up their sleeves to dig a hole in the farm using the shovel or have ever done so. 

Definitely an entertaining experience for everyone in the household to have but not really good use of DAO members time and resources 

After observing the above described episode and then observing how things were done in the Zen monastery as well as recalling how logistics in the Singapore military was ran during my 2.5 years there see below. 

*Key takeaways*
- saying don‚Äôt do this or that, but not stating clearly what exactly needs to be done is not helpful. Except for the purpose of entertainment during free time, it almost definitely a waste of time reading the text

- ‚Å†surface rules that are objective, measurable and positive 

- ‚Å†surface actual rules that could be compiled together to define a recipe/protocol/policy that could be executed step by step, tested and then fine tuned

- ‚Å†person surfacing rules for compilation into recipe/protocol/policy should be one who have actually rolled up sleeves and dug a hole or is about to start digging a hole with a shovel. definitely not by folks who are solely intent on just hanging around in the kitchen speculating what size of hole that is to be dug on the farm and what size shovel 

- ‚Å†for everyone to feel included, once the gardeners have surfaced the recipe/protocol/policy for voting, everyone feel free to cast your vote 

- ‚Å†when someone surfaces a rule, critically access the signal from the noise. 

- ‚Å†signal: from person who is truly intent on digging the hole or has already dug one. 

- ‚Å†noise: from person who is just speculating and has no intention of doing so

*Examples of what are rules and what are not*

_Valid proposed rule_
- for each additional 1 centimeters of width in a hole, the depth needs to be increased by 2 centimeters. 
- ‚Å†For holes deeper than 10 centimeters, please use large shovel. 
- ‚Å†For holes lesser than 10 centimeters, please use small shovel. 


_Invalid proposed rules_
- the hole needs to be big. (_what do you mean by big_)
- ‚Å†the hole needs to be small (_what do you mean by small_) ‚Äé<This message was edited>

_scenario of qualifier with no actual action associated_

Jack says to John don‚Äôt eat the blue apple. (_Negative statement_)

At this point John will be totally mind boggled. 

John probably thinks what Blue Apple!?! is Jack say a Zen Koan to him and trying him gain spiritual enlightenment!?!

Records to be tokenized will be approved by one of the *_10 Governors*_ system appointed each season. There will be a user interface provided where governors can indicate their approval

Once governor indicates approval, TDG tokens on TrueChain will be automatically issued to DAO member‚Äôs Metamask wallet address on file 

DAO member can opt to keep their TDG holdings on TrueChain or request for DAO to have their TDG holdings transferred to either the Solana or Ethereum chain

Their action will by default provide us with the following details

- email address of farmer
- ‚Å†Date time stamp (embedded in email header)
- GPS location of tree (embedded in photo attachment)
- ‚Å†image of tree (embedded in photo attachment) ‚Äé<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 6,20231220

From farmers, the prices have been varying from 80kes to 100kes per kg of the raw product. I will share a photo from our farm.

However, depending on the level of value addition the bags in supermarkets go for 600kes to over 800kes for 250grams. This value add is typically roasting and salting.

For the very premium ones, they go for as high as 250 kes for 30grams.

Gary Teh,"I am noticing a recurring pattern‚Ä¶ 

ideas and discussions happening in DAO being taken and incorporated into members own independent project 

The most recent one that got surfaced by @41799155602 this morning was by Satheesh (the Ahan project) which borrowed from RnD materials done in Agroverse. The Ahan deck was sent to @41799155602 for fund raising purposes. 

Until @41799155602 surfaced this, I had no idea Satheesh was approaching supporters of Agroverse project to seek financing for an alternate project that had borrowed RnD materials from Agroverse.

This copy and paste phenomena seems to be common in the realms of open source too

_PS: at this point, I am leaning towards being skeptical about the DAO model as a *equitable way* to crowd source for resource to build community projects as the same flaws which exist in open source software operating models are starting to surface in DAO ecosystem as well_

_microsoft for years have been copying and pasting code created in open source projects to build up their OS. Bulk of the market capitalization ended up getting attributed to Microsoft and none of it ever end up getting attributed to these open source efforts_

_as @5511982667030 correctly identified DAO seems to be like a leaky bucket in terms of value generation and capture‚Ä¶ value is generated by collective effort but seems to keep getting captured elsewhere_

_I am right now holding off on pouring more personal resources into this leaky bucket until a better alternate variant is discovered‚Ä¶_

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

Vlatko Gigov,"Indeed. Looking at it from a macro perspective and how the majority of synthetic/petrochemicals products/by products come from China, the supply chain aspect will be affected.

Prior to the listing IEO participants can be given the chance to by at $0.80/TDG. Have a cap on the IEO say 75% of allocated tokens.The remaining tokens can be used for co-marketing activities and the liquidity for the trading pair.

We, people of diverse religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions throughout the world, hereby establish the United Religions Initiative to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings.

We respect the uniqueness of each tradition, and differences of practice or belief.

We value voices that respect others, and believe that sharing our values and wisdom can lead us to act for the good of all.

We believe that our religious, spiritual lives, rather than dividing us, guide us to build community and respect for one another.

Therefore, as interdependent people rooted in our traditions, we now unite for the benefit of our Earth community.

We unite to build cultures of peace and justice.

We unite to heal and protect the Earth.

We unite to build safe places for conflict resolution, healing and reconciliation.

We unite to support freedom of religion and spiritual expression, and the rights of all individuals and peoples as set forth in international law.

We unite in responsible cooperative action to bring the wisdom and values of our religions, spiritual expressions and indigenous traditions to bear on the economic, environmental, political and social challenges facing our Earth community.

We unite to provide a global opportunity for participation by all people, especially by those whose voices are not often heard.

We unite to celebrate the joy of blessings and the light of wisdom in both movement and stillness.

We unite to use our combined resources only for nonviolent, compassionate action, to awaken to our deepest truths, and to manifest love and justice among all life in our Earth community.

Craig Henderson LaTokens,"Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity‚Äîfacilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.",Contributed Human Effort, 266,20240215

Craig Henderson LaTokens,"Hello good day everyone.

I talked to the approvals team regarding the LATOKEN listing. For a short amount of time I can reduce the final price to 5k from 10 but it would have to be paid in USDT or other¬†equivalent.

The main points are
*Can be listed for 5k total instead of 10k
*Needs to be USD 
*Can pay 3k in advance and 2K after IEO


If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.",Contributed Human Effort, 3,20240227
