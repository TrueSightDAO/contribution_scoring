After a long while of discovering and ping pongs (specifically me annoying gary) of figuring out how to help more efficiently in this environment. 

After months of pitching and nagging over every bit of my personal network and beyond.  succeeded to reach a good potential result.

At this stage I would need assistance into refining the deal for it to be accepted by the consensus of the members here.

Proposal :
 Partnership with non profit tech lab
How? 
They can subsidize the hiring of junior talent from tech and business fields

Up to 15k eur per talent

This was drawn under a deal that we called it "" the de risking of hiring juniors ""

The aim behind this deal is to up skill talent and job creations for Palestinians in Jerusalem (one of the very few totally unserved communities of the world) 

To conclude : we have access to budget to help talent contribute into our eco system

Emelin - Bahia,,"I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort,100.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded,100.00,20240912

Gary Teh,,"*Change of notarization*

When going through our main ledger I noticed that we might end up issuing more than 20,000 shares from TrueTech Inc under the following tokenization rule

- when fiat expenses are incurred by either @16468233438 or myself it gets tokenized as contributions made by TrueTech Inc
- ‚Å†For every 1TDG of tokens awarded to TrueTech Inc, 1 share in TrueTech Inc is issued to either @16468233438 or myself for expenses incurred.

As of right now, USD$15,218.37 worth of fiat expenses has already been collectively incurred between myself and Val. 
Looking at the main ledger, if we continue this rule, an additional USD$8,615 will end up getting tokenized which will push total number of TrueTech Inc shares beyond 20,000 units as authorized with the Delaware state government

In response to this, I have informed @16468233438 that future expenses incurred by myself during the course of building out our eco-system will get tokenized under GetData Inc. This leaves @16468233438 room 4781.63 shares in TrueTech Inc to achieve majoirty shareholder control of the our USA legal wrapper entity.
