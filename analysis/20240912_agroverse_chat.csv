[2/23/24, 10:29:48 AM] Gary Teh: Now that we have collected more qualitative data from the market on⁩ cacao nibs 

*Marketing 4Ps of our cacao nibs re-examined*

_*Product* differentiation versus existing USA competitors_

- larger sized chunks which means better quality because of care and deliberate attention during processing 
- ⁠the latest batch which shipped to @41799155602 is very balanced tasting due to care and deliberate attention during processing
- ⁠fresher due to less time on shelf due to our deliberate supply chain calibration
- ⁠leads to way more crunch 
- ⁠leads to way more flavor when you first bite into the nibs
- ⁠farming technique that restores our rainforest 
- ⁠we match the price of the competitors out there (_avoid price war_)

I don’t have direct access to the factory in São Paulo yet. I only have Dany as a contact person who connected me with this supplier.
The manufacturer in São Paulo shipped the sample to Dany who lives in Goiânia, in the state of Goiás. From Goiânia, Dany shipped the sample to Robert in Arkansas.

Gary Teh,,"I’m thinking the unique value proposition (_UVP_) might be different for the manufacturers (_like Robert_) and the grocers 

Reason is because we are selling packaged product to the grocers and raw materials to the manufacturers

Pain point of grocers is the ability to provide something that’s highly differentiated compared to the larger retail chains out so that consumers will visit their shop as opposed to just Walmart or Safeway which offer products that are cheaper and provide more variety

*_Our UVP to them: a product that consumers know when they buy helps restore the Amazon rainforest_*

manufacturers already have their own product. However, climate change is disrupting their supply chain thereby eating into their profit margin. What they are hoping for is the ability to protect their profit margin while still fulfilling their customer’s demand

*_our UVP to them, the ability to take control of their own Supply Chain, be fully in charge of their company’s own destiny  and no longer subjected to the oppression of the large middleman_*

Something to keep in mind when interacting with the two different customer profiles

[8/8/24, 12:01:21 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 15 minutes crafting up the product attribute sheet which differentiates the cacao nibs we are bringing into the USA compared to other cacao nibs that are available in the USA market

_Core Product Attributes:_

1. _Unique Flavor Profile_: Fine flavored organic cacao nibs with up to 90% fermentation, resulting in a strong aromatic flavor.
2. _Balanced Taste_: Suitable as a snack on its own, unlike other cacao nibs which are often used as raw ingredients.
3. _Competitive Pricing_: On par with or slightly lower than USA competitors due to supply chain optimization.
4. _Fermentation Level_: Up to 90% fermentation, compared to 70% or no fermentation in other cacao nibs.
5. _Post-Fermentation Processing_: Calibrated drying and roasting for the American taste bud, enhancing the flavor profile.
6. _Freshness_: Imported in small batches to ensure optimal freshness and crunchiness.

_Augmented Attributes:_

1. _Award-Winning Cacao_: International Cacao Excellence Award winner for 3 consecutive years.
2. _Single-Sourced_: Traceable to specific farms, ensuring transparency and quality control.
3. _Sustainable Farming_: Grown using traditional Cabruca Agroforestry method, promoting aforestation and reducing deforestation.
4. _Fair Trade Practices_: Farmers receive 34% of profits, encouraging continued use of sustainable farming methods.
5. _Environmental Impact_: Cabruca method balances land nutrients, eliminating the need for fertilizers and pesticides.
6. _Supply Chain Optimization_: Efficient supply chain management ensures competitive pricing without compromising quality.
7. _Region-Specific_: Sourced from Bahia, where unique terroir and climate conditions contribute to the distinct flavor profile.
8. _Texture_: Crunchy texture due to small-batch importing and optimal freshness.

This revised sheet highlights the added benefit of small-batch importing, ensuring the cacao nibs are exceptionally fresh and crunchy. ‎<This message was edited>

After negotiation and agreement, we are keeping the 4 reels divided (2 recipe reels and 1 agroverse and the connection with reforestation and as a community plus 1 video with the theme chosen by me) 4 HD pictures of lifestyle, farms, cocoa, ingredients, recipes processes, people interacting with the product and with the cacao).
[8/15/24, 11:52:46 AM] Emelin - Bahia: The sessions are recorded, the first one with @916380555310 contains one part of the talk, as the other part we were having in the marketing group.
[8/15/24, 11:53:44 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Once @14153000019 read the documents tomorrow and gives feedback if they are matching his expectations, I will have new updates.
[8/15/24, 11:56:29 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 15 minutes following up with @557391090002 @557191035605 and orlantildes this morning

[8/16/24, 7:07:35 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 30 minutes responding to Orlantildes email via WhatsApp

The process he quoted has deviated too much from our priorly agreed upon mathematical formula for calculating prices

Depending on his response, it could be construed as him breaking trust on his side and we cancelling the entire purchase order

This is a very critical

[8/18/24, 9:07:52 AM] Gary Teh: Spent 10 minutes explaining to @557191035605 how to derive the reasonable price of organic Cacao nibs from current commodity market price

_current commodity market price = USD$7.087_

_Organic Cacao price versus commodity price = 2X_

_Conversion rate of Cacao almond to Cacao nips = 1 : 1.25_

_cost of processing of per KG Cacao almond: USD1.5_

USD$7.087 X 2 X 1.25 + USD$1.50 = *USD$19.2175* ‎<This message was edited>

[8/21/24, 7:56:09 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605 and @557391090002 

I spent time thinking through the data that has came my way on the way expenses have been incurred for our content marketing efforts 

What I have observed for the past two weeks is that all the expenses both food ingredients and transport has been incurred by @557191035605 

Regarding the accounting and disbursement of the *_R$500 monthly budget*_ that I have set aside for our content marketing efforts, instead of transferring all of them to @557391090002 on the first day of each month, the new approach will be to disburse them to the reporter (_either @557191035605 or @557391090002_) within 2 banking days via Pix as soon as the reciept for the expenses has been submitted in this channel, validated and acknowledged by me 

*Reason for the change*

- The way the budget gets disbursed becomes more accountable 

- The reporter experiences less waiting time before receiving reimbursement for expenses incurred 

- The way the expenses gets disbursed becomes more equitable to the actual person (_either @557391090002 or @557191035605_) incurring the expenses. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/21/24, 7:57:05 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 30 minutes thinking through the logic of our content marketing expenses reimbursement process
[8/21/24, 8:03:11 AM] Gary Teh: I spent 10 minutes poking the President of CEPOTX cooperative and thinking through our cacao financing budget allocation

My resolution is that if we do not identify another viable supplier from the *_state of Bahia*_ by end of this month, the financing budget we have allocated for purchase of cacao shipment to the USA this year will all be directed to CEPOTX based in Para 

This means bumping up our purchase of cacao from 100kg to 500kg from *_CEPOTX in Para*_ 

If we are able to find an indigenous community that produces cacao in the *_state of Amazonas*_ during this period too, we will direct part of our financing budget to the newly identified indigenous supplier.

[8/21/24, 10:31:24 AM] Emelin - Bahia: My proposal:
[8/21/24, 10:31:26 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Video Content: keeping @557391090002 for video content, focusing on producing 3 high-quality videos (2 recipe videos and 1 on environment/farmers related to Agroverse or on Agroverse's economy model), based on @Gary Teh's expense proposal.

Design Replacement: Replace @916380555310with a skilled designer, such as Ian Sá, to handle static posts creation with me, scheduling, and other tasks, using the same budget that @916380555310 Suchitra used to only schedule and create copies for the videos. This was also base on the +9 hours time zone difference.

Marketing Management: I will be managing all aspects of marketing, including strategy development, advertising campaigns when they come, social media management, copywriting, art assistance, analysis, reporting, team coordination, and adaptation.
[8/21/24, 10:32:45 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I will be online for further clarification.
[8/21/24, 10:35:52 AM] Gary Teh: @557191035605

Regarding Ian, please have him fill up this time sheet as and when his time is engaged for work.

[8/21/24, 11:24:52 AM] Val Lapidus: @14153000019 was notified by the kitchen I use that they are losing their lease.  Let me know if I need to search for another kitchen for packaging.
[8/21/24, 11:27:39 AM] Gary Teh: Yes, please do so. 

Or even better, figure out how to get our own kitchen certified. I know Robert who is based in Arkansa did that.

That way, we can potentially ship our own machines from China to USA to process from cacao almonds to the following derivatives

- cacao nibs
- ⁠cacao liquor/mass / aka 100% bar

I checked on Alibaba.com the machine to remove shell and convert cacao almonds to nibs is not very expensive. 
The cheapest is around USD$250 

Apart from that all we need is a roaster (_regular oven would work_)
[8/21/24, 11:28:46 AM] Val Lapidus: I have the machine that converts to liquor

Gary Teh,,"I spent 10 minutes following up with Everton to find out the details of doing a triangular trade that he described last year

Where the farmer, cooperative or factory sell the Cacao to a CNPJ company that we will be setting up here in Brazil and the CNPJ company invoices the USA company

But his freighting company just picks up the Cacao from the farm corporative or factory and ship it directly to San Francisco and the CNPJ company does not have to deal with the logistic at all

That way, we only have to do FDA certification once for the CNPJ company for all future agriculture exports from Brazil into USA

Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer,,"TrueTech Inc spent 6 minutes editting a spread sheet for Emelin, in order for it to be used for planning content for social media posts.
[8/26/24, 9:51:38 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I would like to share some perspective on the social media here. Many followers are from Brazil. Probably people who were meeting Gary along the way. I expect a reduction in Brazilians followers due to the content we started to share and english is not our second language here. Because of this, a reduction in followers is expected until we get to redirect to our target public in the US.
[8/26/24, 9:53:23 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Also, I had some research and saw that Brazilians and north Americans act different in social media. In Brazil, we tend to follow by content but also, because we considered something beautiful. We find a function for that. In the US, people prefer to follow brands they already know, that they trust, that they see as ""not a scam"". It is a tendency to go for the known instead of the unknown.
[8/26/24, 9:54:25 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Because of this, the search for influencers is necessary. It will make people connect more and see themselves reflected on that person.
‎[8/26/24, 9:59:43 AM] Emelin - Bahia: ‎image omitted
[8/26/24, 10:00:57 AM] Emelin - Bahia: At this point, we need to reach influencers to make people in the US more comfortable with the brand. Consistency is also something that will keep us on the road. But @14153000019 what do we have to offer influencers and how was your approach with the shaman Willow?
[8/26/24, 10:02:36 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Still, it doesn't mean people will follow us, we are talking about the reach. For followers, we need to keep with the consistency of our posts and stories, using the material we already have because it will help people to see it is real, that the connection with Brazil is real, that the product is real and I aligned that posting client's pictures on the stories and also in the highlights, that is why is so important to feature them as well.
[8/26/24, 10:03:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @14153000019 I would like to have a meeting with you to know how your process going on Facebook has been so far in order to see how it can helps us reach the communities and groups we are interested.
[8/26/24, 10:03:58 AM] Emelin - Bahia: And also, to understand more of the behaviour. We also need to talk about the events.
[8/26/24, 10:12:03 AM] Gary Teh: Basically I offered my presence and friendship as well as the sharing of cacao when we are face to face. ‎<This message was edited>
[8/26/24, 10:15:29 AM] Gary Teh: Sure. My behavior has been to offer Free Amazonian cacao drinks at our cacao circles in USA during hippie festivals, technology events or during my personal spiritual wayfaring journey in USA.

Based on your analysis seems live meetups is still going to be leading the charge for our sales and marketing efforts

As the prices went high, I noticed the opening to discuss these prices which is good and also shows that talking with producers as a person in first place, not a foreign company and not mentioning it is for exportation makes it easier. 3. I Those who produce their own brand tend to have the highest price on the market for their ""raw"" nibs. 4.

[9/8/24, 11:55:08 AM] Meta AI: The country with a lower corporate taxation rate between the USA and Brazil is the USA. As of 2022, the USA has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%, while Brazil has a federal corporate tax rate of 34% (25% federal tax + 9% social contribution tax).

Regarding your question about where to book profits for taxation purposes, it's a complex issue that depends on various factors, such as the entity's structure, tax residency, and transfer pricing regulations. However, I can provide some general guidance:

- If your multinational entity is a US taxpayer, it's generally beneficial to book profits in the USA, taking advantage of the lower tax rate.
- However, you must ensure compliance with US transfer pricing rules, arm's length principles, and Brazilian tax regulations.
- Consider consulting a tax professional or expert in international taxation to ensure compliance and optimize your tax strategy.

Please note that tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and this response is not a substitute for professional tax advice. ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown,0,,0,20240907

[9/10/24, 8:56:56 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I will ask them if we will always need to classify the almond as weather and humidity can alter the final product, remembering we are using organic cacao, and so the final product can change.
[9/10/24, 9:04:29 AM] Emelin - Bahia: For next purchases, once again we should talk with the suppliers with more time, ask their harvesting periods in the year (I will ask one of them today) so we can reduce this cost. If we had all the almonds from the same batch and farmer, it would cost only USD 17,90. If we take the cacao almonds from two farmers, but from the same batch, it would cost  only USD35,89.
[9/10/24, 9:06:15 AM] Emelin - Bahia: So we are paying 53,71 because one of them didn't have more cacao to provide, what made us take 200kg from the same farmer but from different batches. @14153000019 more farmers we work with, more cost we will have with the almonds' test.

[9/12/24, 9:58:19 AM] Emelin - Bahia: @557381610166 I will need your help with the Instagram Account and to start the Linkedin strategy we discussed about it, at least for this week, because I need to keep going with the social media plans at work and focus on calling freight companies and comparing their possibilities and prices. Do you think you can cover me for this week?
[9/12/24, 10:12:13 AM] Ian - Emelin Friend Graphics Designer: Ok, I'll take care of the tasks,
[9/12/24, 10:12:53 AM] Emelin - Bahia: Thank you.
[9/12/24, 10:13:14 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We can meet at lunchtime halfway of your house. I need to buy some stuff.
[9/12/24, 10:15:16 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I want to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:05 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.
