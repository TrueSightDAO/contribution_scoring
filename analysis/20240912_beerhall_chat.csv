- granted access to use the San Francisco state university innovation labs facility whenever I am in town 

*_Next steps*_

- draft up the scope for inspiration leadership program which he will then surface to the professors for discussion 

- ⁠expected outcome is we will mentor selected students to build out specific aspects of @120363044028036610@g.us and TrueSight DAO

- ⁠scope 1: implementation of Shannon Biodiversity index via smart contracts on the blockchain for farms

- ⁠scope 2: extension of smart contract records by freighting companies and community warehouse managers

- ⁠scope 3: extend smart contracts for ratification by independent third party (_universities, churches, government_)

- ⁠scope 4: for voluntary contributions done by community members to move DAO project forward, mint them as as ledger entry in the blockchain in exchange for governance tokens

- ⁠will review what Stanley’s team has built so far to see what we could use for scope 1 through 4 the week after

In a world where everything is automated by Ai and Robots, the current paradigm where humans increasingly base their entire identity on their professional work is going to trigger mass depression and anxiety. Second order effect: war or suicide 

There needs to be a shift  to base identity on something else other than work as this legacy from the industrial age is going away. 

This is linking of Ai/Robots directly to mental health/spirituality here at the forum is our unique contribution to the discussion here at the forum. 

while these are two very pervasive themes here at the promenade, prior to this there has yet been much mentioned of any direct linkage between them.

- terraforming and human colony establishment using waste materials 

- ⁠folks living in the desert are right now having a hard time figuring out how to discard the waste generated via our linear economy 

- ⁠a prototype for the above is not different from one that illustrates how circular economy can be implemented in extreme environments 

- ⁠climate change is going to create more desert and ocean surface area (_extreme environments_)

- ⁠how do we adapt to this newly formed surfaced areas on earth (_extreme environment_)

- ⁠how do we take the learnings for our terraforming activities here on earth and apply it to Mars when the colonization process starts happening

Gary Teh,,"*_Reflections on the qualitative data received so far*_

*_Manufacturers*_ that utilize our raw material for their own final product, really only care about availability of supplies and price. if we go down this route, we will just end up haggling over price and margins with the buyer and the farmers. It will only further compound the inertia in the industry that is right now causing all these social and environmental problems, the source of all this negative PR in the industry right now.


When that the price of the end product matches with existing brands out there, *_USA Consumers*_ are very sensitive to the narrative/brand story. And will be very inclined to switch. All thanks to the 2020 pandemic and the increasing concerns about climate change... every new report of nature disasters that are attributed to climate change only serves to galvanize more support for the @120363044028036610@g.us brand story

Gary Teh,,"*Reflections for the Sunday*

- The final three hours yesterday evening was the most critical qualitative observation during this entire week since arriving in Altamira.

- Jedie pulled over on the highway while on our way back to Altamira when he saw a fellow organizer of the event had a flat tire. It was in the middle of nowhere where there was zero cell phone reception.

- He first tried to help change the tire using his own tools but quickly realize the nuts were a different size.

- He drove for 20 minutes to the nearby farm attempting to get help but realized the farm was closed.

- He drove for 30 minutes to a nearby restaurant attempting to get help.

- He managed to finally arrange for help to come.

- He drove back to the organizer’s truck to explain the help he has setup

- He brought loaded passenger on the other truck over to our truck to bring the passenger back to Altamira while help came

*Constrains he experienced during the entire situation*

- It’s been a long day, we were all physically tired especially since he went to bed pretty late the night before as well

- ⁠the sun has set. Road conditions were bad and it was pouring heavily

- ⁠The gear box of our truck was already on the verge of failing. He was praying for the gear box to continue holding before our drive back to Altamira

*Personal interpretation*

- If Jedie had a weaker character he could have just ignored the fellow participant who was experiencing trouble and continued going about his business.

- I always believe you can’t change a person’s character, but instead you could do is to be very diligent when selecting professional partners based on desirable character trait that they already exhibit when undertaking minor things.

- ⁠My interpretation from this, when issued a request, Jedie will to the utmost of his abilities deliver on the requirements. ‎<This message was edited>",100TDG For every 1 hour of human effort, 300.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 300.00,20240630

Gary Teh,,"Similar with Bahia, the earliest time they can start shipping will be in August. The impact of climate change is deeply felt across the board. 

Till now their warehouse is mostly empty and devoid of inventory, even though it is usually the case that harvest generally starts in May and inventory becomes available late May.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240702
Gary Teh,,"Spent 2 hours thinking through the qualitative data collected from the folks in the Bahia and Para community

the prevailing norm is for dominant chocolate manufacturers (_majority European based_) to import cacao from these communities, perform the manufacturing in Europe before redistributing the end products to the consumers, in the process capturing the bulk of the profit margin for themselves.

Analysis with the help of Meta AI shows that USA is in fact the world’s largest market for chocolate consumption. 

Shifting manufacturing away from Europe to the source countries and then importing the manufactured end product directly into USA if done properly will yield structural cost savings that will be hard for European manufacturers to compete against in the USA market (_we don’t incur logistic cost associated with having a European leg in our supply chain_). 

From my limited understanding, since there is a lot of labor union protection in these European, shifting their manufacturing to source countries for these companies is like pulling teeth. It will also generate very very bad PR for them domestically. But since we have zero legacy, we dont have this problem.

From this perspective, the *disruptive innovation/ differentiation is the structure of the supply chain itself*

- Importing directly into the USA, _the world's largest market_, from source countries
- Direct sourcing from small scale farming to support regenerative farming practices in the Amazon rainforest
- ⁠Stimulating local industry growth to eventually displace the dominant chocolate manufacturers
- Reducing carbon footprint by eliminating the European leg of the supply chain
- offer USA consumers high quality cacao as opposed to low quality cacao at the same prevailing price

The *final outcome*
- Environment: reduced carbon footprint and support for regenerative farming
- Consumers: high-quality cacao at a competitive price
- Local communities: economic growth and empowerment ‎<This message was edited>

[2/15/24, 10:29:58 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you the updated order form for the True Sight DAO LATOKEN listing.
Based on my experience and what I believe will best serve the project, I've implemented a few adjustments:
Dual AMAs: We're scheduling two AMA sessions instead of just one. The first will take place during the IEO/pre-listing phase, and the second will follow post-listing. This approach allows us to thoroughly educate our users/traders and leverage the content in future promotional campaigns.

Press Releases and Promotion: I've incorporated press releases and their promotion into our strategy. This move is instrumental for branding, allowing True Sight to control the narrative, enhance visibility, and build credibility. Moreover, it's beneficial for SEO purposes. The content from these press releases can also be repurposed for subsequent promotional efforts.

Co-marketing Activities: While the order form mentions one trading competition and one giveaway, rest assured, our campaign will include a broad range of co-marketing activities. The allocation will be determined by the DAO. I will collaborate closely with Gary (or another designated individual) and the account manager to craft co-marketing campaigns with strong calls to action (CTAs) that encourage community engagement and participation.

It's crucial to remember that an IEO doesn't guarantee fund-raising success. However, I've secured a very special deal for the DAO, covering both the total cost and payment terms. Should the IEO not fully cover the remaining balance, it will need to be settled before the trading pair goes live. Although our primary aim is fundraising, the IEO's value lies in marketing and promoting the project, attracting new token holders and community members. This package offers excellent value, encompassing website banner ads, an AMA, social media posts, newsletter inclusion, and more - activities that, individually, could cost tens of thousands.

This strategy ensures the project benefits from comprehensive promotional, marketing, and community-building activities throughout the IEO, listing, and post-listing phases.

Our main listing goals focus on liquidity—facilitating token trades with narrow bid-ask spreads and attracting new traders. This exposure will also help list the token on top trackers like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, DEXTools, etc., increasing visibility. The advantage of a CEX listing is significant cost savings compared to DEX listings, which require substantial liquidity pools and expensive marketing for visibility.
With all these factors in mind, I hope you appreciate the value a CEX listing brings. Comparable exchanges may charge around $40k, but remember, no listing is a silver bullet. Ongoing community and DAO support is vital, yet a CEX listing can significantly amplify our efforts and add credibility, visibility, and much-needed liquidity.
Looking forward to your feedback and moving forward together.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240708

[2/27/24, 10:19:20 AM] Craig Henderson LaTokens: Hello good day everyone.

I talked to the approvals team regarding the LATOKEN listing. For a short amount of time I can reduce the final price to 5k from 10 but it would have to be paid in USDT or other equivalent.

The main points are
*Can be listed for 5k total instead of 10k
*Needs to be USD 
*Can pay 3k in advance and 2K after IEO


If the DAO does want a listing on CEX its just a matter of assessing if there are the funds to pay. Most Tier 2  CEX such as LATOKEN will charge 20k.  Most of the lowest Tier 3 and 4 exchanges will charge min of 10 k and ask for a large number of tokens as well.

The listing would not have to happen right away however they would need to know asap if the DAO will move forward. preferably by the end of the month as this was a special consideration for this month. If we make a down payment of even 1k I can lock it in for when ever the DAO would like to commence.",1TDG For every 1 USD of liquidity injected, 100.00,Successfully Completed / Full Provision Awarded, 100.00,20240711

Gary Teh,,"Bumped into Eddy Diamantis, a FullBright scholar, undergoing internship for a U.S. law firm. He is undertaking an assignment for their firm on behalf of some USA govnerment. The goal is to figure out how to further increase USA foreign direct investment as well as near shoring in this region 

*_My interpretation*_

- USA barely has any foreign investment interest in Brazil 

- ⁠BRICS was signed last year and during which time Brazilian President has stated USA relationship is not of much significance compared to China trade relations

- ⁠China’s belt road initiative is really helped China gained lots of influence in this region 

- ⁠the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean have acted as very strategic moat for USA territory

- ⁠a scenario where China gains enough influence in a Latin American country to establish a Chinese naval base would present a headache especially one that is right along the shores of the Caribbean Sea.

- ⁠the Cuban missile was one of those scenarios which presented a lot of headache when it happened 

- ⁠the amount of natural resources Brazil has to back its foreign efforts is a few order of magnitude larger compared to Cuba’s. Hence more holding power if and when it takes roots

- ⁠before USA was dragged into WW2 by Japan, its stance was isolationistic and was primarily only concerned with what was happening in the Americas 

- ⁠USA policy has been tending towards isolationism these past few years 

*_What to watch out for from the US*_

- more concessions for imports from this region into USA 

- ⁠more policies to encourage USA foreign investments in this region 

- ⁠infrastructure improvements as near shoring trend gains momentum 

- ⁠price increase as near shoring trend builds momentum continues

Gary Teh,,"From the USA foreign direct investment and near shoring perspective displacing part of the $5 billion chocolate import and redirecting it from Brazil sounds reasonable 

- no USA jobs were lost

- ⁠encourage local community industrial growth 

- ⁠support climate change goals 

- ⁠deepen trade relationship with Brazil 

- ⁠displace Brazil trade relationship with China by reduced export of cattle and soy bean

_PS: it’s fascinating to observe how one simple action can cause such huge second and third order impact_

Makes more sense to tap directly into centigrade.earth for the carbon credit issue if they already have a streamlined process in place

If centigrade.earth already have buyers as well then I don’t see where nature wired would be impactful

Karen’s main value add will likely be marketing the issued carbon credit to potential buyers in the USA market if centigrade.earth does not already have a pipe line of carbon Credit buyers

But If she can’t find buyers for the carbon credit, I don’t really see where the actual value add is by complicating the technology stack allowing nature wired MVP into it 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>

[3/22/24, 11:27:20 AM] Gary Teh: *insight from this morning’s 1 hour meditation*

After much curation within my personal network, looking back at 20 years of personal data as well as reading through the biographies of the top organization builders, the most important function within any organization with a commercial intent is *_Marketing (making money 💰💸💵💶💷💴🤑)*_

*_Sources*_
- Ryu - business developer
- ⁠Jerry Luk - President of Fireworks
- ⁠Peter Gwee - DAO member, 3 generation business man in the fenshui industry 
- ⁠Dad - third generation business man in the food distribution industry
- ⁠Vinod Nair - CEO money smart 
- ⁠Richard Brandon 
- ⁠Elon Musk
- ⁠@6598383264 

PS: when the *_marketing (making money)*_ function works wells, the rest of the function will automatically work well of their own accord 

Creators are drawn to a space because they enjoy the process of building a product. 

Paradoxically, to really be successful in a space, creators have to step away from the product development function and focus on the organization building itself and most especially through marketing function.

Creators that have been observed to struggle are those who cling on for too long to the product building instead of letting otters handle it. 

When the marketing function works well and starts bringing in 💴💷💶💵💸🤑, specialists from various functions will naturally get attracted into the organization to support in the other functions ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240716

_PS: heard from Suni that there was another project which attempted at carbon credit… Somehow it failed… Will need to figure out why it did_

_For the current scope, might be prudent to just focus on getting the cacao trees planted and growing. If it works then its reasonable to consider extending it for carbon credit issue._

Gary Teh,,"Spent an hour facetime with Karen Hardy

*Key Takeaways on what was discussed*
- Nature.Wired: expects to take 3-4 month to build their initial market interface…
- right now seeking funding to build initial user interface from XRP Ledger
- I strongly suggest to just use Wix.com, pay USD15 per month and immeditely bootstrap the onboarding of buyers rather than waste time getting stalled by XRP's indecision
- says Centigrade.earth is a digital workflow much like TuboxTax for carbon credit. It has an API
- UC Berkeley CarbonSustain program will be the lead generation to find carbon credit buyers

*Key Learnings from her prior failed project*
- project: Intrinsic Method
- Goal: reforestation project in Brazil by planting 1,000 trees
- Location: Rancho Do Montana owned by some high profile celebrity
- struggling to get the completion of the trees to be planted.
- Was looking for upfront funding but failed
- Complications on where to plant the trees
- The transaction fees did not work as the grower wanted more cash than the owner wanted to give

*My take on that failure scenario*
- Agroverse is a guaranteed buyer for the cacao produced by the indigenous so long as they plant the trees
- The cacao trees will be planted whether the carbon credits get issued since there is sufficient economic incentive for all parties involved.
- ⁠we should however capitalize the effort to the fullest extend possible by not just getting the cacao almonds but also getting the carbon credits issued.

*Next Step:*
- Karen will arrange demo session with Centigrade.Earth for me
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the required record keeping workflow
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the offline workflow for recording the tree keeping
- during session with Centigrade.Earth will find out the cost of hiring an auditor to inspect the tree keeping for issuing carbon credit. ‎<This message was edited>

Prior to this, no one from the centralized exchanges seem to care or were interested to talk to us (_not that we tried very hard_)

Suddenly, we have a huge influx of centralized cryptocurrency exchange listing managers queueing up wanting us to list our governance tokens on their centralized exchanges

My sense is the fact the trading value of our governance tokens on the LATOKEN exchanges is holding up has provided a strong signal that the underlying token economics of our DAO  is financially sound hence why it caught their interest

_PS: my sense is we should maintain the relationship and hold them at bay while we focus on our core operations which is to drive the sales volume of shipments into USA_

_once we have hit the 50% sales completion mark of the next shipment, negotiate for the best deal from amongst these other CEX and then list on just one. This will help maintain if not boost the sense of exclusivity that comes with the opportunity to list our governance tokens_

- cacao butter manufacturing facility does not have the sanitario certification from Brazil to handle export to USA
- ⁠ cacao molasses facility is right now two facilities. Interim facility and new facility.
- ⁠weather condition is too bad for us to drive to the farm to inspect the equipment used to drain cacao honey from cacao beans

- ⁠Orlantildes will provide the photo of the equipment on the farm that drains the cacao honey from the cacao beans 
- ⁠Orlantildes will provide exact details on how cacao molasses are processed from cacao honey

After volunteering to help man her store while she went to visit the bathroom, she mentioned when mailing the same package from Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil to Europe, the shipping cost is so vastly different

Directing all of them to our telegram channel where they can wait for update on when they can finally gain an audience with DAO

_PS: from my perspective, channeling updates via telegram is the most effective way of disseminating information to non-governance token holders who wants to get something from the DAO, but not ready or motivated to put it any resource on their part to exchange for what they desire (aka Nothing)._

_in telegram nobody knows who anyone else is. So everyone is kept on the toes guessing who the other people on the channel are and if they are competitors for the resources or resource controllers_

[8/3/24, 11:41:46 AM] Gary Teh: Just did up the initial financial projection for the upcoming shipment from Coopercabruca - *_aka AGL3*_

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ji-p9z6fMhb0A30lsW2r0hryzJGsDRBgM3vRnn9tCiU/edit?gid=0#gid=0

- Estimate cost of goods before freighting and customs clearance cost to be financed: $10,876.19
- ⁠Total expected returns on shipment: $12,183.81 (_112.02%_)
- ⁠Total amount to be made by DAO after shipment sales completion in USA market: $10,514.64
- ⁠Total returns to financiers: $1,669.17 (_15.35% return on capital injected_)

_PS: DAO needs to recoup the resources it has already deployed so far to build out the supply chain between Brazil and USA_

_My sense is the exceptionally high Gas fee of 86% charged by DAO will probably turn off most financiers, however let’s just consider it already been fully financed_

_If AGL3 gets fully sold out wonderful, Agroverse project will continue. If not, then we will shutdown Agroverse along with the entire DAO. Then I will finally enter into the Zen monastery for permanent wall facing_ ‎<This message was edited>
[8/3/24, 11:56:18 AM] Gary Teh: From my perspective, this shipment is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. 

On the bright side, We have 1 year upon arrival of shipment within the borders of USA to fully offload the entire shipment before it gets donated in its entirety to @16504369509 project for homeless rehabilitation and the @120363044028036610@g.us and the DAO shutdown in its entirety

Gary Teh,,"Was speaking with @557191035605 yesterday and this crystallized during the conversation

*Our purpose*
Heal the world with love by building a better world based on verifiable truth 

*Our core values*
- autonomy
- ⁠integrity
- ⁠diversity

*Our mission*
Sell organic cacao grown using cabruca regenerative technique in the Amazon rainforest so as to finance the planting of trees via cabruca agroforestry to restore it. 

*Vision* 
Shift 1% of total US chocolate consumption to organic cacao grown in the Amazon rainforest using cabruca regenerative technique by 2030. 

*Key statistics*
- _Total USA chocolate consumption in 2023 was USD$19 billion._
- _1% is USD$190 million._

I spent 10 minutes drafting this up

And now we have a diversity and community of three 🤣
[8/17/24, 10:18:19 AM] Gary Teh: *Suspended the purchase order issued to Coopercabruca*

The prices they quoted for the cacao nibs and the cacao liquor are not competitive for the US market 

I observe they purchase from the farmers and resell with a markup (_of 40%_), this technically makes them a middleman.

Getting @557191035605‘s help to do a sanity check on the price against the other corporatives in Bahia 

If overall prices are at the level which is not competitive in the USA, we will suspend all shipment from Brazil this year

However if the variance of the prices are very high after doing the sanity check on prices with the other cooperatives, then it makes sense for us to establish a Local Brazilian legal wrapper entity to gain further control over the Supply Chain and to further reduce *_middlemen leakages*_

If we do go down this route, The CEO for the Brazilian legal entity will be elected based on the following criteria: 

_the DAO member with highest amount of TDG accumulated from amongst all DAO members with legal Brazilian residency over the past 12 months_

*Scope of Brazilian legal entity*

- Sourcing direct from farmers

- ⁠ generation of sales and marketing content for social media

- ⁠ sales and marketing activities into USA ‎<This message was edited>
[8/17/24, 10:28:46 AM] Gary Teh: _PS: in this scenario the title of CEO is literally a pun on the person that executed the most in the region._

_This is literally one of those classic Elon Musk first principles moment where we examine the Supply Chain and realize very quickly to our self that the 40% markup represents around approximately US$9000._

_This money could otherwise be used to go a long way towards establishing a replica of that section of the Supply Chain that was previously handled by middleman and securing long term cost savings. Savings that could be used to boost the value of our TDG 🤔_ ‎<This message was edited>

[8/22/24, 9:19:55 AM] Gary Teh: Now that _*OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)_* have became more widely adopted in our DAO and we have worked with it for a few iterations, I figure it is a good time for me to share my thoughts on it

From my perspective, *_Objectives_* has to do with processes and concrete tasks within the processes that DAO member undertakes. It is deterministic. By just looking at the logs, we can determine if a DAO member consistently been executing on process or not.

*_Key results_* are the outcomes. Until time set is due, we do not know for sure if the outcomes will be within our desired target range. They are probabilistic. Only a very small fraction of the inputs are within the control of DAO member undertaking the process driving these outcomes. The form of control DAO member has is the way tasks are conducted within the processes. 

The best thing we can do to improve outcome is to share with the DAO what we have learned that work and what did not as we iterate through the different variants of our processes.

Over the past quarter, I have been undertaking a very systematic process of identifying various DAO members whom I then later communicated clearly, I will not engaging in any future form of transactions within the realms of commerce, investments and money. This is primarily because enough data has been gathered to show that when given the opportunity to execute on a self-defined and agreed upon process, instead of a deterministic outcome, it ends up being a probabilistic one.

A rule I learned from our fellow DAO member Ilya who manages a hedge fund in Wall Street which seems very applicable to our domain. A fund manager cannot be faulted on _*the OUTCOME_* of a trading strategy but must definitely be faulted when he fails to diligently follow the defined trading strategy (_the PROCESS_).

[9/3/24, 10:05:24 AM] Gary Teh: Shena spent 30 minutes last week explaining how convenience stores work since she owned and operated one for 5 years 

Vendors typically come in to check the stock and stock up every week 

For the operator, basically the initial investment is the largest 

Thereafter she only pays for what is required to stock up the inventory to the required level 

Typical profit margin is 10% 

Some really good products are like the ones she created herself. The profit margin 100% profit margin. She handmade some fishing baits. It costed her $.28 per bait. And she sold it for $5.

When she bought the convenience store, it already came with a bunch of vendor relationships 

Vendors should consider entering the shop to speak to the owner give a sample and help the owner Decide if she wants to stock the inventory.

Emelin - Bahia,,The *absence of residues from cleaning agents or pesticides*,Unknown, 0,, 0,20240903
Emelin - Bahia,,"To ensure that a cacao tree is part of a totally organic production system, several key practices and principles need to be followed. Here’s a comprehensive look at what makes cacao production organic:

1. No Synthetic Chemicals
Pesticides and Herbicides: Organic cacao production avoids synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Instead, it uses natural pest control methods and organic-approved substances.
Fertilizers: Chemical fertilizers are replaced with organic fertilizers like compost, manure, and green manure.
2. Soil Health and Management
Organic Matter: Organic farming emphasizes the use of organic matter to maintain soil fertility. This includes composting, mulching, and green manuring.
Soil Conservation: Techniques such as cover cropping and reduced tillage are used to maintain soil health and prevent erosion.
3. Pest and Disease Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM): Organic cacao farms use IPM strategies, which include biological control agents (like beneficial insects), companion planting, and manual removal of pests.
Disease Prevention: Practices such as proper spacing, pruning, and the use of resistant cacao varieties help prevent disease.
4. Sustainable Farming Practices
Water Management: Efficient water use and conservation practices are crucial to prevent waterlogging and maintain soil structure.
Biodiversity: Organic cacao farms often incorporate agroforestry practices, maintaining a diverse ecosystem to support natural predators and improve soil health.
5. Certification
Organic Certification: To be recognized as organic, cacao farms must obtain certification from an accredited organic certifying body. This involves adhering to specific standards and undergoing regular inspections.
6. Non-GMO Seeds
Seed Sourcing: Organic cacao production requires using non-GMO seeds and plants. Cacao varieties should be chosen based on their organic compatibility.
7. Sustainable Practices
Energy Use: Organic farms strive to use renewable energy sources and reduce their carbon footprint.
Waste Management: Organic cacao producers manage waste through composting and recycling to minimize environmental impact.
8. Ethical Labor Practices
Fair Trade: Many organic cacao farms also follow fair trade principles, ensuring fair wages and ethical treatment of workers.
9. No Synthetic Additives in Processing
Processing: When processing cacao, organic certification ensures that no synthetic additives, artificial flavors, or colors are used.",Unknown, 0,, 0,20240903

Emelin - Bahia,,"1. Verification of the Certificate
Confirmation with the Certifier: The seal usually includes the name of the certifying body. You can verify the validity of the seal by contacting the certifying body directly or visiting their official website to confirm if the farm is listed as certified.
2. Seal Consistency
Authenticity of the Seal: Make sure the seal looks authentic and is from a recognized certification organization. A counterfeit seal or one from an unknown organization may be a red flag.
3. International Recognition
Recognized Certifying Bodies: Check if the seal belongs to a certification body recognized internationally, such as USDA Organic (USA), EU Organic (European Union), or other certifications recognized in your country.
4. Farm Documentation
Request Documentation: If possible, ask the farm or supplier for more information about the certification, including documents and records proving compliance with organic standards.
5. Transparency and Traceability
Additional Information: Organic products often come with information about their origin and the certification process. Transparency in how the product was grown and processed is a good sign of authenticity.
6. References and Reviews
Research the Farm: If possible, research the reputation of the farm or supplier. Feedback from other consumers and reliable references can help ensure authenticity.
7. Consider Brand Trustworthiness
Reputable Brands: Buying from reputable brands and distributors with experience in organic products can increase confidence that the seal is legitimate.

[9/12/24, 10:15:34 AM] Emelin - Bahia: I wanted to provide an update on our current efforts regarding our content strategy. As part of our ongoing commitment to optimizing our outreach and engagement, we are making several adjustments to our approach. Specifically, we are refining our content strategy, adjusting our posting frequency, and reevaluating our audience targeting.

One of the notable changes we've implemented involves a shift in our content focus. Previously, we had a heavier emphasis on Brazilian content. However, to better align with our goal of expanding our reach and engagement in international markets, we've been increasing our English-language content. This strategic pivot aims to enhance our visibility and relevance outside of our traditional Brazilian audience.

As a result of these adjustments, you might notice a decrease in some of our previous metrics. This is partly due to the transition from a predominantly Brazilian audience to a more diversified, global one. We are actively working to increase our international presence and improve our performance metrics as we continue to implement these changes.
[9/12/24, 10:20:10 AM] Emelin - Bahia: We appreciate your ongoing support and are confident that these strategic adjustments will contribute to our long-term success. *We need the support of our community by commenting in the content we create*. The more comments we have, *Instagram's algorithm pushes to show our content*. So it is important to have the *engagement of our community*.
