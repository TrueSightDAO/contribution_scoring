When you make the withdrawal in Brazilian R$ please also withdraw the amount for interest you would have otherwise made had the loan amount you provided to the DAO stayed deployed in your own investment account.

Gary Teh,"Part of the conversation had with @41799155602 today was regarding fundraising 

We technically don’t really have much use for the funds 

What we really need now is relationship that potential investors have with the distributors and retailers more so than we need their money 

Taking investor money is more for the purpose of forcing them to put their money where their mouth is. Literally tapping into the *_sunk cost fallacy cognitive bias*_ and the *_consistency cognitive bias*_. 

*_Sunk cost fallacy*_
Once your money is parked here, it is less likely you will invest your relationship in another competing project which is basically like shooting yourself in the foot. 

This is an effective way of keeping out copycat projects that attempt to replicate the same route with the same set of investors 

VCs have this policy where they do not invest in another competing company once they have placed their bet on what they think is a winning horse in the space.

And those with integrity will inform incoming teams of their existing positions before clearing saying no to them. 

*_Consistency bias*_
Once you said yes to a small ask, it is more likely you will say yes to a bigger ask later one. As For smaller ask later on, go figure…

Also a slightly larger treasury also tend to give a sense of formidability which has the effect of discouraging other copy cats when they see the size of the balance sheet. Though technically having a strong balance does not always lead to more effective execution and at times serve more as a distraction… I could personally attest to this… it is much better for DAO members to be forced to be scrappy and justify the use of every single dollar in our vault than to be irresponsibly throwing DAO funds around chasing after bullshit ideas (… _and become the next SBF_… )

Gary Teh,"Part of the conversation had with @41799155602 today was regarding fundraising 

We technically don’t really have much use for the funds 

What we really need now is relationship that potential investors have with the distributors and retailers more so than we need their money 

Taking investor money is more for the purpose of forcing them to put their money where their mouth is. Literally tapping into the *_sunk cost fallacy cognitive bias*_ and the *_consistency cognitive bias*_. 

*_Sunk cost fallacy*_
Once your money is parked here, it is less likely you will invest your relationship in another competing project which is basically like shooting yourself in the foot. 

This is an effective way of keeping out copycat projects that attempt to replicate the same route with the same set of investors 

VCs have this policy where they do not invest in another competing company once they have placed their bet on what they think is a winning horse in the space.

And those with integrity will inform incoming teams of their existing positions before clearing saying no to them. 

*_Consistency bias*_
Once you said yes to a small ask, it is more likely you will say yes to a bigger ask later one. As For smaller ask later on, go figure…

Also a slightly larger treasury also tend to give a sense of formidability which has the effect of discouraging other copy cats when they see the size of the balance sheet. Though technically having a strong balance does not always lead to more effective execution and at times serve more as a distraction… I could personally attest to this… it is much better for DAO members to be forced to be scrappy and justify the use of every single dollar in our vault than to be irresponsibly throwing DAO funds around chasing after bullshit ideas (… _and become the next SBF_… )

that is why our DAO’s treasury till now continues to looks so broke from the perspective of an unsuspecting outsider 🤔🤣 ‎<This message was edited>",Unknown, 0,20240103

@41799155602 will also be a director sitting on the board of the Swiss association (_since he is the only Swiss that has volunteered for the board so far and has consistently contributed during the life cycle of our DAO as we came to each critical checkpoint along our journey_)

- Integrity without compromising on Privacy

- ⁠A well defined ethical framework within which members can operate with full autonomy

Regarding point 2: this is part of the reason why there has been a recent heavy influx of new members into our @120363044542957540@g.us. Bulk of these new members are steeped in various spiritual traditions and ethical frameworks.",Contributed Human Effort, 0,20240206

- ⁠*match* is when self actualization path of applicant and needs of guild for next 90 days coincides

- ⁠during every equinox/solstice, existing guild members are invited to share their personal 90 day action plan to further the mission of the guild 

- ⁠if there is existing guild member can’t figure an action plan for themselves they can invite other guild members to propose an action plan for them which they might feel enthusiastic about

Gary Teh,"From my perspective, this is a looser more decentralized version of the Sprint protocol commonly used in teams using agile 

I observed @33652866472 attempting to use Sprint in House of Balance last year. It did not turn out very well. 

From my perspective, the primary reason is because the required level of effort coordination between various team members in a sprint as well as the frequency of the cadence is too high considering everyone has their own daily jobs to attend to. 

From my experience, running product development teams, when members are very experienced and senior in their domain, the best approach is to start by first sitting with them to determine what is the epic quest they feel strongly for, and then help them define their own goal they want to achieve at the end of this epic quest of theirs. Thereafter work backwards and break down the quest into smaller chunks. Finally just get out of the way, but periodically do a check in with them. 

For quests that require tighter coordination between team members, it’s best to colocate the team members for the duration of the quest. 

Back in the previous startup we had this concept called the _war room_ where the entire product development team was colocated in the same room for an duration until a very specific (_usually very critical_) milestone is hit (_usually a product launch or a major crisis is averted_). 

I understood from Brian (_another DAO member_) when Google wave was being launched way back then, the entire product team were shipped over to Sydney and then colocated in an office till it finally got launched. Back when I was on his team a few startups ago, when we were getting from seed stage to Series A, we were just in war room by default the entire 1.5 years

I personally tested the war room concept with @5511982667030 and then later @16468233438 when we were setting up the supply chain of cacao nibs from the rainforest to USA. Turn around time was in hours rather than in days. 

_PS: something to note, different teams end up implementing sprint differently depending on their group dynamics_ 🙂🙏 ‎<This message was edited>",Contributed Human Effort, 1,20240210
